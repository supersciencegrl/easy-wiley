         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>

This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

         <title>Anisotropic Microcarriers: Fabrication Strategies and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have gained prominence for their morphological versatility. This review synthesizes two decades of advances in AM development, from fabrication strategies to multifunctional biomedical applications (cell coculture, multidrug delivery, tissue scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting). Systematic analysis of morphology&#8208;dependent effects underscores opportunities for optimizing AM utilization and establishing morphology&#8208;driven innovation frameworks in biomedicine.








Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds. These countermeasures include specific fabrication strategies for various morphologies and guidelines for selecting the most suitable AM for certain biomedical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of AMs, ranging from their fabrication methods to biomedical applications, based on the past two decades of research, is provided. The fabrication of various morphologies is investigated using different strategies and their corresponding biomedical applications. By systematically examining these morphology&#8208;dependent effects, a better utilization of AMs with diverse morphologies can be achieved and clear strategies for breakthroughs in the biomedical field are established. Additionally, certain challenges are identified, new frontiers are opened, and promising and exciting opportunities are provided for fabricating functional AMs with broad implications across various fields that must be addressed in biomaterials and biotechnology.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

         <title>Unlocking Multimodal Nonlinear Microscopy for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging under Continuous&#8208;Wave Excitation with Tunable Upconverting Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous&#8208;wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep&#8208;tissue 3D imaging, video&#8208;rate wide&#8208;field imaging, and depth&#8208;selective photomodulation. High&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost&#8208;effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare&#8208;earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co&#8208;doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), blue (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), and NIR (&#955; &#8776; 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi&#8208;colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 &#181;mm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide&#8208;field video&#8208;rate imaging under low&#8208;powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth&#8208;selective, 3D&#8208;localized photo&#8208;modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio&#8208;imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Multimodal Finger&#8208;Shaped Tactile Sensor for Multi&#8208;Directional Force and Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real&#8208;time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human&#8211;computer interaction, but real&#8208;time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single&#8208;electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real&#8208;time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

         <title>Photochromic Control in Hybrid Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine is applied to halide perovskite materials and the corresponding solar cells, demonstrating photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques. This results in improvements in photovoltaic performances and operational stabilities, highlighting the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in photovoltaics.








Abstract
The application of perovskite photovoltaics is hampered by issues related to the operational stability upon exposure&#160;to external stimuli, such as voltage bias and light. The dynamic control of the properties of perovskite materials in response to light could ensure the durability of perovskite solar cells, which is especially critical at the interface with charge&#8208;extraction layers. We&#160;have applied a functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine at the interface with hole&#8208;transport layers in the corresponding perovskite solar cells with the aim of stabilizing them in response to voltage bias and light. We demonstrate photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. As a result, the application of the photochromic derivative offers improvements in photovoltaic performance and operational stability, highlighting&#160;the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Regulating Electron Distribution in Regioisomeric Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

RuCrAPs modify the electronic structure of RuNPs as active sites through the optimised electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) and enhanced water adsorption and dissociation.








Abstract
Precisely optimizing the electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) of the electrocatalysts and tuning the electronic structures of active sites are crucial for accelerating water adsorption and dissociation kinetics in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, an effective strategy is applied to modify the electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) by incorporating Ru single atoms (RuSAs) and Ru and Cr atomic pairs (RuCrAPs) onto a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (N&#8211;C) support through optimized EMSI. The resulting catalyst, RuNPs&#8208;RuCrAPs&#8208;N&#8208;C, shows exceptional performance for alkaline HER, achieving a six times higher turnover frequency (TOF) of 13.15 s&#8315;&#185; at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, compared to that of commercial Pt/C (2.07 s&#8315;&#185;). Additionally, the catalyst operates at a lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8315;2 (&#951;10 = 31&#160;mV), outperforming commercial Pt/C (&#951;10 = 34&#160;mV). Experimental results confirm that the RuCrAPs modified RuNPs are the main active sites for the alkaline HER, facilitating the rate&#8208;determining steps of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the Ru&#8211;Cr interaction also plays a vital role in modulating hydrogen desorption. This study presents a synergistic approach by rationally combining single atoms, atomic pairs, and nanoparticles with optimized EMSI effects to advance the development of efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Ionic Engineering of Antiferromagnetically RKKY&#8208;Coupled Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random&#8208;access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage&#8208;driven ion migration (i.e., magneto&#8208;ionics) enables post&#8208;synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto&#8208;ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non&#8208;magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto&#8208;ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum&#8208;group metals. In this work, room&#8208;temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni&#8208;based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion&#8208;like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage&#8208;driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage&#8208;triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post&#8208;synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic&#8208;field sensing, energy&#8208;efficient memories and spintronics.

Its scalable production and cost&#8208;effectiveness advance energy&#8208;saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth afterglow materials, with their unique light&#8208;storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare&#8208;earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large&#8208;area (0.4&#160;m &#215; 3&#160;m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire&#8208;rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24&#8208;h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real&#8208;world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Stable In Situ Acetylene Detection in Transformer Oil Using Polyimide&#8208;Embedded Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gas sensor capable of monitoring acetylene in situ in a fluidic medium with high sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response, and long stability is developed using carbon nanotube&#8208;embedded polyimide. The sensor, with a built&#8208;in carbon&#8208;nanotube&#8208;based heater, maintains the optimal temperature for maximum performance in transformer oil even under severe mechanical stress, ensuring commercial&#8208;standard durability.








Abstract
This study presents an acetylene gas sensor capable of in situ monitoring transformer oils. This sensor utilizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in polyimide (PI) synthesized by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. Unlike conventional sensors that target hydrocarbon gases dissolved in oil and measure the gas extracted from the oil, the proposed CNT&#8208;PI sensor detects gas within the oil in real time. The PI embedding technique effectively anchors and shields the CNT network against fluidic damage, ensuring stable sensing performance over 6 months, even under friction stress caused by oil convection. Decorating CNTs with gold nanoparticles further enhances the sensitivity and response of the sensor. The sensor achieves a high response (10.5% at 30&#160;ppm) and fast response/recovery times (28 s/77 s), Furthermore, the sensor demonstrates good response (10.4% at 30&#160;ppm) and moderate response/recovery times (444 s/670 s) in an oil medium, which qualifies for industrial applications. Additionally, a CNT&#8208;PI&#8208;based heater is integrated into the sensor as a multilayer component, maintaining an optimal operating temperature of 90 &#176;C. The CNT&#8208;PI sensor demonstrates consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 10,000 bending cycles and exhibits superior characteristics, indicating its compatibility with various forms of transformers.

The sensor achieves a high response (10.5% at 30&#160;ppm) and fast response/recovery times (28 s/77 s), Furthermore, the sensor demonstrates good response (10.4% at 30&#160;ppm) and moderate response/recovery times (444 s/670 s) in an oil medium, which qualifies for industrial applications. Additionally, a CNT-PI-based heater is integrated into the sensor as a multilayer component, maintaining an optimal operating temperature of 90 &#176;C. The CNT-PI sensor demonstrates consistent gas-sensing performance even after 10,000 bending cycles and exhibits superior characteristics, indicating its compatibility with various forms of transformers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free all solid&#8208;state batteries (AF&#8208;ASSBs) employ &#8220;empty&#8221; current collector with three active interfaces that determine electrochemical stability; lithium metal &#8211; Solid electrolyte (SE) interphase (SEI&#8208;1), lithium &#8211; current collector interface, and collector &#8211; SE interphase (SEI&#8208;2). Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) solid electrolyte (SE) displays SEI&#8208;2 containing copper sulfides, formed even at open circuit. Bilayer of 140&#160;nm magnesium/30&#160;nm tungsten (Mg/W&#8208;Cu) controls the three interfaces and allows for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in half&#8208;cells and fullcells. AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811 cathode achieves 150 cycles with Coulombic efficiency (CE) above 99.8%. With high mass&#8208;loading cathode (8.6 mAh cm&#8722;2), AF&#8208;ASSB retains 86.5% capacity after 45 cycles at 0.2C. During electrodeposition of Li, gradient Li&#8208;Mg solid solution is formed, which reverses upon electrodissolution. This promotes conformal wetting/dewetting by Li and stabilizes SEI&#8208;1 by lowering thermodynamic driving force for SE reduction. Inert refractory W underlayer is required to prevent ongoing formation of SEI&#8208;2 that also drives electrochemical degradation. Inert Mo and Nb layers likewise protect Cu from corroding, while Li&#8208;alloying layers (Mg, Sn) are less effective due to ongoing volume changes and associated pulverization. Mechanistic explanation for observed Li segregation within alloying LixMg layer is provided through mesoscale modelling, considering opposing roles of diffusivity differences and interfacial stresses.

Anode&#8208;Free All Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The scene is the Animas Mountains range on the planet Mars. The first explorer and a mechanical rover stand facing another freezing sunrise, wind howling as a dust storm gathers strength, the thin air humming with radiation, an unconcerned landscape where anything is permitted. Powering the life support system and the rover are anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries, charting a path that others will follow in due time.

Multiparameter Detection
In article number 2410946, Ningsheng Xu, Shaozhi Deng, and co&#8208;workers propose plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) to construct monolithic multifunctional detector. With a footprint one&#8208;tenth the incident wavelength, the detector offers benchmarking intensity&#8208;, frequency&#8208;, and polarization&#8208;sensitive detection, rapid response, and sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution, all operating at room temperature across 0.22 to 4.24 THz. The unique advantages of PPAC detector make it promising for high&#8208;resolution imaging and polarization&#8208;coded communication.

Interfacial Atomic Mechanisms
In article number 2414317, Huaze Zhu, Huashan Li, Wei Kong, and co&#8208;workers reveal the interfacial atomic mechanisms governing the epitaxial growth of single&#8208;crystalline molybdenum disulfide on sapphire substrates. Through high&#8208;resolution characterization and theoretical calculations, the critical role of interfacial composition in determining single&#8208;crystalline quality is elucidated. These findings provide new theoretical insights for the controlled growth of single&#8208;crystalline two&#8208;dimensional materials.

Low&#8208;Field Magnetoresistance
In article number 2415426 by Yanan Zhao, Zhixin Guo, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers a notable low&#8208;field magnetoresistance (1.2&#215;103%, 0.1 T) in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films at a high temperature range (&#8776;90&#8211;240 K) is obtained. Such layered phases raise the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains. The achievement of such notable LFMR at high temperatures would advance the magnetic devices.

Biomimetic Metamaterials
In article number 2416314 by Xiaoming Liu, Qiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers, a novel metamaterial design, metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal metamaterials with dual coupling gradient resonators, is proposed for broadband absorption. By transforming &#8220;resonance points&#8221; into &#8220;resonance bands&#8221; and perfect coupling of the two gradient resonators in nanoscale and microscale dimensions, the GR&#8208;MIMs with a thickness of only 200 nm demonstrates ultra&#8208;broadband high absorption across the ultraviolet, visible, near&#8208;infrared, and mid&#8208;infrared spectra.

Biomimicry
In article number 2413939, Ulrich B. Wiesner and co&#8208;workers describe a science&#8208;art collaboration culminating in a 14&#8208;meter&#8208;tall art installation with ultra large molar mass block copolymer&#8208;based structural color, mimicking the optical behavior of a Morpho butterfly wing. Routes to overcoming the challenges of scaling up block copolymer synthesis and reproducible film formation to the architectural scale are addressed. The approach to generating films with block copolymer&#8208;based structural color is then broadened to include iridescent hybrid materials as well as ceramics.

         <title>Machine Learning in Polymer Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated every aspect of science, including polymer research. Researchers from both fields need to collaborate to understand the challenges and opportunities of each domain. This review is therefore written by mathematicians and polymer chemists to highlight the key research questions polymer chemists aim to address and how machine learning can assist in answering them.








Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid&#8208;state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer&#8211;biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine&#8211;human interface are shared.

         <title>Thermal Transport in Chalcogenide&#8208;Based Phase Change Materials: A Journey from Fundamental Physics to Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>

Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are transforming reconfigurable photonics with their electrically tunable optical properties. This review examines the thermal challenges of scaling PCM devices to larger volumes beyond storage&#8208;class applications, emphasizing thermal transport mechanisms, material properties, and design strategies. By integrating fundamental science and device engineering, it offers valuable insights for advancing reliable and scalable PCM&#8208;based photonic systems.








Abstract
Advancements in nanofabrication processes have propelled nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) beyond storage&#8208;class applications. They are now making headway in fields such as photonic integrated circuits (PIC), free&#8208;space optics, and plasmonics. This shift is owed to their distinct electrical, optical, and thermal properties between their different atomic structures, which can be reversibly switched through thermal stimuli. However, the reliability of PCM&#8208;based optical components is not yet on par with that of storage&#8208;class devices. This is in part due to the challenges in maintaining a uniform temperature distribution across the PCM volume during phase transformation, which is essential to mitigate stress and element segregation as the device size exceeds a few micrometers. Understanding thermal transport in PCM&#8208;based devices is thus crucial as it dictates not only the durability but also the performance and power consumption of these devices. This article reviews recent advances in the development of PCM&#8208;based photonic devices from a thermal transport perspective and explores potential avenues to enhance device reliability. The aim is to provide insights into how PCM&#8208;based technologies can evolve beyond storage&#8208;class applications, maintain their functionality, and achieve longer&#160;lifetimes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in nanofabrication processes have propelled nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) beyond storage-class applications. They are now making headway in fields such as photonic integrated circuits (PIC), free-space optics, and plasmonics. This shift is owed to their distinct electrical, optical, and thermal properties between their different atomic structures, which can be reversibly switched through thermal stimuli. However, the reliability of PCM-based optical components is not yet on par with that of storage-class devices. This is in part due to the challenges in maintaining a uniform temperature distribution across the PCM volume during phase transformation, which is essential to mitigate stress and element segregation as the device size exceeds a few micrometers. Understanding thermal transport in PCM-based devices is thus crucial as it dictates not only the durability but also the performance and power consumption of these devices. This article reviews recent advances in the development of PCM-based photonic devices from a thermal transport perspective and explores potential avenues to enhance device reliability. The aim is to provide insights into how PCM-based technologies can evolve beyond storage-class applications, maintain their functionality, and achieve longer&#160;lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These key properties have significantly promoted the rapid development of chiral nanomaterials in bioengineering and medicine. In this review, the basic principles of constructing chiral nanomaterials along with the latest progress in research are comprehensively summarized. Then, the application of chiral nanomaterials for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is systematically described. In addition, the significant potential and broad prospects of chiral nanomaterials in the treatment of NDDs are highlighted from several aspects, including the disaggregation of neurofibrils, the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, regulation of the microbial&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis, the elimination of senescent cells, and the promotion of directed differentiation in neural stem cells.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the development trend, solvation structures, interfacial chemistry, and latest progress of lithium salts are discussed from the perspectives of coordination chemistry and structural design, hoping to provide inspiration for the on&#8208;demand design/customization of lithium salts, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Lithium batteries, favored for their high energy density and long lifespan, are staples in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and aerospace. A key component, Li salts, aids lithium ion migration and electrode protection, significantly impacting battery performance. Developing an ideal Li salt, balancing stability, solubility, dissociation, solvation, and eco&#8208;friendliness, remains challenging. Given the scarcity of relevant reviews, it is endeavored here to present a novel perspective on Li salt chemistry, offering a concise roadmap for future designs and innovations. It is delved into the trends, opportunities, design principles, and evaluation methodologies related to Li salt chemistry, with a particular emphasis on organic anionic compositions. Furthermore, the latest and most representative organic Li salts from their intrinsic structure and coordination chemistry, highlighting their unique features and contributions are organized and presented. Finally, a visionary outlook is articulated for this field, exploring avenues, such as customizing Li salts for specific applications, synthesizing Li salts on demand, and discussing the potential of F&#8208;free Li salts alongside with their electrochemical window challenges. Here it is served as a strategic compass, addressing the shortcomings of existing reviews and guiding the design of functionalized Li salts.

         <title>Evolution and Reconstruction of Air&#8208;Electrode Surface Composition in Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells: Mechanisms, Impacts on Catalytic Performance, and Optimization Strategies &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the surface evolution and reconstruction of reversible protonic ceramic cell (R&#8208;PCC) air&#8208;electrodes. It begins by analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to surface evolutions, followed by a summary of factors that lead to electrochemical performance degradation, emphasizing on both the negative and positive effects of water. Additionally, recent advances in enhancing electrode surface activity are presented.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (R&#8208;PCCs) are at the forefront of electrochemical conversion devices, capable of reversibly and efficiently converting chemical energy into electricity at intermediate temperatures (350&#8211;700&#160;&#176;C) with zero carbon emissions. However, slow surface catalytic reactions at the air&#8208;electrode often hinder their performance and durability. The electrode surface is not merely an extension of the bulk structure, equilibrium reconstruction can lead to significantly different crystal&#8208;plane terminations and morphologies, which are influenced by material's intrinsic properties and external reaction conditions. Understanding electrode surface evolution at elevated temperatures in water&#8208;containing, oxidative atmospheres presents significant importance. In this review, a comprehensive summary of recent processes in applying advanced characterization techniques for high&#8208;temperature electrode surfaces is provided, exploring the correlations between surface evolution and performance fluctuations by examining the structural evolution and reconstruction of various air&#8208;electrode surfaces associated with degradation and activation phenomena, offering insights into their impact on electrode performance. Furthermore, reported strategies and recent advances in enhancing the electrochemical performance of R&#8208;PCCs through engineering air&#8208;electrode surfaces is discussed. This review offers valuable insights into surface evolution in R&#8208;PCCs and is expected to guide future developments in high&#8208;temperature catalysis, solid&#8208;state ionics, and energy materials.

         <title>Monolithic Multiparameter Terahertz Nano/Microdetector Based on Plasmon Polariton Atomic Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) is proposed to construct a monolithic multifunctional detector. With a footprint one&#8208;tenth the incident wavelength, the detector offers benchmarking intensity&#8208;, frequency&#8208;, and polarization&#8208;sensitive detection, rapid response, and sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution, all operating at room temperature across 0.22 to 4.24 THz. The unique advantages of the PPAC detector make it promising for high&#8208;resolution imaging and polarization&#8208;coded communication.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) signals are crucial for ultrawideband communication and high&#8208;resolution radar, demanding miniaturized detectors that can simultaneously measure multiple parameters such as intensity, frequency, polarization, and phase. Traditional detectors fail to meet these needs. To address this, we introduce a plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) detector based on monolayer graphene, offering a multifunctional, monolithic, and miniaturized solution. With a footprint only one&#8208;tenth the size of the incoming wavelength, the PPAC achieves benchmark performance in intensity&#8208;, frequency&#8208;, and polarization&#8208;sensitive detection. Operating at room temperature across 0.22&#8211;4.24 THz, it delivers sub&#8208;diffraction detection resolution and high&#8208;speed operation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application in free&#8208;space THz polarization&#8208;coded communication and stealth imaging for physical property analysis. The unique design of PPAC enables strong absorption with weak signal detection, within a structure just 10&#8722;5 times the excitation wavelength in thickness, an accomplishment beyond current technologies. By simultaneously resolving intensity, frequency, and polarization, this detector can replace multiple single&#8208;function devices, providing a compact and efficient solution for next&#8208;generation ultrawideband communication and high&#8208;resolution radar systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Defect Regulated G&#8208;C3N4 for Piezoelectric Catalytic Tumor Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a surface photoetching strategy is employed to introduce surface nitrogen vacancies on the repaired carbon nitride, significantly improving its piezoelectric performance. This defect&#8208;engineered carbon nitride, serving as an excellent sonosensitizer, can temporally and spatially generate reactive oxygen species within tumor cells under ultrasound stimulation, thereby achieving effective piezoelectric catalytic therapy for cancer.








Abstract
Piezoelectric catalysis for tumor treatment is an emerging method for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS).

This defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheet can effectively generate ROS in tumor cells and induce tumor cell apoptosis under US stimulation.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a surface photoetching strategy is employed to introduce surface nitrogen vacancies on the repaired carbon nitride, significantly improving its piezoelectric performance. This defect-engineered carbon nitride, serving as an excellent sonosensitizer, can temporally and spatially generate reactive oxygen species within tumor cells under ultrasound stimulation, thereby achieving effective piezoelectric catalytic therapy for cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezoelectric catalysis for tumor treatment is an emerging method for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the development and optimization of piezoelectric catalytic nanomaterials remain the major challenge. Herein, by regulating the internal and surface defects of graphene phase carbon nitride (defect-engineered g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), its piezoelectricity and sonocatalytic performance is enhanced, thus achieving efficient tumor treatment. By reducing bulk defects, the charges excited by ultrasound (US) within the defect-engineered g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can migrate more rapidly to the material surface, thereby enhancing their participation in redox reactions. Increasing surface defects not only introduce more active sites on the surface of defect-engineered g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; but also enhance the asymmetry of the defect-engineered g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; structure, resulting in excellent piezoelectric properties.

         <title>Rapid, Sensitive Detection of Protein Biomarkers in Minimally&#8208;Processed Blood Products with a Monolithic Sandwich Immunoassay Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8216;Instant FLISA&#8217; (fluorophore&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor enables rapid quantification of protein biomarkers at picomolar concentrations within 15&#160;min in undiluted serum and plasma. This is achieved with the &#8216;monolithic dual&#8208;antibody clamp&#8217; reagent that tightly binds to the target molecule and produces a fluorescence signal which is detected with an optical fiber probe.








Abstract
For more than fifty years, the enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serves as the gold standard for protein biomarker detection. However, conventional ELISA requires considerable sample preparation including reagent addition, incubation, and washing steps, limiting its usefulness at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. In this work, the &#8220;instant ELISA&#8221; (fluorophore&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor that can measure protein biomarkers in the picomolar range within 15&#160;min in undiluted plasma or serum with no sample preparation is described. The sensor leverages a synthetic reagent termed the &#8220;monolithic dual&#8208;antibody clamp&#8221; (MDAC) which preserves the specificity, sensitivity, and generalizability of an ELISA, but produces a fluorescence signal as two surface&#8208;tethered antibodies form a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; by binding to two distinct epitopes on the target. As exemplars, picomolar quantification of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)&#8208;1, the latter of which is a useful prognostic indicator of cytokine release syndrome in patient plasma samples during chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy are demonstrated.

         <title>A Functionalized 3D&#8208;Printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; Inspired by Marine Sponges to Recruit and Rejuvenate Autologous BMSCs in Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by marine sponges, the E7 peptide and EXOs&#8208;functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; with a hierarchical porous structure specifically recruits and rejuvenates autologous BMSCs, and enhances cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by down&#8208;regulating senescent&#8208;related genes and decreasing SASP factor release, thereby promoting the repair of osteoporotic bone defects and achieving robust multi&#8208;stage osseointegration.








Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mass and high fracture risk, challenges orthopedic implant design. Conventional 3D&#8208;printed Ti6Al4V scaffolds are mechanically robust but suffer from poor bone regeneration in osteoporotic patients due to stress shielding and cellular senescence. In this study, a functionalized 3D&#8208;printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; is developed, aiming to adapt to the mechanical microenvironment of osteoporosis, effectively recruit and support the adhesion and growth of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), while rejuvenating senescent cells for improved bone regeneration. Inspired by marine sponges, the processing accuracy limitations of selective laser melting (SLM) technology is broke through innovatively constructing a hierarchical porous structure with macropores and micropores nested within each other. Results demonstrate that the unique hierarchical porous scaffold reduces the elastic modulus, facilitates blood penetration, and enhances cell adhesion and growth. Further surface functionalization with E7 peptides and exosomes promotes the attraction and rejuvenation of BMSCs and boosts migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo, the functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; accelerates bone repair in osteoporotic rats, while delaying surrounding bone loss, enabling robust multi&#8208;stage osseointegration. This innovation advances 3D&#8208;printed regenerative implants for osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of Red&#8208;Emitting Quantum Dots for Efficient and Stable Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a reliable and easily controllable approach is provided to prepare over 0.5&#8208;kilogram colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which feature&#160;high fluorescence quantum yields of over 90%, and afford their light&#8208;emitting diodes with high efficiency, high brightness, and long operation stability.








Abstract
It is known that large&#8208;scale synthesis of emitters affords colloidal quantum dot (CQD) materials with a great opportunity toward the mass production of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) based commercial electronic products. Herein, an unprecedented example of scalable CQD (&gt; 0.5 kilogram) is achieved by using a core/shell structure of CdZnSe/ZnSeS/CdZnS, in which CdZnSe, ZnSeS, and CdZnS alloys are used as the inner core, transition layer and outermost shell, respectively. It exhibits a high fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;90%), a robust excited state, and a fast radiative transition rate. The investigation of morphology and surface state reveals the possible reasons for such excellent optical properties, which include uniform size distribution, no undesired byproducts, and high defect tolerance. The QLEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of over 21%, a high luminance of over 9.5&#215;104&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a long lifetime of over 1.0&#215;106 h, corresponding to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance among the QLEDs based on the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs. Therefore, it is believed that an efficient and reliable strategy is provided toward the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs, which can be used as emitters in the QLEDs&#8208;based commercial electronic devices and make the mass production of these products a reality.

         <title>Exceptional Cooling Capacity of LiGd0.1Yb0.9F4 at Sub&#8208;Kelvin Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;free LiYb0.9Gd0.1F4 represents prominent &#8722;&#916;Sm values among the representative sub&#8208;Kelvin&#8208;temperature refrigerants throughout the whole temperature range from 0.1 to 1 K, demonstrating an exceptional specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&#8722;3 T&#8722;1 at 300 mK in a self&#8208;built two&#8208;stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.








Abstract
Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which utilizes the magnetocaloric effect of magnetic refrigerants, stands as the sole cooling technology capable of achieving sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures efficiently and reliably without relying on scarce 3He resources or gravity. However, current sub&#8208;Kelvin magnetic refrigerants encounter challenges such as structural instability in vacuum or under mild heating, along with small magnetic entropy change (&#8722;&#916;Sm) values, which significantly limit their practical applications. Here a water&#8208;free magnetic refrigerant, LiGd0.1Yb0.9F4 is reported, prepared by introducing Li&#8314; ions to reduce the dipolar interactions between Gd3+ ions and/or Yb3+ ions. Notably, this refrigerant possesses a magnetic ordering temperature of 85 mK, while its experimental &#8722;&#916;Sm reaches up to 136 mJ cm&#8722;3 K&#8722;1 (0.68 K and 2 T), more than three times the theoretical value of CrK(SO4)2&#183;12H2O. Significantly, this refrigerant not only cools the test sample to temperatures as low as 160 mK but also achieves a specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&#8722;3 T&#8722;1 at 300 mK. Remarkably, the specific cooling capacity at 300 mK is more than double that of commercial CrK(SO4)2&#183;12H2O, representing one of the most notable values reported among all known magnetic refrigerants operating at sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures.

&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values among the representative sub-Kelvin-temperature refrigerants throughout the whole temperature range from 0.1 to 1 K, demonstrating an exceptional specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 mK in a self-built two-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which utilizes the magnetocaloric effect of magnetic refrigerants, stands as the sole cooling technology capable of achieving sub-Kelvin temperatures efficiently and reliably without relying on scarce &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He resources or gravity. However, current sub-Kelvin magnetic refrigerants encounter challenges such as structural instability in vacuum or under mild heating, along with small magnetic entropy change (&#8722;&#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) values, which significantly limit their practical applications. Here a water-free magnetic refrigerant, LiGd&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Yb&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is reported, prepared by introducing Li&#8314; ions to reduce the dipolar interactions between Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and/or Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Notably, this refrigerant possesses a magnetic ordering temperature of 85 mK, while its experimental &#8722;&#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; reaches up to 136 mJ cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.68 K and 2 T), more than three times the theoretical value of CrK(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Significantly, this refrigerant not only cools the test sample to temperatures as low as 160 mK but also achieves a specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 mK. Remarkably, the specific cooling capacity at 300 mK is more than double that of commercial CrK(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, representing one of the most notable values reported among all known magnetic refrigerants operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Atomic Mechanisms of Single&#8208;Crystalline MoS2 Epitaxy on Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study conclusively resolves the atomic configuration at the growth interface, unveiling a periodic molecular MoO3 layer van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al&#8208;terminated sapphire (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3)&#160;surface. This structure, distinct from prior reports, aligns perfectly with experimental data and enhances the interaction between molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and &#945;&#8208;Al2O3. By introducing unique 1&#8208;fold symmetry, it enables unidirectional MoS2 alignment, offering fresh insights into interfacial atomic engineering.








Abstract
The epitaxial growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322;)&#160;on sapphire&#160;substrates enables the formation of single&#8208;crystalline monolayer MoS&#8322; with exceptional material properties on a wafer scale. Despite this achievement, the underlying growth mechanisms remain a subject of debate. The epitaxial interface is critical for understanding these mechanisms, yet its exact atomic configuration has previously been unclear. In this study, a monolayer single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; grown on a sapphire substrate is analyzed, decisively visualizing the atomic structure of the epitaxial interface and elucidating its role in epitaxial growth from an atomic perspective. The findings reveal that the interface consists of a periodic molecular MoO3 interlayer, van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al&#8208;terminated sapphire surface. Additionally, it is discovered that MoO3 coverage enhances surface interactions and introduces a unique atomic arrangement with 1&#8208;fold symmetry at the sapphire surface, thereby facilitating the unidirectional alignment of MoS&#8322;. This discovery provides valuable insights into the growth mechanisms leading to single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; formation, and suggests pathways for quantitatively monitoring and controlling growth dynamics, for the improvement of material quality and process repeatability, applicable for single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; or potentially other transition metal dichalcogenides epitaxially grown on sapphire.

         <title>Tuning Absorption State and Intermolecular Potential of Organic Semiconductors for Narrowband Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti&#8208;interference in the photodetection process. For constructing strong anti&#8208;interference photodetectors, a general strategy is developed to achieve narrowband ultraviolet&#8208;responsive organic semiconductors by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductor.








Abstract
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti&#8208;interference of the organic photodetectors, which are pursued for a long time but have not yet been resolved in the UV band. Herein, a feasible strategy is developed to realize narrowband UV response by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductors. The as&#8208;designed non&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor molecule, 2,5&#8208;diphenylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (2,5&#8208;DPTT), exhibits narrowband absorption by fully suppressing the charge transfer state absorption. Simultaneously, the intermolecular potential is significantly enhanced (to &#8776;90 KJ mol&#8722;1) by modulating the molecular planarity. Consequently, the UV photodetector based on 2,5&#8208;DPTT achieves excellent narrowband response at 310 nm wavelength and a record&#8208;breaking photosensitivity (P = 1.21 &#215; 106) in the deep UV range. In the demonstration application of flame alarm, the flame detector based on 2,5&#8208;DPTT single crystal exhibits excellent anti&#8208;interference capability. This work provides the inspiration for designing narrowband responsive organic semiconductors and building up multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Lyotropic Liquid Crystal Mediated Assembly of Donor Polymers Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the concentration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of conjugated polymers, uncovering lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in several donor polymers. The extent of this self&#8208;assembly process, determined by the solvent drying dynamics during blade coating, gives distinct film morphologies that significantly impact the device efficiency and stability, offering a framework for optimizing performance through precise control of coating conditions and polymer assembly.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers can undergo complex, concentration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly during solution processing, yet little is known about its impact on film morphology and device performance of organic solar cells. Herein, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) mediated assembly across multiple conjugated polymers is reported, which generally gives rise to improved device performance of blade&#8208;coated non&#8208;fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. Using D18 as a model system, the formation mechanism of LLC is unveiled employing solution X&#8208;ray scattering and microscopic imaging tools: D18 first aggregates into semicrystalline nanofibers, then assemble into achiral nematic LLC which goes through symmetry breaking to yield a chiral twist&#8208;bent LLC. The assembly pathway is driven by increasing solution concentration &#8211; a common driving force during evaporative assembly relevant to scalable manufacturing. This assembly pathway can be largely modulated by coating regimes to give 1) lyotropic liquid crystalline assembly in the evaporation regime and 2) random fiber aggregation pathway in the Landau&#8211;Levich regime. The chiral liquid crystalline assembly pathway resulted in films with crystallinity 2.63 times that of films from the random fiber aggregation pathway, significantly enhancing the T80 lifetime by 50&#8208;fold. The generality of LLC&#8208;mediated assembly and enhanced device performance is further validated using polythiophene and quinoxaline&#8208;based donor polymers.

         <title>Anisotropic Electrical Transport in Mechanically Responsive Silver&#8208;Coated Microparticle&#8208;Gel Composites for Flowable Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimuli&#8208;responsive soft semiconducting composite is prepared with silver microspheres dispersed in a viscoelastic copolymer gel. With an electric field arcing parallel to the applied flow rate, an enhanced electrical signal is detected due to microstructural particle alignment in the same direction that promotes electron transport.








Abstract
Soft materials with reversible electrical and mechanical properties are critical for the development of advanced bioelectronics that can distinguish between different rates of applied strain and eliminate performance degradation over many cycles. However, the current paradigm in mechano&#8208;electronic devices involves measuring changes in electrical current based on the accumulation of strain within a conductive material that alters the geometry through which electrons flow. Attempts have been made to incorporate soft materials like liquid metals and concentrated solutions of conjugated polymers and salts to overcome materials degradation but are limited in their ability to detect changes in the rate of the applied strain. Herein, the anisotropic electrical performance of a soft semiconducting composite prepared with silver&#8208;coated microspheres dispersed within a swollen copolymer gel is demonstrated. This composite exhibits an electrical response proportional to the magnitude of the applied shear force to enable a rate&#8208;of&#8208;strain dependent conductivity. Furthermore, a 100&#8208;fold increase in the conductivity of the composite is observed when the electric field is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This improvement in the electrical response can be attributed to the enhanced alignment of microspheres in viscoelastic media and can be leveraged in the development of mechanically responsive electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A stimuli-responsive soft semiconducting composite is prepared with silver microspheres dispersed in a viscoelastic copolymer gel. With an electric field arcing parallel to the applied flow rate, an enhanced electrical signal is detected due to microstructural particle alignment in the same direction that promotes electron transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft materials with reversible electrical and mechanical properties are critical for the development of advanced bioelectronics that can distinguish between different rates of applied strain and eliminate performance degradation over many cycles. However, the current paradigm in mechano-electronic devices involves measuring changes in electrical current based on the accumulation of strain within a conductive material that alters the geometry through which electrons flow. Attempts have been made to incorporate soft materials like liquid metals and concentrated solutions of conjugated polymers and salts to overcome materials degradation but are limited in their ability to detect changes in the rate of the applied strain. Herein, the anisotropic electrical performance of a soft semiconducting composite prepared with silver-coated microspheres dispersed within a swollen copolymer gel is demonstrated. This composite exhibits an electrical response proportional to the magnitude of the applied shear force to enable a rate-of-strain dependent conductivity. Furthermore, a 100-fold increase in the conductivity of the composite is observed when the electric field is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This improvement in the electrical response can be attributed to the enhanced alignment of microspheres in viscoelastic media and can be leveraged in the development of mechanically responsive electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as Photocatalyst for Smart Conversion Between Photooxidation and Photoreduction and H2O2 Production in Full pH Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF) possessing environment&#8208;initiated switchable photocatalytic reduction and oxidation and H2O2 production, is constructed by engineering at a molecular level and the local phenol&#8208;quinone structure of the skeletal building blocks. As a smart photocatalyst, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF based on phenol&#8208;quinone transformation can convert into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF intelligently with a trigger, and vice versa.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with intelligent self&#8208;adjusting is of great significance in the photocatalytic process. Herein, a smart covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF) with a phenol&#8208;quinone conversion structure with pH changes is constructed for photooxidation,&#160;photoreduction, and H2O2 production. As a smart photocatalyst, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF can convert into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF intelligently with a trigger including solution pH, and vice versa. The reconstruction of phenol&#8208;quinone conversion not only significantly alters the morphologies and the specific surface areas of the COF, but also leads to an entirely change in the band energy and charge distribution to influence photoelectric properties. As a result, under acidic conditions, Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF converts into Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF automatically and can photoreduce high concentration Cr(VI) to Cr(III) efficiently. Under neutral conditions, the superoxide anions (&#183;O2&#8722;) initiate the Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF reconstruction into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF to accelerate photooxidation to degrade high&#8208;concentration TC. Under alkaline conditions, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF converts into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF, can effectively photosynthesize H2O2 (1525 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 at &#955; &gt; 420 nm) in the absence of any sacrificial reagents, and reveal the strong alkalinity lower the energy barrier of hydrogen extraction from H2O and clarify active sites for H2O2 production. This work provides a new strategy for developing smart photocatalysts and fulfill the application across the full pH environment.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Fluorescence Through Plasmon Resonance and Interfacial Charge Transfer by AgNC@AgAux Core&#8211;Shell Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>

The work reports on the synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs with a core&#8211;shell heterostructure. This novel structure exhibits significantly enhanced photoluminescence, which can be attributed to electron injection and a strong local electric field induced by surface plasmons.








Abstract
Bimetallic core&#8211;shell quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism and optoelectronic devices. The synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs of core&#8211;shell heterostructure are reported. Significantly enhanced photoluminescence emission on these heterostructures is observed. These enhancements are attributed to electron injection and the surface plasmon&#8208;induced strong local electric field, which are observed through time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectra and density functional theory confirms the electron injection from the Ag core to the AgAux shell. On the other hand, the plasmon resonance of the AgNC@AgAux QDs has been studied by finite&#8208;element method analysis and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectra. There are 94.06 times fluorescence enhancement and 32.40 times quantum yield improvement of oxygen content correlation compared to AgAu3 QDs. It shows a perfect correlation coefficient of 98.85% for the detection of heavy metal Cu2+ ions. Such Bimetallic core&#8211;shell heterostructures have great potential for future optoelectronic devices, optical imaging, and other energy&#8208;environmental applications.

         <title>Observation of Large Low&#8208;Field Magnetoresistance in Layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO Films at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work obtains a notable low&#8208;field magnetoresistance (1.2 &#215; 103%, 0.1 T) in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films at a high temperature range (190&#8211;240 K). Such layered phases raise the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains. The achievement of such notable LFMR at high temperatures will advance the magnetic devices.








Abstract
Large low&#8208;field magnetoresistance (LFMR, &lt;&#160;1 T), related to the spin&#8208;disorder scattering or spin&#8208;polarized tunneling at boundaries of polycrystalline manganates, holds considerable promise for the development of low&#8208;power and ultrafast magnetic devices. However, achieving significant LFMR&#160;typically necessitates extremely low temperatures due to diminishing spin polarization as temperature rises. To address this challenge, one strategy involves incorporating Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structures (ABO3)n:AO, which are layered derivatives of perovskite structure capable of potentially inducing heightened magnetic fluctuations at higher temperatures. Here, a remarkable LFMR of up to 1.0&#215;103% is obtained in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films with a high and wide temperature range (190&#8211;240 K). This finding underlines that the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO (n = 1) structure show a complex magnetic structure above TMI of perovskite NdNiO3, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains, raising the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures. Furthermore, applying a low magnetic field (&lt;0.1 T) near TMI effectively mitigates the disruption of antiferromagnetic order structures at boundaries, then a higher temperature is required to break the inhibition of ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. The results contribute significantly to the advancement of magnetic devices capable of achieving substantial LFMR at room temperature.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Endogenous Antibody Recruitment Strategy for Innate Immune&#8208;Mediated Killing of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) can redirect endogenous antibodies to target cancer cells and induce killing; however, currently, they are limited by low antibody affinity. This study presents a novel ARM strategy using lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding the common allergen Der p 2, fused to a membrane anchor, enabling high&#8208;affinity antibody recruitment. In mice, this approach reduces pulmonary metastasis, with neutrophils as key effector cells. This mRNA LNP strategy offers promise for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are bivalent molecules that contain a cell&#8208;binding domain and an antibody&#8208;binding domain. ARMs are designed to redirect circulating endogenous antibodies from the bloodstream to the surface of cancer cells and thereby trigger innate immune&#8208;mediated killing of the latter. The current generation of clinically explored ARMs relies on synthetic small molecule haptens. However, their effectiveness is restricted by the low affinity of the available repertoire of endogenous anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. Utilizing endogenous high&#8208;affinity allergen&#8208;specific antibodies could potentially circumvent this issue. In this study, a genetically encoded antibody&#8208;recruiting strategy that utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding the house dust mite allergen Der p 2, fused to a cell membrane anchor, to induce cell surface display and enable the recruitment of anti&#8208;Der p 2 antibodies, is presented. Der p 2 mRNA LNP&#8208;treated cancer cells cause greatly reduced pulmonary tumor burden in Der p 2 immunized mice, compared to untreated cells or nonimmunized mice. Reduced tumor growth is dependent on circulating antibodies, and neutrophils are identified as a key immune cell subset recognizing and eliminating Der p 2&#8208;displaying cancer cells. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of mRNA LNPs as a powerful tool for generating a genetically encoded ARM strategy, with potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.

     alt="A Genetically Encoded Endogenous Antibody Recruitment Strategy for Innate Immune-Mediated Killing of Cancer Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs) can redirect endogenous antibodies to target cancer cells and induce killing; however, currently, they are limited by low antibody affinity. This study presents a novel ARM strategy using lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding the common allergen Der p 2, fused to a membrane anchor, enabling high-affinity antibody recruitment. In mice, this approach reduces pulmonary metastasis, with neutrophils as key effector cells. This mRNA LNP strategy offers promise for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs) are bivalent molecules that contain a cell-binding domain and an antibody-binding domain. ARMs are designed to redirect circulating endogenous antibodies from the bloodstream to the surface of cancer cells and thereby trigger innate immune-mediated killing of the latter. The current generation of clinically explored ARMs relies on synthetic small molecule haptens. However, their effectiveness is restricted by the low affinity of the available repertoire of endogenous anti-hapten antibodies. Utilizing endogenous high-affinity allergen-specific antibodies could potentially circumvent this issue. In this study, a genetically encoded antibody-recruiting strategy that utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding the house dust mite allergen Der p 2, fused to a cell membrane anchor, to induce cell surface display and enable the recruitment of anti-Der p 2 antibodies, is presented. Der p 2 mRNA LNP-treated cancer cells cause greatly reduced pulmonary tumor burden in Der p 2 immunized mice, compared to untreated cells or nonimmunized mice. Reduced tumor growth is dependent on circulating antibodies, and neutrophils are identified as a key immune cell subset recognizing and eliminating Der p 2-displaying cancer cells. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of mRNA LNPs as a powerful tool for generating a genetically encoded ARM strategy, with potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Current&#8208;Driven Magnetization Switching for Superconducting Diode Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting magnetization diode effect in stacking superconductors with ferromagnetic materials heterostructures, enabling robust magnetization readout through superconductivity with an ideally infinite on/off ratio, is demonstrated. Combining spin&#8211;orbit torque for current&#8208;driven magnetization switching, this work bridges superconductivity and spintronics, offering scalable, energy&#8208;efficient memory solutions with simplified design and improved performance.









Abstract
Stacking superconductors (SC) with ferromagnetic materials (FM) significantly impact superconductivity, enabling the emergence of spin&#8208;triplet states and topological superconductivity. The tuning of superconductivity in SC&#8208;FM heterostructure is also reflected in the recently discovered superconducting diode effect, characterized by nonreciprocal electric transport when time and inversion symmetries are broken. Notably, in SC&#8208;FM systems, a time reversal operation reverses both current and magnetization, leading to the conceptualization of superconducting magnetization diode effect (SMDE). In this variant, while the current direction remains fixed, the critical currents shall be different when reversing the magnetization. Here, the existence of SMDE in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures is demonstrated. SMDE uniquely maps magnetization states onto superconductivity by setting the read current between two critical currents for the positive and negative magnetization directions, respectively. Thus, the magnetization states can be read by measuring the superconductivity, while the writing process is accomplished by manipulating magnetization states through current&#8208;driven spin&#8211;orbit torque to switch the superconductivity. The proposed superconducting diode magnetoresistance in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures with an ideally infinite on/off ratio resolves the limitations of tunneling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunneling junctions, thereby contributing to the advancement of superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Modular Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based Organ&#8208;Specific Targeting (POST) Lipid Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient RNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a library of lipopeptide&#8208;based organ&#8208;specific targeting (POST) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The POST LNPs, screened in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate high efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. Structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis indicates that various lipid systems prefer specific lipopeptide structures for enhanced RNA delivery efficacy.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with highly efficient and specific extrahepatic targeting abilities are promising in gene delivery, and the lipopeptides (LPs) with excellent designability and functionality are expected to empower the construction of functional LNPs. This study aims to develop highly efficient ionizable components that accurately match different targeting lipid systems through the modular design of LPs. Based on this, a lipopeptide&#8208;based organ&#8208;specific targeting (POST) LNP screening strategy is constructed, in which lysine&#8208;histidine&#8208;based lipopeptides (KH&#8208;LPs) are designed as highly efficient ionizable components. The optimal KH&#8208;LP LNP screened in vitro shows excellent siRNA/mRNA transfecting ability in various hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cell lines. Compared to the classic LNPs, the POST LNPs screened in vivo achieve even higher (or at least comparable) efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. The structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) proves that the modular regulation of LP structures can accurately provide the optimal ionizable components for different targeting lipid systems, demonstrating the potential of this strategy in developing efficient and selective targeting systems, which is expected to open up more possibilities for gene therapy.

         <title>Synthesis and Light&#8208;Matter Interaction of Low&#8208;Dimension Ordered&#8211;Disordered Layered Semiconductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 2D alloy with in&#8208;plane nano&#8208;segregations exhibits unique excitonic properties, enhanced valley polarization (up to 50%), and high implied open&#8208;circuit voltage (up to 1130 mV). These features highlight its potential for advanced optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Well&#8208;structured and ordered 2D layered semiconducting materials have excellent optical properties but limited advanced optoelectronic applications in their natural state. Altering their natural arrangement, through artificial heterostructures, strain and pressure engineering, chemical doping, intercalation, and alloying, can impart them with unusual optical properties and potentially enhance their performance in various applications. Among these approaches, alloying is generally difficult to control and disrupts the well&#8208;ordered homophilic crystal phase of these 2D crystals, albeit with the capability to control materials as thin as a single atomic layer. In this work, the synthesis of a low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered layered 2D alloy of Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 with clearly ordered in&#8208;plane segregations of nano&#8208;sized islands of individual MoSe2 and WSe2 across the material surface is reported. The optical analysis of this ordered&#8211;disordered layered Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 reveals unique interfacial and interlayer coupling physics, such as the co&#8208;existence of intralayer (interfacial) and interlayer excitons and enhanced valley polarization of up to 50%, which is traditionally absent in ordered MoSe2, WSe2, or their heterostructures. Furthermore, the structure exhibits implies open circuit voltage (up to 1130&#160;mV), signifying its excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage potential if employed in photovoltaic devices. Overall, the reported low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered semiconductor alloys can be useful in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Broadband THz Modulation via Solid&#8208;State Organic Electrochemical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic electrochemical device achieving over 90% reversible THz modulation via a conducting polymer is developed. The device demonstrates stability under repeated and continuous voltage switching and can operate in either depletion or accumulation modes. This device introduces a new option for future THz wireless sensing and communications, and application scope for organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;Terahertz and Terahertz bands play a critical role&#160;in next&#8208;generation wireless communication and sensing technologies, thanks to the large amount of available bandwidth in this spectral regime. While long&#8208;wavelength (microwave to mm&#8208;Wave) and short&#8208;wavelength (near&#8208;infrared to ultraviolet) devices are well&#8208;established and studied, the sub&#8208;THz to THz regime remains relatively underexplored and underutilized. Traditional approaches used in the aforementioned spectral regions are more difficult to replicate in the THz band, leading to the need for the development of novel devices and structures that can manipulate THz radiation effectively. Herein a novel organic, solid&#8208;state electrochemical device is presented, capable of achieving modulation depths of over 90% from &#8776;500&#160;nm of a conducting polymer that switches conductivity over a large dynamic range upon application of an electronically controllable external bias. The stability of such devices under long&#8208;term, repeated voltage switching, as well as continuous biasing at a single voltage, is also explored. Switching stabilities and long&#8208;term bias stabilities are achieved over two days for both use cases. Additionally, both depletion mode (always &#8220;ON&#8221;) and accumulation mode (always &#8220;OFF&#8221;) operation are demonstrated. These results suggest applications of organic electrochemical THz modulators in large area and flexible implementations.

         <title>Hopping&#8208;Phase Ion Bridge Enables Fast Li+ Transport in Functional Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hopping phase ion bridge (HPIB) is introduced into the interface between polyvinylidene fluoride and functionalized Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12; high&#8208;throughput ion transporter (HTIT&#8208;37) is constructed. The self&#8208;adsorption of HPIB at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface effectively enhances the interfacial Li+ transport kinetics and suppresses the formation of lithium dendrites. It provides a more valuable option for the next generation of high energy density solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) containing Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is widely regarded as leading candidate for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries due to its exceptional ionic conductivity and environmental stability. However, Li2CO3 and LiOH layers at LLZTO surface greatly hinder Li+ transport between LLZTO&#8208;polymer and the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Herein, the surface of LLZTO is boronized to obtain functionalized LLZTO, and its conversion mechanism is clarified. By dissolving the crystal structure of cellulose to obtain hopping&#8208;phase ion bridge (HPIB), which release the Li+ transport activity of its oxygen&#8208;containing polar functional group (&#9472;OH, &#9472;O&#9472;). Therefore, a high&#8208;throughput ion transporter (HTIT&#8208;37) with high ion transfer number (0.86) is prepared by introducing the HPIB into functionalized LLZTO and polyvinylidene fluoride interface by intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction, and it is demonstrated that the HPIB acts as a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the Li+ across this heterogeneous interface. Moreover, the HPIB is found to self&#8208;adsorb on the SEI surface, leading to fast Li+ transport kinetics at anode&#8211;CPE interface. Thus, the lifespan of Li|HTIT&#8208;37|Li is over 8000 h, and the critical current density exceeds 2.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li and Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li battery remains stable with the HPIB&#8208;enhanced electrode process, proving the application potential of LLZTO&#8208;based CPE in high energy density SSLMB.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Perfect Absorbers Based on Biomimetic Metamaterials with Dual Coupling Gradient Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel concept for broadband absorption metamaterial design&#8212;Metal&#8211;Insulator&#8211;Metal metamaterials with gradient resonators (GR&#8208;MIMs). The GR&#8208;MIMs absorber couples gradient resonant cavities in both nanoscale and microscale dimensions. By converting &#8220;resonance points&#8221; into &#8220;resonance bands,&#8221; the GR&#8208;MIMs absorber achieves 93% ultra&#8208;broadband high absorption (0.2&#8211;5 &#181;m) at a thickness of 200 nm.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband metamaterial absorbers can achieve near&#8208;perfect absorption of omnidirectional electromagnetic waves, crucial for light utilization and manipulation. Traditional ultra&#8208;broadband metamaterials rely on the superposition of different resonator units either in the plane or in perpendicular directions to broaden absorption peaks. However, this approach is subject to quantity restrictions and complicates the fabrication process. This study introduces a novel concept for broadband absorption metamaterial design&#8212;Metal&#8211;Insulator&#8211;Metal metamaterials with gradient resonators (GR&#8208;MIMs) to surpass limitations in quantity and fabrication. The GR&#8208;MIMs absorber features gradient resonant cavities in both nanoscale and microscale dimensions, each with continuous resonance points. By converting &#8220;resonance points&#8221; into &#8220;resonance bands&#8221; and perfectly coupling the two gradient resonators, the GR&#8208;MIMs absorber with a thickness of only 200&#160;nm demonstrates 93% ultra&#8208;broadband high absorption across the UV, visible, near&#8208;infrared, and mid&#8208;infrared spectra (0.2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m). Moreover, the solar spectrum absorption rate of the GR&#8208;MIMs absorber can reach 94.5%, offering broad prospects for applications in solar energy utilization. The design of gradient resonators provides a new approach for the development of ultra&#8208;broadband metamaterials and photothermal conversion metamaterials.

         <title>Robust Nanoscale Anode Protective Layers toward Fast&#8208;Charge High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust protective layer is constructed by reactive molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSAg). Benefiting from the in situ reaction between PSSAg side&#8208;chains and Li metal, the modified Li anode integrates abundant Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains, robust GO backbones, and Li&#8211;Ag solid solution, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, remarkable mechanical strength and homogeneous Li deposition.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and structurally homogeneous lithium&#8211;electrolyte interfacial layers are crucial in stabilizing lithium (Li) anodes for practical Li metal batteries. Herein, an ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust artificial protective layer is constructed with reactive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular brushes as building blocks. The artificial protective layer can in situ react with underlying Li metal to produce a nanoscale poly(lithium styrenesulfonate)&#8208;grafted graphene oxide (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) layer on the outermost surface and an infinite Li&#8211;Ag solid solution in the anode. The nanoscale GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi layer well integrates a large number of single Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains and 2D robust GO backbones, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion as well as remarkable mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the simultaneously formed Li&#8211;Ag solid solution is beneficial for rapid Li transport in the anode to reduce the Li nucleation barrier and facilitate homogeneous deposition of Li. With such artificial protective layers, a prototype pouch cell with a thin Li metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and a high&#8208;loading cathode (21.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive cycle life of over 350 cycles with 69% capacity retention under harsh conditions. Remarkably, ultrahigh charging power density of 456&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 325&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 can be simultaneously achieved in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.

         <title>Activating Halogen Circulation Enables Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a halide&#8208;healing halogen circulation strategy to suppress Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ion migration in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Consequently, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive 23.25% efficiency with a minimal open&#8208;circuit voltage loss of 0.39 V in a 1.67 eV bandgap device. A tandem solar cell further demonstrates a high Voc of 1.99 V and an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.








Abstract
Developing strategies to manage ion&#8208;migration&#8208;induced phase segregation in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, maintaining continuous suppression of phase segregation from the film crystallization process to device operation remains a significant challenge. The present study demonstrates an efficient strategy of activating halogen circulation in WBG perovskite by using halogen circulation agents (HCA) of N&#8208;halosuccinimide molecules as the sustainable stabilizers, in order to achieve dynamic halogen equilibrium within the precursor solution and perovskite film, which blocks the migration path of Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions both in crystallization and aging of WBG perovskites. Attempts on in situ dynamic monitoring of halide migration visually verified the enhanced stability by activated halogen circulation in both WBG films and devices. Consequently, present work achieves a champion efficiency up to 23.25% with a low Voc loss of 0.39&#160;V in the 1.67&#8208;eV&#8208;bandgap device, and the HCA&#8208;based devices can maintain 88% and 93% of their initial efficiencies over 1000&#160;h under continuous illumination and 2500&#160;h at 85 &#176;C in N2 atmosphere, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a halide-healing halogen circulation strategy to suppress Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion migration in wide-bandgap perovskites. Consequently, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive 23.25% efficiency with a minimal open-circuit voltage loss of 0.39 V in a 1.67 eV bandgap device. A tandem solar cell further demonstrates a high Voc of 1.99 V and an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing strategies to manage ion-migration-induced phase segregation in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites is crucial for achieving high-performance perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, maintaining continuous suppression of phase segregation from the film crystallization process to device operation remains a significant challenge. The present study demonstrates an efficient strategy of activating halogen circulation in WBG perovskite by using halogen circulation agents (HCA) of N-halosuccinimide molecules as the sustainable stabilizers, in order to achieve dynamic halogen equilibrium within the precursor solution and perovskite film, which blocks the migration path of Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions both in crystallization and aging of WBG perovskites. Attempts on in situ dynamic monitoring of halide migration visually verified the enhanced stability by activated halogen circulation in both WBG films and devices. Consequently, present work achieves a champion efficiency up to 23.25% with a low &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; loss of 0.39&#160;V in the 1.67-eV-bandgap device, and the HCA-based devices can maintain 88% and 93% of their initial efficiencies over 1000&#160;h under continuous illumination and 2500&#160;h at 85 &#176;C in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere, respectively. As a proof of concept, the perovskite/silicon monolithic TSCs are fabricated to demonstrate a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.99&#160;V and a high power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Osteomimix: A Multidimensional Biomimetic Cascade Strategy for Bone Defect Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy for bone regeneration is developed by emulating the biomineralization cascade, hierarchical structure, and biological functions of bone tissue. The resulting composite, named &#8220;Osteomimix&#8221;, exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell&#8208;free way, while fosters vascularized bone formation in a cell&#8208;dependent way.








Abstract
Despite advancements in biomimetic mineralization techniques, the repair of large&#8208;scale bone defects remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the bone formation process, a multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy is developed by replicating the biomineralization cascade, emulating the hierarchical structure of bone, and biomimicking its biological functions for efficient bone regeneration. This strategy involves the photocrosslinking of sodium methacrylate carboxymethyl cellulose&#8208;stabilized amorphous magnesium&#8208;calcium phosphate with methacrylate&#8208;modified type I collagen to create a self&#8208;mineralizing hydrogel. The hydrogel is then integrated with either naturally derived or synthetic oriented bulk scaffolds. The resulting composite, named Osteomimix, provides excellent mechanical support and can be customized for irregular bone defects using CAD/CAM technology. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, this work finds that Osteomimix exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell&#8208;free environment, while modulating immune responses and promoting vascularized bone formation in a cell&#8208;dependent manner. Built on bone&#8208;specific insights, this strategy achieves biomimicry across temporal, spatial, and functional dimensions, facilitating the seamless integration of artificial constructs with the natural tissue repair dynamics.

         <title>Weak Near&#8208;Infrared Light Visualization Enabled by Smart Multifunctional Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>

A smart NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon upconversion (UC) device with integrated photodetection (PD) and electroluminescence functionalities is developed. The device continuously monitors incident light intensity through its PD function and compensates for UC emission under low light conditions to achieve clear visualization of weak NIR light.








Abstract
Visualizing weak NIR&#160;light is critical for sensing, imaging, and communication, but remains challenging due to inefficient detection and upconversion (UC) mechanisms. A smart NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon&#8208;UC organic optoelectronic device is reported that integrates photodetection, light&#8208;emitting diode (LED), and photovoltaic capabilities to enable clear visualization of weak NIR light. The programmable device has continuous photodetection monitoring of the incident NIR intensity. When the incident intensity falls below a preset threshold, the LED function is automatically triggered to compensate for the UC emission, amplifying the visualization. The smart multifunctional device uses a carefully designed ternary bulk heterojunction sensitizer doped with rubrene:DBP as the emitter. It demonstrates high UC efficiency (&gt;1.5%) for upconversion from 808 to 608&#160;nm, allowing NIR visualization without external power under strong illumination. It also shows excellent NIR photodetection with photoresponsivity of 0.35&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 800&#160;nm and specific detectivity reaching 10&#185;2&#8211;10&#185;3 Jones, enabling sensitive detection under low&#8208;light conditions. It also exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage (0.9 V) and luminance exceeding 1200&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 5 V, ensuring energy&#8208;efficient light compensation. Furthermore, it achieves &gt;10% power conversion efficiency, enabling sustainable self&#8208;powered operation. This multifunctional, high&#8208;performance system offers great potential in sensing, energy harvesting, and display technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Descriptor Tailoring: Rational Solvent Molecule Tuning Enables High&#8208;Voltage Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;descriptor approach is developed to design high&#8208;voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta&#8208;stable surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual&#8208;descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN&#8208;based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut&#8208;off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta&#8208;stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual&#8208;descriptor&#8208;guided design opens a new avenue for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries is believed.

         <title>A Wireless Operated Flexible Bioelectronic Microneedle Patch for Actively Controlled Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible bioelectronic microneedle patch (FBMP) for actively controlled transdermal drug delivery. Integrating a flexible circuit board, gallium&#8208;indium heating film, and dual&#8208;layer microneedles, the FBMP enables real&#8208;time control via smartphone Bluetooth. It can control different drug release rates on demand, offering great potential for precise, personalized drug delivery for a variety of medical applications.









Abstract
Precise control over drug release rates is critical for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and maintaining stable drug levels. While microneedles (MNs) offer a promising approach for transdermal drug delivery, conventional passive&#8208;response systems often lack adaptability across diverse drugs and disease models, limiting their versatility. Here, this work presents a flexible bioelectronic microneedle patch (FBMP) that integrates flexible electronics for actively controlled transdermal delivery. The FBMP incorporates a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB), a eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) heating film, and dual&#8208;layer microneedles with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) core and polycaprolactone (PCL) shell. This configuration allows real&#8208;time adjustment of the thermal response rate via smartphone&#8208;controlled Bluetooth, achieving rapid drug release within 2 min or sustained release over 10 h. In various animal models, the FBMP demonstrate versatility in delivering multiple drug types, optimizing efficacy, and minimizing side effects for both acute and chronic conditions. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, universal electronic microneedle platform with significant potential to advance precision and personalized medicine by enabling customizable, actively controlled drug release.

Here, this work presents a flexible bioelectronic microneedle patch (FBMP) that integrates flexible electronics for actively controlled transdermal delivery. The FBMP incorporates a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB), a eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) heating film, and dual-layer microneedles with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) core and polycaprolactone (PCL) shell. This configuration allows real-time adjustment of the thermal response rate via smartphone-controlled Bluetooth, achieving rapid drug release within 2 min or sustained release over 10 h. In various animal models, the FBMP demonstrate versatility in delivering multiple drug types, optimizing efficacy, and minimizing side effects for both acute and chronic conditions. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, universal electronic microneedle platform with significant potential to advance precision and personalized medicine by enabling customizable, actively controlled drug release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid Catholyte with Regulated Interphase Redox for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy for regulating the redox behavior of the solid catholyte toward dynamic interphase stability, which in turn stabilizes the main reaction of solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox. Leveraging this stabilizing mechanism, a newly formulated Li6.2P0.8W0.2S5I electrolyte with high reversibility is developed to build high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (ASSLSB) is considered one of the ultimate next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to the expected low cost, high safety, and high specific energy. The high&#8208;conductivity and low&#8208;modulus sulfide electrolytes hold promise as electrolytes in the cathode (i.e., solid catholytes) for ASSLSBs, but their parasitic decomposition and reactions over cycling lead to degradation of the active material&#8722;catholyte interphases and hence limited cycling life. Herein a strategy is described to stabilize the ASSLSBs by regulating the interphase redox reversibility of the sulfide catholyte, which is validated on a new sulfide electrolyte formulated as Li6+xP1&#8722;xWxS5I (LPWSI). The experiments show that the presence of mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting WS2 boosts the Li4P2S7&#8722;to&#8722;Li3PS4 reaction in the interphase, which prevents irreversible accumulation of impeding P2S74&#8722; and thereby improves the catholyte's interphase stability. With the LPWSI catholyte, the ambient&#8208;temperature ASSLSB exhibits stable cycling sustaining 92.2% capacity over 400 cycles at C/5 with an initial areal capacity of 1.95&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cells demonstrate excellent high&#8208;rate stability over 1000 cycles at rates of 1C and 2C. The reported strategy contributes to reshaping the understanding of how solid catholyte can function in composite cathodes and provides new guidelines for designing catholyte for high&#8208;capacity conversion&#8208;based electrodes that involve complex evolution of interphases.

         <title>A DNA Nanopatch&#8208;Bacteriophage System Targeting Streptococcus Gallolyticus for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment and Colorectal Cancer Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work constructs a novel DNA nanopatch (DNPs)&#8208;modified bacteriophages (P&#8208;Sg) therapeutic platform (DNPs@P) for precise, gut&#8208;targeted therapy that potently reduces inflammation and prevents the colonic inflammation&#8208;to&#8208;carcinoma transition. To protect DNPs@P from the harsh gastrointestinal environment, this work encapsulates them with an enteric polymer acrylic resin (L100&#8208;55) (DNPs@P&#8208;L). Upon oral administration, the L100&#8208;55, ensures their safe passage through the stomach and release in the intestine. Then P&#8208;Sg target and lyse pathogenic bacteria at inflammatory sites, delivering DNPs precisely to affected regions, which can scavenge ROS in the inflammatory site.








Abstract
Persistent inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) colonization, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer progression via the Sg&#8208;activated cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) pathway and &#946;&#8208;catenin upregulation. This study presents Sg&#8208;specific bacteriophages modified with DNA nanopatches (DNPs@P) designed to treat IBD and prevent Sg&#8208;induced malignancy. The DNPs are composed of DNA origami nanosheets and phage capture strands. The DNPs scavenge reactive oxygen species, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the phages while targeting and lysing pathogenic bacteria. Coating with an enteric polymer, DNPs@P ensures effective delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate significant restoration of colonic length, reduced inflammation, and improved gut microbiota diversity compared with current clinical treatments. Additionally, DNPs@P effectively prevents colonic tumourigenesis in mouse models. This approach presents a promising strategy for treating gastrointestinal diseases by remodeling the gut microenvironment, addressing a critical gap in current therapies.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework &#8211; Ruthenium Oxide Hybrids for Highly Active Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework adlayer is constructed to precisely tailor the orientation of interfacial water molecule to stabilize the transition state for intermediates adsorption/desorption, optimizing the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis performance.









Abstract
The controlled formation of a functional adlayer at the catalyst&#8208;water interface is a highly challenging yet potentially powerful strategy to accelerate proton transfer and deprotonation for ultimately improving the performance of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). In this study, the synthesis of robust vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possessing high proton conductivities is reported, which are subsequently hybridized with ruthenium dioxide yielding high&#8208;performance anodic catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ spectroscopic measurements corroborated by theoretical calculations reveal that the assembled hydrogen bonds formed between COFs and adsorbed oxo&#8208;intermediates effectively orient interfacial water molecules, stabilizing the transition states for intermediate formation of OER. This determines a decrease in the energy barriers of proton transfer and deprotonation, resulting in exceptional acidic OER performance. When integrated into a PEMWE device, the system achieves a record current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at only 1.54 V cell voltage, with a long&#8208;term stability exceeding 180 h at industrial&#8208;level 200 mA cm&#8722;2. The approach relying on the self&#8208;assembly of an oriented hydrogen&#8208;bonded adlayer highlights the disruptive potential of COFs with customizable structures and multifunctional sites for advancing PEMWE technologies.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Oxychlorides as Promoters of Ruthenium Toward High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lamellar rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are innovatively used as promoters for ruthenium (Ru)&#160;as alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. The [RE2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively, which endows Ru surface with a high density of electrons, thus accelerating the hydroxyl peeling process.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments is vital for hydrogen production, owing to the extra water dissociation and hydroxyl desorption steps. Here, rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are proposed as innovative promoters for ruthenium as HER electrocatalyst in alkali. The lamellar structure of REOCl with weakly bond [Cl] layers can facilitate the formation of an internal electric field that enhances interphase charge transfer. Taking ruthenium/ neodymium oxychloride (Ru/NdOCl) composites as a case study, sub &#8776;4&#160;nm Ru nanoparticles are successfully embedded into NdOCl crystals through a rapid self&#8208;exothermic process, and the highly&#8208;coupled Ru&#8722;Cl/O&#8722;Nd interfaces are observed as metallic Ru particles with the edge of the NdOCl lamellar layers, where the [Nd2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively. The enhanced charge transfer between REOCl and Ru makes the highly&#8208;coupled Ru/REOCl catalysts show better electrocatalytic activity than both the benchmark Pt and Ru catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. This work will encourage more novel promoters for electrocatalysis and other emerging technologies.

The enhanced charge transfer between REOCl and Ru makes the highly-coupled Ru/REOCl catalysts show better electrocatalytic activity than both the benchmark Pt and Ru catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. This work will encourage more novel promoters for electrocatalysis and other emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst with Functional Separation Properties for Efficient pH Universal Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate into value&#8208;added NH3 not only facilitates wastewater denitrification but also promotes nitrogen circulation. The hierarchical carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst with multi&#8208;topological defect&#8208;induced active sites in graphene sheets/outside carbon layer and the pristine carbon nanotubes as the conductive core achieves high activity and durability for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate in a wide pH range.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (eNO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) across varying pH is of great significance for the treatment of practical wastewater containing nitrate. However, developing highly active and stable catalysts that function effectively in a wide pH range remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a hierarchical carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst (C&#8208;MFEC) of winged carbon coaxial nanocables (W&#8208;CCNs, in situ generated graphene nanosheets and outside carbon layer with abundant topological defects from pristine carbon nanotubes, CNTs), is prepared through moderate oxidation of CNTs and the subsequent introduction of topological defects. The W&#8208;CCNs feature functional separation properties, with an inner core of pristine CNTs that facilitates efficient charge transfer, while the outer shell is composed of in situ generated graphene nanosheets and carbon layers enriched with topological defects characterized by distinct carbon atom configurations, which play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the dissociation of water, and the N&#9472;H bond formation. This innovative design enables the C&#8208;MFEC to exhibit outstanding performance for eNO3&#8722;RR, operating efficiently with the NH3 yield rates of 49.5, 75.3, and 88.1&#160;g h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Such performance metrics not only outshine C&#8208;MFECs but also rival or surpass those of certain metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Stretchable and Permeable Liquid Metal Micromeshes Featuring Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance Through In Situ Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes are presented, characterized by strain&#8208;insensitive resistance for potential applications in textile electronics. These micromeshes are produced by spin&#8208;coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and then subjecting them to several stretching cycles. The considerable transformation in their microstructure alters the deformation mode during stretching, thereby effectively minimizing fluctuations in resistance.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals hold promises for applications in stretchable electronics and beyond. However, these materials often encounter notable resistance increases during stretching and have negligible permeability to gases and liquids. This study presents an in situ structural transformation mechanism to create stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance. These micromeshes are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and subjecting them to several stretching cycles. Consequently, the micromeshes transform from a smooth finish to wrinkled textures due to the growth in their oxide nanoskins. The distinct microstructure alters the stretching&#8208;relaxing mode to folding&#8208;unfolding, thereby minimizing fluctuations in resistance. The practical significance of this development is demonstrated through the fabrication of wearable heaters and LED matrices using transformed liquid metal micromeshes. Moreover, when integrated into Janus textiles featuring unidirectional water transport, these micromesh conductors act as sensing electrodes capable of acquiring high&#8208;fidelity biopotentials, even during intense sweating. These advancements highlight the capability of ambient air as a powerful reactive environment for tailoring the properties of microscale liquid metals.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Organic Spintronic Devices with Wide Range Magnetocurrent Tuning and Multifunctionality via Electro&#8208;Optical Compensation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large, tunable room&#8208;temperature magnetocurrent (MC) are crucial for advancing spintronic technologies. This study introduces an electro&#8208;optical compensation strategy in organic semiconductor devices, achieving exceptionally high MC values of +13&#160;200% and &#8722;10&#160;600%. Leveraging this, a multifunctional device is activated, serving as the high&#8208;sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic, etc.








Abstract
In spintronics, devices exhibiting large, widely tunable magnetocurrent (MC) values at room temperature are particularly appealing due to their potential in advanced sensing, data storage, and multifunctional technologies. Organic semiconductors (OSCs), with their rich and unique spin&#8208;dependent and (opto&#8208;)electronic properties, hold significant promise for realizing such devices. However, current organic devices are constrained by limited design strategies, yielding MC values typically confined to tens of percent, thereby restricting their potential for multifunctional applications. Here, this study introduces an electro&#8208;optical compensation strategy to modulate MC values, which synergistically integrates and manages the interplays among carrier transport, spin&#8208;dependent reactions, and photogenerated carrier dynamics in OSCs&#8208;based devices. This approach achieves ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature MC values of +13&#160;200% and &#8722;10&#160;600% in the designed devices, with continuous and precise tunability over this range&#8212;marking a breakthrough in organic spintronic devices. Building on this achievement, by integrating multiple controllable parameters&#8212;light, bias, magnetic field, and mechanical flexibility&#8212;into a single device, a flexible, room&#8208;temperature, multifunctional device is activated, functioning as the high&#8208;sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic, etc. These findings open an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional devices with broad implications for future spintronic&#8208;related technologies.

         <title>A Rolling Light&#8208;Driven Pneumatic Soft Actuator Based on Liquid&#8211;Gas Phase Change</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8211;gas phase&#8208;changing pneumatic actuator driven by optical light is introduced. By precisely controlling the light spot using a magnifying glass, the fiber actuator rolls on a horizontal plane in daylight. With an annular design, the actuator achieved vertical crawling under a fixed visible light source. It also demonstrates promising potential for load propulsion in forward movement. 








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven wireless actuators provide obvious advantages for remote control. However, traditional double&#8208;layer actuators are restricted to the thin film deformation mode when undertaking complex tasks. Here, an actuator is proposed that employs thermal strain and local photothermal effects induced by low boiling point liquids to generate asymmetry along the fiber axis, thereby causing elastic deformation of the fiber. Under continuous irradiation, the sustained elastic deformation results in dynamic frustration within the fiber, creating torque around its axis. Based on this principle, the fiber actuator fabricated in this study enables rolling translation, while the ring actuator achieves simultaneous rolling and lifting motion for object manipulation. Continuous rolling under light eliminates the need for complex light manipulation. This new movement method offers an insight for various application scenarios.

         <title>Carbon Surface Chemistry: Benchmark for the Analysis of Oxygen Functionalities on Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable benchmark for qualitative and quantitative analysis of oxygen functional groups on carbon surface is established by in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. And the dynamic evolution of carbon surface reveals the special flame&#8208;retardant effect and anchor metal ability of oxygen functionalities on carbon materials. These findings strengthen the understanding of carbon surface chemistry from an atomic perspective.








Abstract
The explicit roles of the hardly avoidable oxygen species on carbon materials in various fields remain contentious due to the limitations of characterization techniques, which lead to a lack of fundamental understanding of carbon surface chemistry. This study delves exhaustively into the comprehension of the features of different oxygen&#8208;modified carbons through the dynamic evolution of surficial oxygen functional groups. Significant differences of thermal stability and electronic properties among various oxygen species are elucidated via in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, providing a reliable benchmark for identifying oxygen functional groups on carbon materials. The chemical properties of the carbon materials are simultaneously investigated to show the influence of the oxygen functional groups on carbon structures, redox stability, and scalable metal adsorption. These findings not only consider the common misconception that oxygen species produced under various conditions possess identical properties but also raise awareness of understanding carbon surface chemistry in the atomic level.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Self&#8208;Discharge Capability of Zn&#8208;Halogen Batteries Through an Entrapment&#8208;Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis Strategy Built Upon Separator</title>

The mechanisms of glass fiber (GF) and Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs&#8208;modified glass fiber separator (named as ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF) work in zinc&#8208;halogen batteries. The Mn&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom sites are responsible for adsorption, while the Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs are responsible for catalysis. The polyiodide can be rapidly captured and further transformed into I&#8208; before it reaches zinc anodes through this effective ZnMn&#8208;NC modified layer.









Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries (Zn&#8208;I2/Br2) suffer from grievous self&#8208;discharge behavior, resulting in irreversible loss of active cathode material and severe corrosion of zinc anode, which ultimately leads to rapid battery failure. Herein, an entrapment&#8208;adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategy is reported, leveraging Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs&#8208;modified glass fiber separator (designated as ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF), to effectively mitigate the self&#8208;discharge phenomenon. The in situ Raman and UV experiments, along with theoretical calculations, confirmed the single&#8208;atom Mn sites are responsible for polyiodides adsorption, while Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs facilitated the conversion of reaction intermediates. As a result, the utilization rate of cathode active species is enhanced through this ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF separator. The fully charged Zn&#8208;I2 battery assembled with ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF maintained a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 90.1% after being left for 120 h, as well as a capacity retention rate of 95.3% after 30000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g&#8722;1. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;Br2 battery designed with ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF separator can withstand more serious self&#8208;discharge problems of bromine species, with an average discharge voltage platform of 1.75 V at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The self&#8208;discharge problem of aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries is significantly suppressed by this entrapment&#8208;adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategy, which can serve as a crucial reference for the advancement of high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition Stabilizes Nanocrystals, Enabling Reliably High&#8208;Performance Quantum Dot LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al&#8322;O&#8323; on ZnMgO nanocrystals eliminates aging&#8208;induced performance variability in quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs). This scalable passivation strategy suppresses nanocrystal ripening and passivates surface traps, achieving reproducible 17% external quantum efficiency, a tenfold increase in device operational stability, and consistent performance sustained over 39 weeks.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) with stable high efficiencies are crucial for next&#8208;generation displays. However, uncontrollable aging, where efficiency initially increases during storage (positive aging) but is entirely lost upon extended aging (negative aging), hinders further device development. It is uncovered that it is chemical changes to nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) that give rise to positive aging, their drift in structure and morphology leading to transiently improved charge injection balance. Using grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is found that ZnMgO NCs undergo size&#8208;focusing ripening during aging, improving size uniformity and creating a smoother energy landscape. Electron&#8208;only device measurements reveal a sevenfold reduction in trap states, indicating enhanced surface passivation of ZnMgO. These insights, combined with density functional theory calculations of ZnMgO surface binding, inspire an atomic layer deposition (ALD) strategy with Al&#8322;O&#8323; to permanently suppress surface traps and inhibit NC growth, effectively eliminating aging&#8208;induced efficiency loss. This ALD&#8208;engineered ZnMgO ETL enables reproducible external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17% across 30 batches of LEDs with a T60 of 60 h at an initial luminance of 4500 cd m&#8722;2, representing a 1.6&#8208;fold increase in EQE and a tenfold improvement in operating stability compared to control devices.

         <title>An Integrated Modular Vaccination System for Spatiotemporally Separated Perioperative Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatiotemporal segmentation immunotherapy strategy uses modular microneedles to modulate paradoxical postoperative immunization microenvironments. The modular microneedles load a personalized antitumor vaccine and demonstrate broad antitumor activities in postoperative immunotherapy, reducing recurrence and the incidence of perioperative wound complications.








Abstract
The perioperative period is crucial for determining postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Various factors in postoperative lesions can diminish the therapeutic effect of conventional chemoradiotherapy, while emerging immunotherapy is restricted. The combination use of inflammatory inhibitors during treatment is also controversial. Here, a modular microneedle prepared from engineered keratin proteins is reported, which spatially and temporally differentiates the microenvironment of immune cell activation required for immunotherapy from that of wound healing. The recombinant keratin&#8208;84&#8208;T&#8208;based needle root layer, mainly retained in the epidermis, facilitated dendritic cell recruitment to achieve maximum antigen presentation of loaded vaccines. Meanwhile, the recombinant keratin&#8208;81&#8208;1A&#945;&#8208;based needle tip layer, located within the dermis, rapidly mitigated inflammatory&#160;responses while promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Unlike simply mixing immunotherapy and wound&#160;treatment, this spatiotemporal segmentation approach maximized the efficacy of immune therapeutics while promoting wound healing, making it suitable for application throughout the perioperative period.

         <title>Manipulating Aggregation Kinetics toward Efficient All&#8208;Printed Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acceptor BTP&#8208;Cy, featuring cyclohexyl side chains, is synthesized to control molecular aggregation state in solution. Compared to molecules containing benzene and undecyl side chains, BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based active layer exhibits suitable solubility and molecular aggregation size, leading to an optimal liquid precursor film length and film morphology. Consequently, all&#8208;printed 23.6 cm2 BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based modules achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.2%.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;printed organic solar cells (OSCs) remain inferior to those of spin&#8208;coated devices, primarily due to morphological variations within the bulk heterojunction processed via diverse coating/printing techniques. Herein, cyclohexyl is introduced as outer side chains to formulate a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BTP&#8208;Cy, aimed at modulating the molecular aggregation in solution and subsequent film formation kinetics during printing. Investigations demonstrate that BTP&#8208;Cy molecule with cyclohexyl side chains exhibits enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, optimal solution aggregation size, and favorable phase separation. Consequently, PB3:FTCC&#8208;Br:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based OSCs achieve remarkable PCEs of 20.2% and 19.5% via spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating, respectively. Furthermore, a 23.6 cm2 module exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 16.7%. This study offers a fresh perspective on tailoring the film formation kinetics of photoactive materials during printing through molecular design, paving a novel path to enhance the efficiency of all&#8208;printed OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The acceptor BTP-Cy, featuring cyclohexyl side chains, is synthesized to control molecular aggregation state in solution. Compared to molecules containing benzene and undecyl side chains, BTP-Cy-based active layer exhibits suitable solubility and molecular aggregation size, leading to an optimal liquid precursor film length and film morphology. Consequently, all-printed 23.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; BTP-Cy-based modules achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.2%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-printed organic solar cells (OSCs) remain inferior to those of spin-coated devices, primarily due to morphological variations within the bulk heterojunction processed via diverse coating/printing techniques. Herein, cyclohexyl is introduced as outer side chains to formulate a non-fullerene acceptor, BTP-Cy, aimed at modulating the molecular aggregation in solution and subsequent film formation kinetics during printing. Investigations demonstrate that BTP-Cy molecule with cyclohexyl side chains exhibits enhanced intermolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking, optimal solution aggregation size, and favorable phase separation. Consequently, PB3:FTCC-Br:BTP-Cy-based OSCs achieve remarkable PCEs of 20.2% and 19.5% via spin-coating and blade-coating, respectively. Furthermore, a 23.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; module exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 16.7%. This study offers a fresh perspective on tailoring the film formation kinetics of photoactive materials during printing through molecular design, paving a novel path to enhance the efficiency of all-printed OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Biomass Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ultralong biomass room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) doped systems with phosphorescence quantum up to 32.8%, lifetime up to 4.65 s, and multi&#8208;stimulus response through multiple interactions between host biomass macrocycle and guest is reported. The RTP performance of biomass macrocycle doped systems far exceeds biomass systems ever reported and compares favorably with highly effective polymer systems.








Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, high&#8208;performance organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with stimulus&#8208;responsive properties presents a significant and enticing yet formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy to confining boric acid&#8208;based compounds into biomass macrocycle &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin through multiple interactions is developed, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance and multicolor OURTP doped systems. The synergistic effects of strong hydrogen bonding, C&#9472;O&#9472;B covalent cross&#8208;linking, and host&#8211;guest encapsulation significantly suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, culminating in an extraordinary lifetime and excellent phosphorescence quantum yield of 4.65 s and 32.8%, respectively, which are far superior to reported biomass RTP materials. Additionally, merging biomass macrocycle with phosphors contributes to multiple stimulus responses, overcoming the inherent limitations of degradation and recycling of organic RTP compounds, and dynamically modulating RTP signals through multiple&#8208;stimulus responses, achieving the integration of multifunctional dynamic data processing techniques. This work will provide a direction for new environmentally friendly and potentially commercially available stimulus&#8208;responsive OURTP materials.

         <title>Incompatible Geometry Regulation of Nanowire Assemblies Enabled Light&#8208;Driven Shape Morphing and Motions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire assemblies&#8208;induced geometry engineering method is reported to fabricate a photoresponsive liquid crystal actuator with mechanically incompatible geometry, exhibiting a saddle&#8208;like appearance. By regulating the off&#8208;axis director angle and strip width, the configurations of the actuators undergo sharp and periodic transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals, enabling the generation of multi&#8208;modal photo&#8208;driven locomotion with fast velocities and high controllability.








Abstract
Photoresponsive shape&#8208;changing materials have significant applications in miniaturized smart robotics and biomedicine powered in a remote and wireless manner. Existing light&#8208;fuelled soft materials suffer from limited continuous shape manipulation and constrained mobility and locomotive modes. One promising solution is developing a hierarchical structure design approach to integrate rapid, reversible photoactive molecular alignment and mechanically incompatible geometry in a macroscopic system. Here, a nanowire assemblies&#8208;induced geometry engineering method is reported for the fabrication of silver nanowire&#8208;incorporated nematic liquid crystalline elastomers with prominent anisotropic structures at multi&#8208;length scales and incompatible elasticity that show sharp morphological transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals with diverse helical configurations. The engineered composite films can realize complex light&#8208;driven motions including rotating, rolling, and jumping with the controlled directionality and magnitude that are pre&#8208;encoded in their both molecular and macroscopic configurations. Owing to the great controllability of multimodal locomotion, a spiral robot can undertake task&#8208;specific configuration to climb up complex terrains. The complete regulatory relationship among molecular orientation, shape geometry, and light&#8208;driven motions is also established. This study may open an avenue for elaborate design and precise fabrication of novel shape&#8208;morphing materials for future applications in intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Harnessing Amino Acid Modularity for Programmable Function in Covalent Peptide Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent peptide assembly integrates the robustness of covalent bonds with the adaptability of dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions. Systematic amino acid substitution screening yields programmable peptide frameworks, facilitating the advanced engineering of features such as frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architectures, affinity enrichment, stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and signal amplification. This approach revolutionizes multicomponent peptide assembly, offering enhanced complexity, versatility, and multifunctional potential.








Abstract
Covalent peptide assembly leverages robust covalent bonds and dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions to provide enhanced stability and introduce diverse functionalities. Nevertheless, it remains significantly challenging to achieve modular control over the structural diversity and functional complexity while elucidating how specific amino acid sequences contribute to these processes. Here, the systematic encoding of peptide derivative characteristics is demonstrated through amino acid modularity to enable precise control over both the structural diversity and functional complexity in covalent peptide assemblies. By systematically screening single amino acid substitutions in pentapeptides using tyrosine crosslinking, a diverse library of peptide constructs is developed. Each construct is tailored to exhibit distinct properties, including charge repulsion, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, disassembly behavior, and redox responsiveness. The strategic manipulation of sequence composition, both in individual assemblies and combinatorial systems, enables programmable control over the structural diversity and functional complexity. This approach yields various module&#8208;specific functions, including frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architecture formation, affinity enrichment, stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and fluorescence signal amplification. This work establishes a framework for the design of modular peptide materials with programmable functionalities, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation multicomponent peptide assembly technologies characterized by unprecedented complexity and adaptability.

         <title>Unifying Electrochemically&#8208;Driven Multistep Phase Transformations of Rutile TiO2 to Rocksalt Nanograins for Reversible Li+ and Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the insight reason for the Li+ and Na+ storage performance of the rutile phase, which is determined by the electrochemically driven formed rocksalt nanograins. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalations through a solid&#8208;solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, &#8220;mirror&#8208;like&#8221; cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities.








Abstract
Rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2(R)) lacks octahedral vacancies, which is not suitable for Li+ and Na+ intercalation via reversible two&#8208;phase transformations, but it displays promising electrochemical properties. The origins of these electrochemical performances remain largely unclear. Herein, the Li+ and Na+ storage mechanisms of TiO2(R) with grain sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm are systematically investigated. Through revealing the electrochemically&#8208;driven atom rearrangements, nanosize effect and kinetics analysis of TiO2(R) nanograins during repeated cycling with Li+ or Na+, a unified mechanism of electrochemically&#8208;driven multistep rutile&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt phase transformations is demonstrated. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalation through a solid&#8208;solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, &#8220;mirror&#8208;like&#8221; cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities. Whereas, the nanosize effect determines the different Li+ and Na+ storage capacities because of their distinct reaction depths. Remarkably, the TiO2(R)&#8208;10 nm anode in situ turns into rocksalt nanograins after 30 cycles with Na+, which delivers a reversible capacity of &#8776;200 mAh g&#8722;1, high&#8208;rate capability of 97 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000 cycles. The findings provide deep insights into the in situ phase evolutions with boosted electrochemical Li+ or Na+ storage performance.

         <title>Colloidal Ink Engineering for Slot&#8208;Die Processes to Realize Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency, highly stable perovskite solar cells, and minimodules using a slot&#8208;die process based on colloidal inks. By incorporating the antisolvents toluene and chlorobenzene as modulator solvents, a colloidal ink system is formulated with superior rheological properties compared to conventional precursor inks. This colloidal strategy achieves devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon solar cells, but challenges remain in developing perovskite inks and processes suitable for large&#8208;scale production. This study introduces a novel approach using colloidal inks incorporating toluene and chlorobenzene as co&#8208;antisolvents for PSC fabrication via slot&#8208;die process. It is found that colloidal inks that are strategically engineered can significantly improve the rheological properties of perovskite inks, leading to enhanced wettability and high&#8208;quality film formation. The formation of large colloids such as &#945; cubic perovskite, &#948; hexagonal perovskite and transition intermediate phases promotes heterogeneous nucleation and lowers activation energy for crystallization, resulting in superior crystal growth and improved film morphology. Notably, the co&#8208;solvent enhances the FA&#8208;PbI3 binding energy and weakens the dimethyl sulfoxide coordination, which is more thermodynamically favorable for perovskite crystallization. This colloidal strategy yields devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long&#8208;term stability, retaining 77% of initial efficiency over 10115 h. The study demonstrates the scalability of this approach, achieving 20.26% efficiency in lab&#8208;scale minimodules and 19.15% in larger convergence minimodules. These findings provide an understanding of the complex relationship between ink composition, rheological properties, film quality, crystallization kinetics, and device performance.

         <title>&#8220;Pumping&#8221; Trace Cu Impurity out of Zn Foil for Sustainable Aqueous Battery Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper exists as trace impurity in commercial Zn foil and generally gets ignored in terms of its potential for regulating Zn electrodeposition. Herein, it is demonstrated how trace amount of internal Cu atoms can be readily &#8220;pumped&#8221; out, in one step, to get concentrated on Zn foil surface and to further suppress dendritic Zn electrodeposition as a sustainable aqueous battery interface.









Abstract
Dendritic zinc (Zn) electrodeposition presents a significant obstacle to the large&#8208;scale development of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To mitigate this challenge, various interfacial strategies have been employed. However, these approaches often involve the incorporation of foreign materials onto Zn anode surface, resulting in increased material costs and processing complexities, not to mention the compromised interface endurability due to structural and compositional heterogeneity. Realizing that Cu atoms typically exist as trace impurities in commercial Zn, a novel approach is demonstrated that leverages these Cu impurities to create a Cu&#8208;rich surface for effective modulation of Zn electrodeposition. By simply heating commercially available Zn foil with a naturally oxidized surface, not only the internal Cu atoms are thermally activated to become diffusible, their diffusion is also navigated toward the surface via&#160;oxygen attraction. The resulting Cu&#8208;rich surface effectively regulates Zn electrodeposition, comparable to conventional interfacial strategies, yet exhibits superior cycling durability. 3D in situ microscopy confirms that this Cu&#8208;rich surface enables dendrite&#8208;free, compact, and (101)&#8208;oriented Zn electrodeposition, contrasting with the traditional (002)&#8208;oriented dendrite&#8208;suppression mechanism. By transforming trace Cu impurity within Zn foil into a Cu&#8208;rich surface, this work demonstrates a straightforward, cost&#8208;effective and efficient method for controlling Zn electrodeposition.

         <title>Myocardia&#8208;Injected Synergistically Anti&#8208;Apoptotic and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Poly(amino acid) Hydrogel Relieves Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive thermo&#8208;sensitive poly(amino acid) hydrogel is demonstrated to release the therapeutic drug FTY720 in a reactive oxygen species&#8208;controlled manner and achieves a synergistic effect by inhibiting apoptosis and regulating the reperfusion inflammatory microenvironments, thereby reducing ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury and promoting tissue repair, demonstrating significant clinical potential for the treatment of ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury.








Abstract
Reperfusion therapy is the most effective treatment for acute myocardial infarction, but its efficacy is frequently limited by ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI). While antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies have shown significant potential in alleviating IRI, these strategies have not yielded satisfactory clinical outcomes. For that, a thermo&#8208;sensitive myocardial&#8208;injectable poly(amino acid) hydrogel of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)45&#8208;poly(L&#8208;methionine20&#8208;co&#8208;L&#8208;alanine10) (mPEG45&#8208;P(Met20&#8208;co&#8208;Ala10), PMA) loaded with FTY720 (PMA/FTY720) is developed to address IRI through synergistic anti&#8208;apoptotic and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Upon injection into the ischemic myocardium, the PMA aqueous solution undergoes a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel phase transition and gradually degrades in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), releasing FTY720 on demand. PMA acts synergistically with FTY720 to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and modulate pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization toward anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages by clearing ROS, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response and promoting vascular regeneration. In a rat IRI model, PMA/FTY720 reduces the apoptotic cell ratio by 81.8%, increases vascular density by 34.0%, and enhances left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 12.8%. In a rabbit IRI model, the gel&#8208;based sustained release of FTY720 enhanced LVEF by an additional 7.2% compared to individual treatment. In summary, the engineered PMA hydrogel effectively alleviates IRI through synergistic anti&#8208;apoptosis and anti&#8208;inflammation actions, offering valuable clinical potential for treating myocardial IRI.

         <title>Photoinduced Cleavage of Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Chiral Vanadium Trioxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>

Strongly chiral V2O3 NPs with optical responsiveness achieve targeted and precise cleavage of the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein through photoinduction, thereby inhibiting respiratory syncytial virus.








Abstract
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant threat to the health of infants, children, and the elderly, and as of now there is a lack of effective therapeutic drugs. To tackle this challenge, chiral vanadium trioxide nanoparticles (V2O3 NPs) with a particle size of 2.56 &#177; 0.34 nm are successfully synthesized, exhibiting a g&#8208;factor value of 0.048 at 874 nm in terms of circular dichroism. Under 808 nm light irradiation, these chiral V2O3 NPs demonstrated selective cleavage of the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein), effectively blocking its conformational rearrangement and preventing RSV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental analysis revealed that the chiral V2O3 NPs specifically bind to the functional domain spanning from aspartate200 (D200) to asparagine208 (N208) in the primary sequence of the RSV protein. Notably, L&#8208;V2O3 NPs exhibited a higher affinity, which is 4.06 times that of D&#8208;V2O3 NPs and 13.55 times that of DL&#8208;V2O3 NPs. The precise cutting site is located between amino acid residues leucine204 (L204) and proline205 (P205), attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoinduced nanoparticles. In addition, L&#8208;V2O3 NPs inhibited RSV infection by 99.6% in nasal epithelial cells and 99.2% in Vero cells. In the RSV&#8208;infected mouse model, intranasal administration of L&#8208;V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs effectively controlled the viral load in the lungs of mice, reducing it by 92.43%. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of mouse organs and serum biochemical indicators are similar to those of the wild&#8208;type group, indicating the biosafety of L&#8208;V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs. The findings suggest that chiral nanoparticles hold great potential in controlling RSV and provide new directions and ideas for drug development against viruses.

In addition, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs inhibited RSV infection by 99.6% in nasal epithelial cells and 99.2% in Vero cells. In the RSV-infected mouse model, intranasal administration of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs effectively controlled the viral load in the lungs of mice, reducing it by 92.43%. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of mouse organs and serum biochemical indicators are similar to those of the wild-type group, indicating the biosafety of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs. The findings suggest that chiral nanoparticles hold great potential in controlling RSV and provide new directions and ideas for drug development against viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecules to Masterpieces: Bridging Materials Science and the Arts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes the convergence of materials science and art through the creation of self&#8208;assembled block copolymer lamellar thin films with vivid iridescence. These films are applied as coatings on window panels for an architectural installation as well as transformed into porous, structurally colored ceramics. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale engineering in artistic and architectural contexts.








Abstract
Art and materials innovation have always been intertwined, dating back to the earliest human creations. In modern times, however, the increasing specialization of materials science often restricts artists' access to cutting&#8208;edge materials. Here, the materials science aspects of an art&#8208;science collaboration between artist Kimsooja and the Wiesner Lab at Cornell University, are detailed. The project involves the development of a custom&#8208;made iridescent block copolymer coating by means of self&#8208;assembly, originally applied to transparent window panels of a fa&#231;ade for the &#8776;14&#160;m tall art installation: A Needle Woman: Galaxy Is a Memory, Earth is a Souvenir by artist Kimsooja. After several exhibitions in the US and Europe, the installation is now part of the permanent museum collection at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield, UK. Full characterization of the solution blade&#8208;cast coatings show shear aligned, standing up lamellar morphologies that behave as volume&#8208;phase gratings with periodicities between 300 and 400&#160;nm. Coatings are also applied to foldable (origami) paper and converted into iridescent porous ceramic materials. It is hoped this work inspires and informs communities across materials science, the arts, and architecture.

         <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain&#8208;Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable bioelectronics conforming to dynamic body surfaces enable high&#8208;fidelity physiological monitoring but often suffer from motion artifacts. All&#8208;printed strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics are presented using a universal gradient interface (UGI) created via aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing (AMMP). The UGI minimizes local strain changes under 180% stretch, supporting artifact&#8208;free sensors for health monitoring and advancing wearable and implantable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on&#8208;skin devices for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain&#8208;induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here all&#8208;printed super stretchable strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) are reported to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing&#160;technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain&#8208;insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% uniaxial stretch ratio. Various stretchable devices are directly printed on the UGI for on&#8208;skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near&#8208;perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor&#8208;based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal&#8208;based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real&#8208;time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Pumped Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Topological Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled colloidal topological laser with CW room&#8208;temperature pumping is presented, featuring extensive wavelength tunability, ultra&#8208;high polarization, and good temporal stability. Precise control over a single NPL layer thickness allows excellent performance in semiconductor lasers, advancing solution&#8208;processed systems for display technology and modern communication.








Abstract
The field of optoelectronic integrated circuits is actively developing reliable and efficient room&#8208;temperature continuous&#8208;wave (CW) lasers. CW&#8208;pumped lasers combine the economical and simple manufacturing processes of colloidal semiconductor lasers with the efficient and stable output of continuous pumping, enabling them to significantly impact the field of semiconductor lasers. However, development is still severely challenged by limitations such as gain materials and cavity structures. Consequently, as a compromise, most colloidal semiconductor lasers proposed to date have relied on another pulsed laser as the pumping source. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled colloidal topological laser is proposed that benefits from CW pumping at room temperature. By utilizing an interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategy, nanoplatelets (NPLs) are managed to control the collective orientation (face&#8208;down or edge&#8208;up), achieving controlled polarization of amplified spontaneous emission for the first time. Furthermore, precise control over the thickness of a single NPL layer is demonstrated, which enables the laser system to offer extensive wavelength tunability (over 50&#160;nm), ultra&#8208;high polarization (over 95%), and good temporal stability. These metrics signify the optimal performance level of colloidal semiconductor lasers, marking a new era in solution processing systems for the optoelectronic integrated circuit field.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Accessible Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Durable and Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Laminated Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with high density of accessible sites (D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C) is fabricated by a cascade capturing strategy. Systematic structural and electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the high active site density and site utilization enable D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C showcases excellent ORR performance, which is further verified in laminated zinc&#8208;air batteries with remarkable durability and temperature&#8208;adaptive.








Abstract
Designing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high density of accessible sites by improving metal loading and sites utilization is a promising strategy to boost the catalytic activity, but remains challenging. Herein, a high site density (SD) iron SAC (D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C) with 11.8 wt.% Fe&#8208;loading is reported. The in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technique attests that the accessible active SD and site utilization of D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C reach as high as 1.01 &#215; 1021 site g&#8722;1 and 79.8%, respectively. Therefore, D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C demonstrates superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in terms of a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.918 V and turnover frequency of 0.41 e site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The excellent ORR property of D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C is also demonstrated in the liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), which exhibit a high peak power density of 306.1 mW cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 1200 h. Moreover, solid&#8208;state laminated ZABs prepared by presetting an air flow layer show a high specific capacity of 818.8 mA h g&#8722;1, an excellent cycling stability of 520 h, and a wide temperature&#8208;adaptive from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. This work not only offers possibilities by improving metal&#8208;loading and catalytic site utilization for exploring efficient SACs, but also provides strategies for device structure design toward advanced ZABs.

         <title>Zwitterionic Photosensitizer&#8208;Assembled Nanocluster Produces Efficient Photogenerated Radicals via Autoionization for Superior Antibacterial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct Type I photosensitizer nanocluster. Facile intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer within nanocluster forms photosensitizer radical cation and anion via autoionization. These radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient reactive oxygen species, achieving 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA that surpasses the efficacy of commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by 8.8&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds significant promise for antibacterial treatment, with its potential markedly amplified when using Type I photosensitizers (PSs). However, developing Type I PSs remains a significant challenge due to a lack of reliable design strategy. Herein, a Type I PS nanocluster is developed via self&#8208;assembly of zwitterionic small molecule (C3TH) for superior antibacterial PDT in vivo. Mechanism studies demonstrate that unique cross&#8208;arranged C3TH within nanocluster not only shortens intermolecular distance but also inhibits intermolecular electronic&#8208;vibrational coupling, thus facilitating intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer to form PS radical cation and anion via autoionization reaction. Subsequently, these highly oxidizing or reducing PS radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient &#183;OH and O2&#8254;&#183;. As a result, C3TH nanoclusters achieve a 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA at an ultralow dose, surpassing the efficacy of the commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by more than 8.8&#8208;fold. These findings deepen the understanding of Type I PDT, providing a novel strategy for developing Type I PSs.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Structured Antiferroelectric Composite Ceramics for Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 11, March 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;filed simulations, a strategy of controlling the morphology and ordering of Al2O3 fillers in Pb&#8208;based AFE composite ceramics is proposed, aiming to improve its breakdown strength. Significantly improved Eb of 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and ultrahigh Wrec of 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 are achieved in composite ceramics with parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors possessing high power density and ultrashort discharge time are valuable for high&#8208;power energy storage applications. However, achieving high energy storage density remains challenging due to the limited breakdown strength of dielectric ceramics. In this study, inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;field simulations, a strategy of constructing a nacre&#8208;like layered structure is proposed to improve the breakdown strength and energy storage density of the ceramics. This unique structure is formed by controlling the morphology and ordering of high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant fillers in a ceramic matrix. The (Pb0.98La0.02)(Zr0.7Sn0.3)0.995O3&#8208;Al2O3 antiferroelectric composite ceramics, containing 5vol% parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates, demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in breakdown strength from 390 to 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Of particular importance is that an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density of up to 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved, representing a 50% enhancement compared to the pure ceramic (8.7 J cm&#8722;3). The parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates are strongly bound together with the ceramic matrix, effectively blocking charge migration and controlling the breakdown path, thus greatly enhancing the voltage endurance of the composite ceramics. This work provides an innovative approach to designing high&#8208;performance composite ceramics for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Ammonium Ion&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by the Synergy of ORR and NH4+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high&#8208;rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (78 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9369 W kg&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost&#8208;effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco&#8208;friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2&#8722; and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion&#8208;air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 9369 W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12&#160;500 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment&#8208;friendly AIBs.

         <title>TREM2 scFv&#8208;Engineering Escherichia coli Displaying Modulation of Macrophages to Boost Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio&#8208;chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non&#8208;responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti&#8208;TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the &#945;PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Cu&#8208;Mn&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogs for Practical Sodium Ion Cylinder Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective ternary Prussian blue analog is synthesized via structural regulation to achieve the compatibility of high capacity and long lifespan for sodium&#8208;ion batteries within a wide temperature range. Mn and Cu synergistically enhances conductivity, operating voltage, and stability, suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions. This design enables high&#8208;loading 18650&#8208;type cells with exceptional electrochemical performance, supporting grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective cathodes are essential for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have shown great potential as SIB cathodes, but achieving both high capacity and long lifespan remains challenging. In this study, a series of low&#8208;cost ternary PBAs synthesized through structural regulation is presented to simultaneously achieve high capacity, stable cycling performance, and broad temperature adaptability. Among them, CuHCF&#8208;3 demonstrates a specific capacity of 132.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 73.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. In&#8208;depth analyses, using in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations, reveal a highly reversible three&#8208;phase transition (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal) in Na1.96Cu0.45Mn0.55[Fe(CN)6]0.91&#183;&#9633;0.09&#183;2.14H2O (CuHCF&#8208;3), which is driven by synergistic interactions between Mn and Cu. Mn enhances conductivity, increases the operating voltage, and introduces additional redox centers, while Cu mitigates the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions associated with Mn and buffers volume changes during cycling. This structural synergy results in excellent temperature stability across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 55&#160;&#176;C). 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells based on CuHCF&#8208;3 with high loading density achieve 73.54% capacity retention over 850 cycles. This study offers valuable insights for designing durable, high&#8208;capacity electrode materials for SIB energy storage applications.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Oligonucleotide Nanohybrids Designed for Precise Gene Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Revisiting the &#8220;Stick&#8208;Slip&#8221; Process via Magnetism&#8208;Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like device for stick&#8208;slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick&#8208;slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
&#8220;Stick&#8208;slip&#8221; phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich&#8208;type device with deformable ridge&#8208;layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as cosalts, where the Zn-Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much-improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized and Controllable Mineral Salts Crystallization Enabled by Dye Modified Gold Nanorods with Enhanced Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract
Well&#8208;designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of &gt;100&#160;&#176;C under 638&#160;nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs&#8208;doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116&#160;&#176;C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO3 (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO3, and SrCO3 are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as&#8208;prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function&#8208;led photothermal materials.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Oriented Assembly of 2D Metal&#8208;Pyridylporphyrinic Framework to Regulate the Redox Kinetics in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By connecting CoTPyP blocks with transition metal nodes, a class of bimetallic 2D MOFs are designed and synthesized. The prepared CoTPyP&#8208;M MOFs enhanced the utilization of sulfur and smoothed the lithium deposition/stripping process. The central Co sites display strong interactions with sulfur species through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;N bonds, facilitating the cleavage of S&#8722;S bond from both ends and promoting their conversion kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
Developing the highly efficient catalysts is a great challenge for accelerating the redox reactions in Li&#8722;S batteries. Inspired by the single&#8208;atom catalysts and metalloproteins, it makes full use of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts. Herein, a series of 2D metal&#8208;bonded metalloporphyrin MOFs are prepared with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl) cobalt porphyrin (CoTPyP) as building blocks and transition metals (M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as nodes, respectively. The crystalline structures of the bimetallic 2D MOFs are confirmed by UV&#8211;vis spectra and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. According to DFT calculation, the peripheral metal nodes optimize the electronic state of Co in porphyrin core. Especially, CoTPyP&#8208;Mn facilitates the cleavage of S&#8722;S bond from both ends and promotes their conversion kinetics through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;N bonds. The Li&#8722;S cells with CoTPyP&#8208;Mn show the initial specific capacity of 1339&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C. The capacity decay rate is only 0.0442% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C. This work achieves the rational control of the central Co d electron state through the peripheral regulation and enriches the application of MOFs in accelerating the redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Highly Ordered Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Chemically Confined Polyoxometalate Clusters: A Dual&#8208;Functional Electrocatalyst for Efficient H2O2 Synthesis and Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically bonded conductive metal&#8208;organic framework/polyoxometalate composites are synthesized as a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst through a conserved ligand replacement strategy. Excellent performances with a H2O2 production rate of 9.51&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 2, 5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield of 96.8% are achieved in an integrated electrolysis system of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupling with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The design of bifunctional and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that can be used as both cathodes and anodes for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and biomass valorization is attracting increasing attention. Herein, a conserved ligand replacement strategy is developed for the synthesis of highly ordered conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;HITP, HITP = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene) with chemically confined phosphotungstic acid (PW12) nanoclusters in the nanopores. The newly formed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bonds in the resultant Ni&#8208;HITP/PW12 electrocatalysts modulate the electronic structures of both Ni and W sites, which are favorable for cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 production and anodic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to 2, 5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), respectively. In combination with the deliberately retained conductive frameworks and ordered pores, the dual&#8208;functional Ni&#8208;HITP/PW12 composites enable a H2O2 production rate of 9.51&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an FDCA yield of 96.8% at a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/cell voltage of 1.38&#160;V in an integrated 2e&#8722; ORR/HMFOR system, significantly improved than the traditional 2e&#8722; ORR/oxygen evolution reaction system. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and electrocatalytic systems for the green synthesis of valuable chemicals.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an FDCA yield of 96.8% at a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cell voltage of 1.38&#160;V in an integrated 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR/HMFOR system, significantly improved than the traditional 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR/oxygen evolution reaction system. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and electrocatalytic systems for the green synthesis of valuable chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twist&#8208;Angle Controllable Transfer of 2D Materials via Water Vapor Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high&#8208;quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high&#8208;performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high&#8208;quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle&#8208;controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high&#8208;performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of &#8776;199,000&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks Expedite Molecular Triplet Excitons for H2O2 Production Coupled with Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated olefin&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework photocatalyst is developed. The adjacent fluorine atom&#8208;olefinic bond forms p&#8211;&#960; conjugation and expedites triplet excitons for activating O2 to 1O2 while accelerating charge separation, thus leading to high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural photo&#8208;oxidation upgrading.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency production of triplet states in covalent organic framework photocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;selectivity oxygen (O2)&#160;reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, fluorine and partial fluorine atoms are incorporated into an olefin&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework (F&#8208;ol&#8208;COF and HF&#8208;ol&#8208;COF), in which the adjacent fluorine (F) atoms&#8208;olefinic bond forms p&#8208;&#960; conjugation that induces spin&#8208;polarization under irradiation, thus expediting triplet excitons for activating O2 to singlet oxygen (1O2) and contributing to a high H2O2 selectivity (91%). Additionally, the feasibility of coupling H2O2 production with the valorization of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is exhibited. The F&#8208;ol&#8208;COF demonstrates a highly stable H2O2 yield rate of 12558&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;functionalized furan conversion yield of 95%, much higher than the partially fluorinated COF (HF&#8208;ol&#8208;COF) and the non&#8208;fluorinated COF (H&#8208;ol&#8208;COF). Mechanistic studies reveal that F&#8208;incorporation promotes charge separation, intensifies the Lewis acidity of the carbon atoms on the olefinic bond as active sites for O2 adsorption, and provides highly concentrated holes at the triazine unit for HMF oxidation upgrading. This study suggests the attractive potential of rational design of porous&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and biomass upgrading.

         <title>Preventing Benzoquinone&#8208;Based Catalyst Aggregation Enables the One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Highly Conductive Poly(benzodifurandione) without Post&#8208;Reaction Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Tocopherylquinone (&#945;&#8208;TQ), the oxidation product of &#945;&#8208;tocopherol (&#945;&#8208;TOH), catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of 3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione (HBFDO). The saturated aliphatic chiral side chain of &#945;&#8208;TQ suppresses its crystallization, enabling high&#8208;conductivity polymer ink without needing post&#8208;polymerization dialysis. This scalable method, tested in a 20 L reactor, yields ready&#8208;to&#8208;use poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) ink.








Abstract
Conductive polymers have become crucial in advancing various electronic applications. While p&#8208;type materials like poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) are widely used and produced at scale, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers has lagged due to challenges in synthesis and scalability. In this work, a novel method is introduced to synthesize the highly conductive n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) using &#945;&#8208;tocopherylquinone (&#945;&#8208;TQ) as a catalyst. This approach eliminates the need for post&#8208;reaction dialysis, a major obstacle to large&#8208;scale PBFDO production. By preventing catalyst aggregation, high electrical conductivity (&gt;1320 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved, which remains stable in air for over 180 d, significantly simplifying the process. The &#945;&#8208;TQ&#8208;synthesized PBFDO also exhibits excellent thermoelectric properties, with a power factor exceeding 100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymers. Additionally, residual &#945;&#8208;TQ acts as a plasticizer, reducing the elastic modulus by over tenfold while maintaining high conductivity, making this material suitable for mechanically compliant electronics. Similarly, residual &#945;&#8208;TQ lowers the thermal conductivity of PBFDO by more than an order of magnitude. The process is scalable, as demonstrated by producing high&#8208;conductivity ink in a 20 L reactor. This work presents an efficient and sustainable approach for large&#8208;scale n&#8208;type polymer production.

         <title>A 2D/3D Heterostructure Perovskite Solar Cell with a Phase&#8208;Pure and Pristine 2D Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;based method that can achieve pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase&#8208;pure 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure without the need for synthesizing a single crystal is developed. Perovskite solar cells with this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.








Abstract
Interface engineering plays a critical role in advancing the performance of perovskite solar cells. As such, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures are of particular interest due to their optoelectrical properties and their further potential improvements. However, for conventional solution&#8208;processed 2D perovskites grown on an underlying 3D perovskite, the reaction stoichiometry is normally unbalanced with excess precursors. Moreover, the formed 2D perovskite is impure, leading to unfavorable energy band alignment at the interface. Here a simple method is presented that solves both issues simultaneously. The 2D formation reaction is taken first to completion, fully consuming excess PbI2. Then, isopropanol is utilized to remove excess organic ligands, control the 2D perovskite thickness, and obtain a phase&#8208;pure, n = 2, 2D perovskite. The outcome is a pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite heterostructure with improved surface passivation and charge carrier extraction compared to the conventional solution process. PSCs incorporating this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both stability and power conversion efficiency, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.

         <title>Organic Photoelectrochemical Multisensory Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an OPECT&#8208;based chemical MSI with multisensory perception, multimodal synaptic plasticity, and typical MSI features in electrolytes. The advanced MSI device is then used to mimic the associative learning and reflex activities of visual and gustatory stimuli with the associated feedback loops. This work may provide new insight into the development of highly biomimetic MSI in biological fluids for seamless neuro&#8208;robotic systems.









Abstract
Neuromorphic perception capable of multisensory integration (MSI) in electrolytes is important but remains challenging. Here, the aqueous implementation of artificial MSI is reported based on the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT) by representative visual (light)&#8208;gustatory (sour) perception. Under the co&#8208;modulation of light and H+/OH&#8722;, multisensory synaptic plasticity and several typical MSI characteristics are mimicked, including &#8220;super&#8208;additive response,&#8221; &#8220;inverse effectiveness effect&#8221; and &#8220;temporal congruency.&#8221; To demonstrate its potential usage, different types of multisensory associative learning and corresponding reflex activities are further emulated. The chemical MSI system is also utilized to control artificial salivation by a closed loop of real&#8208;time perception, processing, integration, and actuation to emulate the biological responses toward external stimuli. In contrast to previous solid&#8208;state operations, this work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic MSI in aqueous environments that are analogous to those in biology.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Acidic media via Multiscale Catalyst Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an innovative octahedron&#8208;like cobalt structure embedded in hierarchical porous nanofibers, significantly optimizing hydrogen peroxide production in acidic environments. Achieving 80% faradaic efficiency at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stable operation over 120 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, this approach provides a scalable and sustainable pathway to enhance industrial hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Electrochemically generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen offers a more sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional anthraquinone process. In alkaline conditions, H2O2 is unstable as HO2&#8722;, and in neutral electrolytes, alkali cation crossover causes system instability. Producing H2O2 in acidic electrolytes ensures enhanced stability and efficiency. However, in acidic conditions, the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism is dominated by the inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer pathway, requiring careful consideration of both reaction and mass transfer kinetics. These stringent requirements limit H2O2 production efficiency, typically below 10&#8211;20% at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Using a multiscale approach that combines active site tuning with macrostructure tuning, this work presents an octahedron&#8208;like cobalt structure on interconnected hierarchical porous nanofibers, achieving a faradaic efficiency exceeding 80% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable operation for over 120 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. At 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the optimized catalyst demonstrates a cell potential of 2.14&#160;V, resulting in an energy efficiency of 26%.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Directed Nanocellulose Assembly for Interfacial Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic nanocellulose self&#8208;assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil&#8208;water interfaces through charge&#8208;directed assembly. The resulting structures feature uniform &#8220;breathing holes&#8221; (&#8776;34&#160;nm) enabling efficient mass transfer. When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves &gt;90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional catalyst stability through multiple cycles.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces present unique opportunities for sustainable biphasic catalysis, yet concurrent amplification of molecular transport and reactivity at these boundaries remains challenging. Here it is demonstrated that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic nanocellulose (HNC+) spontaneously self&#8208;assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil&#8208;water interfaces through charge&#8208;directed assembly. This assembly is driven by electrostatic attraction between the cationic nanofibers and the intrinsic negative charge at hydrophobic&#8208;aqueous interfaces (&#963; &#8776;&#8722;0.3&#160;C&#160;m&#8722;2), generating sufficient excess attractive force (&#916;U &#8776;&#8722;1,200&#160;kBT) to overcome image charge repulsion. The resulting nanomesh exhibits uniform &#8220;breathing holes&#8221; (&#8776;34&#160;nm) and exceptional stability under extreme conditions (pH 2&#8211;13, 1.8&#160;m NaCl, and 90&#160;&#176;C). When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves &gt;90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional atom economy (E&#8208;factor &lt;&#160;1.1) and catalyst stability through multiple cycles. This breakthrough strategy for interfacial engineering using renewable materials opens new possibilities for green chemical manufacturing while providing fundamental insights into charge&#8208;mediated assembly at liquid interfaces. These findings establish a viable pathway for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis that aligns with circular economy principles.

When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves &amp;gt;90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional atom economy (&lt;i&gt;E-factor&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;&#160;1.1) and catalyst stability through multiple cycles. This breakthrough strategy for interfacial engineering using renewable materials opens new possibilities for green chemical manufacturing while providing fundamental insights into charge-mediated assembly at liquid interfaces. These findings establish a viable pathway for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis that aligns with circular economy principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Groups&#8208;Regulated Organic Semiconductors for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively elaborates on functional groups&#8208;regulated OSCs that enhance photocatalytic H2O2 production performance, such as cyano, imine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, anthraquinone, sulfonic acid, halogen, etc. Functional groups containing O, N, and S elements contribute to increased charge separation and lower energy barriers for intermediate formation, ultimately enhancing the rate of photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly reagent, and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are ideal photocatalysts for the synthesis of H2O2 due to their well&#8208;defined molecular structure, strong donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, and efficient charge separation. This review discusses the regulatory mechanisms of functional group modifications in tuning the photocatalytic performance of OSCs, highlighting the relationship between functional group structure and catalytic performance. For example, electron&#8208;regulating groups, such as cyano and halogen, induce molecular dipoles, facilitating the migration of photogenerated electrons. Fluorine groups optimize the band structure and prolong carrier lifetime due to their high electronegativity. &#960;&#8208;Conjugated extension groups, like anthraquinone and thiophene, expand conjugation, improve visible light capture, and stabilize intermediates through redox cycles. Hydroxyl groups enhance surface hydrophilicity and promote H2O activation, while imine bond protonation adjusts charge distribution and improves selectivity and cycle stability. Multi&#8208;active site functional groups, such as sulfonic acid and amide, accelerate reaction kinetics and inhibit H2O2 decomposition. Functional groups enhance light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions through electronic structure regulation, intermediate adsorption optimization, and proton&#8208;electron transfer. Future work should integrate machine learning to identify optimal functional group combinations and develop green functionalization strategies for efficient H2O2 photocatalyst synthesis.

         <title>A Perspective on Pathways Toward Commercial Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analysis of the existing and prospective sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) systems unveils that a wider application of SIBs should primarily focus on i) regulating the composition, morphology, surface chemistry, safety performance, and production feasibility of mainstream cathodes, ii) enhancing the high&#8208;voltage stability, film formation ability, and cost effectiveness of electrolytes, and iii) reducing irreversible capacity loss and interphase growth of hard carbon anodes based on well&#8208;understood sodium&#8208;ion storage mechanisms.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely adopted in the automotive industry, with an annual global production exceeding 1000&#160;GWh. Despite their success, the escalating demand for LIBs has created concerns on supply chain issues related to key elements, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium and other raw materials. Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs, particularly for grid storage and automotive applications, faces significant hurdles. This perspective article aims to identify the critical challenges in making SIBs viable from both chemical and techno&#8208;economic perspectives. First, a brief comparison of the materials chemistry, working mechanisms, and cost between mainstream LIB systems and prospective SIB systems is provided. The intrinsic challenges of SIBs regarding storage stability, capacity utilization, cycle stability, calendar life, and safe operation of cathode, electrolyte, and anode materials are discussed. Furthermore, issues related to the scalability of material production, materials engineering feasibility, and energy&#8208;dense electrode design and fabrication are illustrated. Finally, promising pathways are listed and discussed toward achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, stable, cost&#8208;effective SIBs.

         <title>Exploring the Mechanisms of Charge Transfer and Identifying Active Sites in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Using Hollow C@MoS2&#8208;Au@CdS Nanostructures as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction photocatalytic reaction mechanism are determined by using transient absorption spectrum, electromagnetic simulation, in situ Raman, and density functional theory theoretical calculation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor nanocomposites are promising candidates for considerably enhancing the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts across the entire solar spectrum. However, the underlying enhancement mechanism remains unclear, and the overall efficiency is still low. Herein, a hollow C@MoS2&#8208;Au@CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst is developed to achieve improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across a broad spectral range. Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments and electromagnetic field simulations demonstrate that compared to the treated sample, the untreated sample exhibits a high density of sulfur vacancies. Consequently, under near&#8208;field enhancement, photogenerated electrons from CdS and hot electrons generated by intra&#8208;band or inter&#8208;band transitions of Au nanoparticles are efficiently transferred to the CdS surface, thus significantly improving the HER activity of CdS. Additionally, in situ, Raman spectroscopy provided spectral evidence of S&#9472;H intermediate species on the CdS surface during the HER process, which is verified through isotope experiments. Density functional theory simulations identify sulfur atoms in CdS as the catalytic active sites for HER. These findings enhance the understanding of charge transfer mechanisms and HER pathways, offering valuable insights for the design of plasmonic photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency.

         <title>Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Using Multifunctional Small Molecule Dopants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbalanced charge carrier injections and high densities of non&#8208;radiative recombination channels are still major obstacles to advancing high&#8208;efficiency blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, a deep&#8208;HOMO level p&#8208;type small molecule, (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid, constructs a better&#8208;balanced carrier injection due to improved hole and retarded electron injection by spontaneously centered at the bottom and top surfaces of perovskites films, along with modulation of all defects in bulk and at surface of doped films due to the formation of covalent bonds. With this approach a series of blue perovskite LEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.03% (485&#160;nm), 16.61% (476&#160;nm), and 8.55% (467&#160;nm) is designed.

Abstract
Silicon (Si) photonics has been widely explored for many various applications, including optical communication, optoelectronic computing, spectroscopy, and image sensing. As a key component for optoelectronic signal conversion in these applications, Si&#8208;based infrared photodetectors have attracted extensive attention. However, achieving all&#8208;Si on&#8208;chip photodetection in the very long&#8208;wavelength infrared (VLWIR) range remains challenging, with broadband enhancement and improved operating temperature being pressing issues that need to be addressed. An all&#8208;Si photodetector design is presented using in&#8208;plane photon trapping structures (IPTS) to enhance detection efficiency and improve the operating temperature of the photodetector at the VLWIR range. The photodetector achieves a broadband enhancement of 285&#8211;575% (across 12&#8211;19&#160;&#181;m) and a 31% reduction in dark current. Additionally, it exhibits an impressive peak specific detectivity of 1.9 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 15&#160;&#181;m, operating at a temperature of 40 K. This study introduces a novel all&#8208;Si optoelectronic device architecture that offers a promising solution for improving the operating temperature and sensitivity of broadband VLWIR devices, making the whole system more compact and cost&#8208;effective.

         <title>In&#8208;liquid Superspreading Space&#8208;confined Epitaxy on Superamphiphilic Surfaces for Pt(II) Complex Crystalline Film Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;liquid superspreading space&#8208;confined epitaxy approach is proposed to fabricate Pt (II) complexes crystalline films on superamphiphilic surface. By regulation of the diffusion process, precise control over the nucleation and crystal growth is achieved, resulting in the formation of planar crystalline films. These films exhibit multi&#8208;signal sensing ability, making them suitable for reaffirmed sensing detector in complex and unstable conditions.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based method is regarded as a promising approach to fabricate large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality crystalline films, owing to its low&#8208;cost manufacturing and facile features. However, traditional solution&#8208;based methods still suffer from random simultaneous nucleation and uncontrollable crystal growth which result in polycrystalline films and coffee&#8208;ring effect. Herein, it is proposed that an in&#8208;liquid superspreading space&#8208;confined epitaxy approach on a superamphiphilic surface to fabricate crystalline films with controllable initial nucleation and crystal morphology. With delicate control of the liquid environment, concentration, and superspreading space&#8208;confined solvent film thickness, planar crystalline films with high crystallinity and smooth morphology are obtained. A controllable dewetting crystallization mechanism is proposed, indicating that the diffusion coefficient, regulated by liquid environment, can control the dewetting process during crystallization. With the balance of solvent diffusion and solute precipitation in crystallization, the ordered in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane molecular stacking is achieved. And the as&#8208;prepared planar Pt(II) complex crystalline film exhibits multi&#8208;signal sensing ability, which can be further used to fabricate the reaffirmed sensing detector for precise gas sensing in complex and unstable conditions. This study demonstrates a facile approach for crystalline film fabrication with controllable nucleation and morphology in a liquid environment, which holds promising applications in the construction of oxygen or water&#8208;sensitive organic/inorganic devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Objective Optimization of Ionic Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging and Versatile Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs multi&#8208;objective kernel&#8208;based Bayesian optimization to efficiently screen ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high&#8208;voltage, fast&#8208;charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs). By examining just 2.8% of the complex chemical space, it achieves multi&#8208;objective optimization for ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and capacity in IPEs. These findings highlight the pivotal role of machine learning in expediting material discovery for advanced batteries.








Abstract
Designing ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium batteries involves searching in a highly complex and discrete chemical space. Traditional material discovery processes struggle with this complexity due to high costs and long evaluation time. A kernel&#8208;based Bayesian optimization is described to complete the multi&#8208;objective optimization by considering ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and discharge capacity simultaneously. According to a recommender based on a union set of acquisition functions, promising IPEs through three iterations with only 2.8% of the chemical space is targeted. The achieved lithium metal batteries exhibit promising performance with ultrahigh cutoff voltage with NCM811 (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, 4.8&#160;V) and LNMO (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, 4.92&#160;V). To further extend the versatility of IPEs and diminish the high cost associated with the glove&#8208;box environment, an aqueous and high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion battery is developed by introducing water molecules in IPEs coupled with Li4Ti5O12||LiMn2O4, a strong hydrogen bonding network formed between the rigid&#8208;rod polyelectrolyte and the embedded water molecules, which effectively suppresses the water reactivity, meanwhile boosting the ionic conductivity. This work reveals an innovative multi&#8208;objective optimization that effectively handles multi&#8208;targets and discontinuous parameter space, offering critical insights to address complex challenges in material discovery and property optimization for advanced and versatile lithium batteries.

         <title>A Polymeric mRNA Vaccine Featuring Enhanced Site&#8208;Specific mRNA Delivery and Inherent STING&#8208;Stimulating Performance for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POctS is an innovative, simple to prepare mRNA delivery carrier that has both high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#8208;stimulating function. More importantly, the unique site&#8208;specific delivery ability of POctS achieves mRNA expression in specific sites and the exertion of STING&#8208;stimulating function in specific sites, resulting in minimization of formulation toxicity and maximization of mRNA vaccine efficacy.








Abstract
The development of mRNA delivery carriers with innate immune stimulation functions has emerged as a focal point in the field of mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the expression of mRNA in specific sites and innate immune stimulation at specific sites are prerequisites for ensuring the safety of mRNA vaccines. Based on the synthetic PEIRs carriers library, this study identifies an innovative mRNA delivery carrier named POctS with the following characteristics: 1) simultaneously possessing high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) stimulation function. 2) Leveraging the distinctive site&#8208;specific delivery capabilities of POctS, the expression of mRNA at specific sites and the activation of innate immune responses at designated sites are achieved, minimizing formulation toxicity and maximizing the vaccine performance. 3) Tailoring two types of mRNA vaccines based on POctS according to the immune infiltration status of different types of tumors. Briefly, POctS&#8208;loading ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA as a tumor antigen vaccine achieves the prevention and treatment of melanoma in mice. Further, POctS&#8208;loading mixed lineage kinase domain&#8208;like protein (MLKL) mRNA as an in situ tumor vaccine effectively treats orthotopic pancreatic cancer in mice. This delivery carrier offers a feasible mRNA vaccine&#8208;based immunotherapy strategy for various types of tumors.

         <title>Integrating Strong Luminescence and High Mobility in Organic Single Crystals of Covalent Pyrene Dimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&#181; = 32.6 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) are simultaneously harvested in the single crystal of covalent pyrene dimer, which is substantially ascribed to the strong emission from intramolecular hybridized local and charge&#8722;transfer state and the 2D charge transport enabled by the intermolecular uniform herringbone stacking.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving strong luminescence and high mobility in organic semiconductors remains a challenge. Herein, two covalently dimerized pyrene derivatives (1Py&#8208;2Py and 1Py&#8208;1Py) with distinct chemical linkages and crystal packing arrangements are presented. Remarkably, the radiative transition of pyrene is gradually unforbidden from 1Py&#8208;2Py to 1Py&#8208;1Py. Moreover, 1Py&#8208;2Py showcases 1D long&#8208;range &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, while 1Py&#8208;1Py exhibits 2D herringbone packing formed by a vast network of intermolecular C&#9472;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions. To the surprise, both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&#181; = 32.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) are simultaneously harvested in 1Py&#8208;1Py crystal, which are far superior to those in 1Py&#8208;2Py crystal (PLQY = 48.66% and &#181; = 0.05 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). These findings underscore the potential of covalent pyrene dimer with 1&#8208;position linkages as a promising organic semiconductor for the exceptional combination of strong luminescence and high mobility, which is substantially ascribed to the efficiently unforbidden emission and the favorable 2D charge transport pathways.

&lt;p&gt;Both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt; = 32.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are simultaneously harvested in the single crystal of covalent pyrene dimer, which is substantially ascribed to the strong emission from intramolecular hybridized local and charge&#8722;transfer state and the 2D charge transport enabled by the intermolecular uniform herringbone stacking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously achieving strong luminescence and high mobility in organic semiconductors remains a challenge. Herein, two covalently dimerized pyrene derivatives (1Py-2Py and 1Py-1Py) with distinct chemical linkages and crystal packing arrangements are presented. Remarkably, the radiative transition of pyrene is gradually unforbidden from 1Py-2Py to 1Py-1Py. Moreover, 1Py-2Py showcases 1D long-range &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, while 1Py-1Py exhibits 2D herringbone packing formed by a vast network of intermolecular C&#9472;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions. To the surprise, both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt; = 32.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are simultaneously harvested in 1Py-1Py crystal, which are far superior to those in 1Py-2Py crystal (PLQY = 48.66% and &lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). These findings underscore the potential of covalent pyrene dimer with 1-position linkages as a promising organic semiconductor for the exceptional combination of strong luminescence and high mobility, which is substantially ascribed to the efficiently unforbidden emission and the favorable 2D charge transport pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Cell to Module Efficiency Remaining Ratio of &#8776;90% for the 100&#160;cm2 Fully Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Gravure Printed Flexible Organic Solar Cells From Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent</title>

         <dc:description>
This work gives an insight into solvent&#8208;dependent rheology properties and phase separation dynamics for the R2R printing of flexible organic solar cells. With o&#8208;XY solvent, the fully R2R gravure&#8208;printed 1 and 28&#8211;104&#160;cm2 large&#8208;area modules give efficiencies of 14.67% and over 13%, respectively, with a high cell&#8208;to&#8208;module remaining ratio of 0.9 during upscaling.








Abstract
The cell&#8208;to&#8208;module (CTM) efficiency remaining ratio from monolithic device to large&#8208;area module indicates the scalability potential for large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs). Nowadays, the CTM value is still low as the area increases to larger than 100 cm2. In this work, the crucial role of solvent in CTM for printing, which on one side influenced the large area homogeneity due to the ink rheology property, and on the other side impacted phase separation dynamics because of vaporization and crystalline rate is highlighted. The films from TMB show excessive pure phase and printing line defects in vertical the printing direction due to slow volatilization speed and low adhesion, while Tol&#8208;based films present printing line defects along the printing direction due to large surface adhesion are demonstrated. In contrast, the films from non&#8208;halogenated solvent, o&#8208;XY exhibited a suitable phase separation size and excellent large&#8208;area homogeneity. Consequently, the fully printed 1&#160;cm2 FOSCs exhibit an efficiency of 14.81%. Moreover, the FOSCs module with an area of 28&#8211;104&#160;cm2 gives an efficiency of over 13%, with a CTM of 0.9. Selecting suitable non&#8208;halogenated solvents to achieve large&#8208;area uniformity and appropriate phase separation morphology in &gt;100&#160;cm2 modules is of great importance for the industrialization of FOSCs.

         <title>Translational Selenium Nanoparticles Promotes Clinical Non&#8208;small&#8208;cell Lung Cancer Chemotherapy via Activating Selenoprotein&#8208;driven Immune Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs&#8208;enhanced therapeutic efficacy against advanced NSCLC and elucidates the underlying mechanisms involving selenoprotein&#8208;driven immune manipulation. The clinical Investigator&#8208;initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein&#8208;driven antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment is an effective strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy limited by immunosuppression in non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, it is found that selenium (Se) depletion and immune dysfunction are present in patients with advanced NSCLC compared with healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, Se deficiency resulted in decreased immunity and accelerated rapid tumor growth in the mice model, which further reveals that the correlation between micronutrient Se and lung cancer progression. This pioneering work achieves 500&#8208;L scale production of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) at GMP level and utilizes it to reveal how and why the trace element Se can enhance clinical immune&#8208;mediated treatment efficacy against NSCLC. The results found that translational SeNPs can promote the proliferation of NK cells and enhance its cytotoxicity against cancer cells by activating mTOR signaling pathway driven by GPXs to regulate the secretion of cytokines to achieve an antitumor response. Moreover, a clinical study of an Investigator&#8208;initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein&#8208;driven antitumor immunity. Taken together, this study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs&#8208;enhanced therapeutic efficacy against clinical advanced NSCLC.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Inspired Cluster Fabrication within Mesoporous Channels Featuring Optimized Catalytic Microenvironments for Efficient Neutral pH H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by some metalloenzymes, bismuth metal clusters are used as active sites and coupled with mesoporous channels to create a favorable catalytic microenvironment, enabling efficient electrocatalysis of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in neutral media, with an industrially relevant current density and an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 21.4 mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 over 120 h.








Abstract
In nature, some metalloenzymes facilitate highly efficient catalytic transformations of small molecules, primarily attributed to the effective coupling between their metal cluster active sites and the surrounding microenvironment. Inspired by this, a thermotropic redispersion strategy to incorporate bismuth nanoclusters (Bi NCs) into mesoporous channels, mimicking metalloenzyme&#8208;like catalysis to enhance the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for efficient neutral pH H2O2 electrosynthesis, is developed. This model electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance with &gt;95% H2O2 selectivity across 0.2&#8211;0.6 V vs RHE in neutral electrolyte. Notably, the system produces up to 7.2 wt% neutral H2O2 solution at an industrially relevant current density of &#8776;320 mA cm&#8722;2, with 90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 over 120 h in a flow cell, demonstrating significant practical potential. Mechanistic insights reveal that the introduction of Bi NCs enhances the adsorption of the *OOH intermediate, facilitating a highly active 2e&#8722; ORR process. Moreover, the mesoporous channels of the carbon support create a favorable catalytic microenvironment for O2 aeration and local alkalinity, further boosting H2O2 productivity. This catalyst design mimics metalloenzymes by optimal integration of the active site with the surrounding microenvironment, offering valuable insights for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired small&#8208;molecule catalysts.

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Nanochannels for High&#8208;Capacity Capture of Uranyl Tricarbonate Complex Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8211;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework to obtain biomimetic nanochannels for [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions. The unique structure enabled a selective capture of [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 35 days.








Abstract
Biomimetic nanochannels enable fast and selective transport of mononuclear metal ions; however, their construction for complex ion transport remains in its infancy due to the nonuniform charge distribution and large geometric dimensions of coordination compounds. Herein, an ionic electrostatic interaction template strategy is proposed to prepare biomimetic channels for the capture of complex ions. Using the [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ion as a template, various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8722;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework via the Williamson ether reaction. Accordingly, the pore size is modulated in the sub&#8208;nanometer range of 9&#8722;13 &#197;, facilitating multiple electrostatic attractions between quaternary ammonium fragments and the three equatorial carbonate ions on the [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ion. The unique structure enabled highly efficient uranium adsorption with a capacity of 501.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and a high selectivity coefficient for uranium over vanadium of &gt;163.1. The resulting electropositive nanochannels selectively captured [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 35 days.

&lt;p&gt;Various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8211;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework to obtain biomimetic nanochannels for [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The unique structure enabled a selective capture of [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 35 days.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic nanochannels enable fast and selective transport of mononuclear metal ions; however, their construction for complex ion transport remains in its infancy due to the nonuniform charge distribution and large geometric dimensions of coordination compounds. Herein, an ionic electrostatic interaction template strategy is proposed to prepare biomimetic channels for the capture of complex ions. Using the [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion as a template, various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8722;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework via the Williamson ether reaction. Accordingly, the pore size is modulated in the sub-nanometer range of 9&#8722;13 &#197;, facilitating multiple electrostatic attractions between quaternary ammonium fragments and the three equatorial carbonate ions on the [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion. The unique structure enabled highly efficient uranium adsorption with a capacity of 501.5&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high selectivity coefficient for uranium over vanadium of &amp;gt;163.1. The resulting electropositive nanochannels selectively captured [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 35 days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electromagnetically Heating and Oscillating Liquid Metal for Catalyzing Polyester Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal alloys provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within their surface layers. Under alternating electromagnetic fields, these alloys can serve as the efficient self&#8208;heater, mechanic disturber, and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polycaprolactone with a rate &#8776;700 mg h&#8722;1 mL&#8722;1 and monomer selectivity &#8776;95.5%, offering an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform for continuous polyester depolymerization.








Abstract
Depolymerization and recycling of polyesters have shown great significance to economy, ecology, carbon neutrality and human health. Efficient catalysts for thermolysis depolymerization have long been pursued to achieve rapid depolymerization, high selectivity, and low energy consumption. In this study, it is found that liquid metal (LM) can serve as the efficient self&#8208;heater, mechanic disturber and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters under alternating electromagnetic fields. When dissolving different metals (e.g., Sn, Zn, Al, and Mg) into gallium, LMs may provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within the LM surface layer. Without any conventional heaters and mechanic shakers, polycaprolactone is catalytically depolymerized into &#603;&#8208;caprolactone at the rate of &#8776;700&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mL&#8722;1 with the selectivity of 95.5%. The high surface tension and high mobility of LM also enable continuous depolymerization at an appropriate feeding speed of polyesters (including polyethylene terephthalate, polyhydroxybutyrate and polylactic acid). Thus, this study may offer an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform of liquid metal for continuous thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters, while without any requirement of external heater, mixer, and catalysts.

         <title>Anion Vacancies Coupling with Heterostructures Enable Advanced Aerogel Cathode for Ultrafast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by DFT calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy&#8208;rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed based on the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, and utilized as a cathode for ZIBs/ZICs for the first time, achieving significantly enhanced electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations are utilized to reveal the phase transition mechanism.








Abstract
As a potential cathode material, manganese&#8208;based sulfide has recently attracted increasing interest due to its many advantages in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion storage. Unfortunately, some challenges such as sluggish kinetics, unstable structure, and controversial phase transition mechanism during the energy storage process hinder its practical application. Herein, inspired by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy&#8208;rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed, and used as a cathode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries/hybrid capacitors (ZIBs/ZICs) for the first time. Thanks to the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, the as&#8208;constructed MnS/MXene//Zn ZIBs exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, especially outstanding rate capability and cyclic stability. More encouragingly, the as&#8208;assembled MnS/MXene//porous carbon (PC) ZICs exhibit an ultrahigh energy density, a high power density, and a splendid cycling lifespan. Most notably, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations illustrate that MnS/MXene first irreversibly converts into MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene, and then undergoes a reversible conversion from MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene to MnOOH@ZnMn2O4/MXene, accompanied by the co&#8208;insertion/extraction of H+ and Zn2+. The synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures and the thorough mechanistic study proposed in this work offer valuable guidance for designing and exploiting high&#8208;performance cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Flexible Pixelated Perovskite Photodetectors Enabled by Honeycomb Polymer Grids for High&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired, photolithography&#8208;free, flexible, pixelated perovskite photosensitive films serve not only as a high&#8208;resolution pixelation platform but also as a stress&#8208;relief mechanism for otherwise brittle perovskite films, enabling enhanced mechanical flexibility. This synergetic approach yields pixelated perovskite layers with &#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m pixel sizes, &#8776;100&#160;nm gaps, and 2000 PPI resolution. Assembled photodetector arrays offer detectivity greater than 1013 Jones with cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free imaging. The flexible polymer grid also enhances mechanical durability, expanding potential applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual/augmented reality.








Abstract
A nature&#8208;inspired fabrication method based on a photolithography&#8208;free flexible polymer grid is reported for high&#8208;resolution pixelation of perovskite photodiode arrays with exceptional mechanical ductility and a morphology resembling that of natural compound eyes. The resulting pixelated perovskite photosensitive layer has a &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m pixel size with 2000 Pixels per inch (PPI) resolution when fully assembled as a photodetector array, delivering a detectivity of &gt;1013 Jones while providing cross&#8208;talk free imaging. Using a polymer grid effectively releases stress on the perovskite platform, greatly increasing the mechanical agility of the otherwise brittle perovskite film. This novel fabrication methodology and device design offer new possibilities for applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual and augmented reality.

         <title>Amorphous High&#8208;entropy Phosphide Nanosheets With Multi&#8208;atom Catalytic Sites for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable electrodeposition combined phosphorization method is reported to synthesize a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine&#8208;tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm&#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalytic applications.

Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine-tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high-entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting-edge electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions
The sluggish sulfur conversion reaction is a bottleneck for the improvement of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery performance. In article number 2413653, Feng Li, Zhenhua Sun, Tong Yu, and co&#8208;workers reveal that long&#8208;range interactions in high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts regulate the electron states, facilitating sulfur conversion. The cover illustrates that different metal atoms accelerate electron transport, thereby boosting high&#8208;rate performance.

Mn&#8208;Based 2D Magnetoplumbites
In article number 2417906, Xin Gui and co&#8208;workers report the first Mn&#8208;based M&#8208;type hexaferrites, also known as magnetoplumbites. Mn3+ cations construct frustrated triangular, Kagome, and puckered honeycomb sublattices. Magnetic and heat capacity do not exhibit long&#8208;range magnetic order. Two&#8208;dimensional magnetic correlations and frustration within the Mn3+ Kagome layers are confirmed via the reverse Monte Carlo refinements on neutron powder diffraction patterns.

         <title>From Printed Devices to Vertically Stacked, 3D Flexible Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed electronics, with their extensive versatility, resource efficiency, and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities, offer an attractive alternative to Si&#8208;based CMOS technology. This paper reviews the recent advances in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies that could lead to high performance, as well as attributes such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and vertical stack leading to 3D integration.








Abstract
The pursuit of miniaturized Si electronics has revolutionized computing and communication. During recent years, the value addition in electronics has also been achieved through printing, flexible and stretchable electronics form factors, and integration over areas larger than wafer size. Unlike Si semiconductor manufacturing which takes months from tape&#8208;out to wafer production, printed electronics offers greater flexibility and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities with lesser resources and waste generation. While significant advances have been made with various types of printed sensors and other passive devices, printed circuits still lag behind Si&#8208;based electronics in terms of performance, integration density, and functionality. In this regard, recent advances using high&#8208;resolution printing coupled with the use of high mobility materials and device engineering, for both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane integration, raise hopes. This paper focuses on the progress in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies and related aspects such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and the novel functionalities enabled by vertical integration of printed electronics. By highlighting these advances, this paper intends to reveal the future promise of printed electronics as a sustainable and resource&#8208;efficient route for realizing high&#8208;performance integrated circuits and systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Infrared Plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of ultrafast infrared plasmonics covering the fundamental principles, material systems, manipulation methods, detection techniques, and promising applications. Furthermore, it highlights the future potential of ultrafast infrared plasmonics as a novel platform for exploring ultrafast electronic correlation effects and many&#8208;body interactions.








Abstract
Ultrafast plasmonics represents a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in light&#8208;matter interactions, providing a unique platform to study electronic interactions and collective motions across femtosecond to picosecond timescales. In the infrared regime, where energy aligns with the rearrangements of low&#8208;energy electrons, molecular vibrations, and thermal fluctuations, ultrafast plasmonics can be a powerful tool for revealing ultrafast electronic phase transitions, controlling molecular reactions, and driving subwavelength thermal processes. Here, the evolution of ultrafast infrared plasmonics, discussing the recent progress in their manipulation, detection, and applications is reviewed. The future opportunities, including their potential to probe electronic correlations, investigate intrinsic ultrafast plasmonic interactions, and enable advanced applications in quantum information are highlighted, which may be promoted by multi&#8208;physical field integrated ultrafast techniques.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategies Targeting Nutritional Deprivation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the abnormal nutrient requirements of tumor cells and tumor tissues, this study focuses on the nutrient and metabolic characteristics of tumor cells and other cell members of the tumor microenvironment and summarizes relevant nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies, which is of great significance for the development of new nutrition&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.








Abstract
Higher and richer nutrient requirements are typical features that distinguish tumor cells from AU: cells, ensuring adequate substrates and energy sources for tumor cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies can induce impaired cell viability in tumor cells, which are more sensitive than normal cells. In this review, nutrients that are required by tumor cells and related metabolic pathways are introduced, and anti&#8208;tumor strategies developed to target nutrient deprivation are described. In addition to tumor cells, the nutritional and metabolic characteristics of other cells in the tumor microenvironment (including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, T cells, and cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts) and related new anti&#8208;tumor strategies are also summarized. In conclusion, recent advances in anti&#8208;tumor strategies targeting nutrient blockade are reviewed, and the challenges and prospects of these anti&#8208;tumor strategies are discussed, which are of theoretical significance for optimizing the clinical application of tumor nutrition deprivation strategies.

         <title>2D Molecular Crystals for Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices: Status and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of the structures of 2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) and strategies to modify their morphology and properties. Next, it summarizes preparation methods for large&#8208;scale 2D MCs by solution&#8208;based processes or vapor deposition. Finally, it highlights the applications of 2D MCs in electronic and optoelectronic devices with the advantages of tunable properties and scalable preparation methods.








Abstract
2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) are an emerging family of 2D materials formed by organic or inorganic molecules held together entirely by weak intermolecular forces. 2D MCs are gaining attention in electronics and optoelectronics due to their structural diversity, scalability, and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of 2D MCs and their potential in electronic and optoelectronic applications. It begins by highlighting the structural features and properties of key 2D MCs discovered to date, focusing on three strategies to manipulate intermolecular forces for better control over crystal morphology and properties. Then various methods are explored for fabricating large&#8208;area, highly&#8208;oriented 2D MCs, with an emphasis on vapor&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase techniques. Last, their applications are reviewed in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as channel materials, photosensitive components, and dielectrics. It is concluded by discussing future challenges and opportunities in the field, offering insights into scalable production and industrial applications of 2D MCs.

         <title>Transforming Adsorbate Surface Dynamics in Aqueous Electrocatalysis: Pathways to Unconstrained Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in operando characterizations and computational simulations have unveiled the unconventional and dynamic nature of surface&#8208;bound reaction intermediates in aqueous electrochemical systems. By tailoring electronic properties and atomic structures of catalytic surfaces, researchers can manipulate adsorbate dynamics to enable energetically favorable reaction pathways, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints inherent in conventional reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalysts to accelerate sluggish electrode reactions is critical for the deployment of sustainable aqueous electrochemical technologies, yet remains a great challenge. Rationally integrating functional components to tailor surface adsorption behaviors and adsorbate dynamics would divert reaction pathways and alleviate energy barriers, eliminating conventional thermodynamic constraints and ultimately optimizing energy flow within electrochemical systems. This approach has, therefore, garnered significant interest, presenting substantial potential for developing highly efficient catalysts that simultaneously enhance activity, selectivity, and stability. The immense promise and rapid evolution of this design strategy, however, do not overshadow the substantial challenges and ambiguities that persist, impeding the realization of significant breakthroughs in electrocatalyst development. This review explores the latest insights into the principles guiding the design of catalytic surfaces that enable favorable adsorbate dynamics within the contexts of hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry. Innovative approaches for tailoring adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions are discussed, delving into underlying principles that govern these dynamics. Additionally, perspectives on the prevailing challenges are presented and future research directions are proposed. By evaluating the core principles and identifying critical research gaps, this review seeks to inspire rational electrocatalyst design, the discovery of novel reaction mechanisms and concepts, and ultimately, advance the large&#8208;scale implementation of electroconversion technologies.

         <title>Proton Storage Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Inorganic Batteries with Moderate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed, and the four proton storage reaction patterns, the proton storage, and transport processes are well refined. The characterization techniques of proton storage are carefully introduced. Especially, the four structural engineering of proton storage modulation are highlighted.








Abstract
The proton (H+) has been proved to be another important energy storage ion besides Zn2+ in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes. H+ storage usually possesses better thermodynamics and reaction kinetics than Zn2+, and is found to be an important addition for Zn2+ storage. Thus, understanding, characterizing, and modulating H+ storage in inorganic cathode materials is particularly important. In this review, recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed. First, the four proton storage reaction patterns of H+ insertion, H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion, H+&#8208;dependent conversion, and H+&#8208;dependent dissolution/deposition reaction are explicitly presented. Meanwhile, the proton storage processes of multi&#8208;sites and multi&#8208;steps, and the Hopping and Grotthuss proton transport mechanisms are carefully introduced. Second, the characterization techniques of proton storage are systematically classified into four types of electrochemical characterization techniques of batteries, structural characterization techniques of inorganic cathodes, pH characterization technique of electrolyte, and quantitative analysis technologies of H+ storage contribution. Third, the structural engineering of proton storage modulation is preliminarily refined to be interlayer engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, composite engineering, and other engineering. Finally, the emerging challenges and perspectives about future directions of proton storage chemistry are proposed.

         <title>A Biomimetic Sweeping Microrobot for Active Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by sweeping robots, a Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers is designed for the active therapy of ulcerative colitis. The self&#8208;driven ability endows the microswimmer with augmented contact probability with surrounding disease triggers, which contributes to enhanced disease triggers removal efficiency, promising to achieve precise control of the inflammatory storms of ulcerative colitis.








Abstract
Overproduction of pathogenic cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays crucial roles in the onset and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis (UC). Inspired by sweeping robots, a magnesium@polylactic acid&#8208;glycolic acid copolymer@polyethylenimine (Mg@PLGA@PEI) microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers along its path of progress is designed. Mg@PLGA@PEI is successfully synthesized by adopting a core&#8208;shell structure with a small opening which allows for Mg&#8208;water reaction. The distinctive motility performance resulting from sustained detachment of the produced hydrogen not only contributes to strengthened hydrogen diffusion concomitant with potentiated ROS neutralization, but also facilitates the contacting probability with microenvironmental cfDNA and thus enhances the DNA binding efficiency. By integrating these merits, the developed Mg@PLGA@PEI confers desirable curative efficacy in a classical DSS&#8208;induced acute colitis mouse model. Enema administration of Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmers substantially alleviates the manifestations related to UC, as evidenced by the body weight recovery, colon length retention, colon tissue protection, and attenuated intestinal inflammation, which is attributed to the active scavenging of cfDNA and ROS. This work provides a paradigm for a drug&#8208;free strategy competent in spontaneously eliminating causative triggers with minimal side effects, which presents a promising alternative for the active therapy of UC or other cfDNA&#8208; and ROS&#8208;related diseases in the clinic.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by sweeping robots, a Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers is designed for the active therapy of ulcerative colitis. The self-driven ability endows the microswimmer with augmented contact probability with surrounding disease triggers, which contributes to enhanced disease triggers removal efficiency, promising to achieve precise control of the inflammatory storms of ulcerative colitis.

         <title>Tissue Mimetic Membranes for Healing Augmentation of Tendon&#8211;Bone Interface in Rotator Cuff Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a tissue&#8208;mimetic membrane for functional tendon&#8211;bone interface regeneration is fabricated. During the implantation, a biomimicry and inductive microenvironment is created by the region&#8208;specific configuration and spatiotemporal release of chondroinductive kartogenin&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteoinductive struvite. The In Vitro and in vivo findings validate the prominent regenerative efficacy in rotator cuff repair.








Abstract
The globally prevalent rotator cuff tear has a high re&#8208;rupture rate, attributing to the failure to reproduce the interfacial fibrocartilaginous enthesis. Herein, a hierarchically organized membrane is developed that mimics the heterogeneous anatomy and properties of the natural enthesis and finely facilitates the reconstruction of tendon&#8211;bone interface. A biphasic membrane consisting of a microporous layer and a mineralized fibrous layer is constructed through the non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) strategy followed by a co&#8208;axial electrospinning procedure. Cationic kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteo&#8208;promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region&#8208;specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel&#8208;KGN&#8208;functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite&#8208;containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue&#8208;specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect&#8208;healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Entropy Design for Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for advanced high&#8208;power capacitors. Atomic&#8208;scale investigations determine that introduction of specific elements (Mg, La, Ca, and Sr) can enhance ferroelectric relaxation behavior by different magnitudes. Disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall polar nanoscale regions are detected in the high&#8208;entropy ceramics after introducing trace amounts of Mg and La. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and efficiency of 90% are achieved in a designed high&#8208;entropy ceramic.








Abstract
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for the development of advanced high&#8208;power capacitors. However, achieving ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density and efficiency remains challenging, limiting the progress of leading&#8208;edge energy storage applications. In this study, (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (BNT) is selected as the matrix, and the effects of different A&#8208;site elements on domain morphology, lattice polarization, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated. Mg, La, Ca, and Sr are shown to enhance relaxation behavior by different magnitudes; hence, a high&#8208;entropy strategy for designing local polymorphic distortions is proposed. Based on atomic&#8208;scale investigations, a series of BNT&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy compositions are designed by introducing trace amounts of Mg and La to improve the electric breakdown strength and further disrupt the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs). A disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall PNRs with a minimum size of &#8776;1 nm are detected in the high&#8208;entropy ceramics. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 90% are achieved for (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2Mg0.05La0.05Bi0.15Na0.15)TiO3. Furthermore, it displays a high&#8208;power density of 584 MW&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an ultrashort discharge time of 27 ns. This work presents an effective approach for designing dielectric energy storage materials with superior comprehensive performance via a high&#8208;entropy strategy.

         <title>Xolography for Biomedical Applications: Dual&#8208;Color Light&#8208;Sheet Printing of Hydrogels With Local Control Over Shape and Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paving the way towards 3D&#160;light&#8208;based (bio)printing with spatiotemporal control over structural and mechanical properties&#8212;Xolography of hydrogel&#8208;based photoresins enables the fabrication of high&#8208;resolution constructs with locally modulated stiffness and programmable shape changes.








Abstract
Current challenges in tissue engineering include creation of extracellular environments that support and interact with cells using biochemical, mechanical, and structural cues. Spatial control over these cues is currently limited due to a lack of suitable fabrication techniques. This study introduces Xolography, an emerging dual&#8208;color light&#8208;sheet volumetric printing technology, to achieve control over structural and mechanical features for hydrogel&#8208;based photoresins at micro&#8208; to macroscale while printing within minutes. A water&#8208;soluble photoswitch photoinitiator system and a library of naturally&#8208;derived, synthetic, and thermoresponsive hydrogels for Xolography are proposed. Centimeter&#8208;scale, 3D constructs with positive features of 20&#160;&#181;m and negative features of &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m are fabricated with control over mechanical properties (compressive moduli 0.2&#160;kPa&#8211;6.5&#160;MPa). Notably, switching from binary to grayscaled light projection enables spatial control over stiffness (0.2&#8211;16&#160;kPa). As a proof of concept, grayscaled Xolography is leveraged with thermoresponsive hydrogels to introduce reversible anisotropic shape changes beyond isometric shrinkage. Xolography of viable cell aggregates is finally demonstrated, laying the foundation for cell&#8208;laden printing of dynamic, cell&#8208;instructive environments with tunable structural and mechanical cues in a fast one&#8208;step process. Overall, these innovations unlock unique possibilities of Xolography across multiple biomedical applications.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Selective Mechanical Enhancement of Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticle Composites via Light&#8208;Mediated Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;mediated crosslinkers are incorporated into a polymer&#8208;grafted nanoparticle composite system. This method enables &gt;15&#8208;fold enhancement of tensile modulus upon crosslinking and can be applied to a wide range of monomer compositions. Furthermore, the regio&#8208;selective nature of photocrosslinking allows for the fabrication of compositionally continuous composites with intentionally designed anisotropic mechanical responses, demonstrated via the fabrication of a stiffness&#8208;patterned soft electronic substrate.








Abstract

This method enables &amp;gt;15-fold enhancement of tensile modulus upon crosslinking and can be applied to a wide range of monomer compositions.

The 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets are systematically synthesized with an in situ formed &#8776;2 nm&#8208;thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te&#8208;Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition method.

Abstract
The exchange bias (EB) effect is a fundamental magnetic phenomenon, in which the exchange bias field/coercive field ratio (|HEB/HC|) can improve the stability of spintronic devices. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic heterostructures have the potential to construct low&#8208;power and high&#8208;density spintronic devices, while their typically air unstable and |HEB/HC| lesser, limiting the possibility of applications. Here, 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets have been systematically synthesized with an in situ formed &#8776;2 nm&#8208;thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te&#8208;Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures. Meanwhile, the uniformity of thickness and chemical composition of the Te&#8208;Cr2O3 layer can be controlled by the growth conditions which are highly correlated with the EB effect of 2D Te&#8208;Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the Te&#8208;Cr2O3 can provide uncompensated spins in the Cr2O3, thus forming strong spin pinning effect. The systematical investigation of the EB effect in 2D Te&#8208;Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures with high |HEB/HC| will open up exciting opportunities in low&#8208;power and high&#8208;stability 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>Heterodimeric Photosensitizer as Radical Generators to Promoting Type I Photodynamic Conversion for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In heterodimeric NBSSe, the NBS/NBSe radical pair formation in the co&#8208;excited NBSSe* after intramolecular electron transfer successfully converts type II into type I photodynamic pathway on a traditional type II photosensitizer NBSe of high reactive oxygen species yield. Incorporating electron&#8208;rich BSA further promotes O2&#8208;&#183; generation and photostability of this radical generator via recycling radicals, with an efficient tumor targeting capability for BSA@NBSSe.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using traditional type II photosensitizers (PSs) has been limited in hypoxic tumors due to excessive oxygen consumption. The conversion from type II into a less oxygen&#8208;dependent type I PDT pathway has shown the potential to combat hypoxic tumors. Herein, the design of a heterodimeric PS, NBSSe, by conjugating a widely used type I PS NBS and a type II PS NBSe via molecular dimerization, achieving the aggregation&#8208;regulated efficient type I photodynamic conversion for the first time is reported. Electrochemistry characterizations and theoretical calculations elucidate that NBSSe tends to form a S+&#183;/Se&#8722;&#183; radical pair via intramolecular electron transfer in the co&#8208;excited NBSSe* aggregate, realizing 7.25&#8208;fold O2&#8722;&#183; generation compared to NBS and 80% suppression of 1O2 generation compared to NBSe. The enhanced O2&#8722;&#183; generation of NBSSe enables excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia PDT efficiency and inhibition of pulmonary metastasis. Additionally, the incorporation of electron&#8208;rich bovine serum albumin accelerates the recycling of cationic PS radical NBSSe+&#183;, further boosting photostability and O2&#8722;&#183; generation. The resultant BSA@NBSSe nanoparticles demonstrate successful tumor&#8208;targeting PDT capability. This work provides an appealing avenue to convert ROS generation from the type II pathway to the type I pathway for efficient cancer phototherapy in hypoxia.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Gap&#8208;Rich PdMn Nanofibers with High Mass/Electron Transport Highways for Electrocatalytic Reforming of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers, featuring with high mass/electron transport highways, which is used as an efficient catalyst of polyethylene terephthalate to high&#8208;valued glycolic acid at an industrial current.








Abstract
Innovating nanocatalysts with both high intrinsic catalytic activity and high selectivity is crucial for multi&#8208;electron reactions, however, their low mass/electron transport at industrial&#8208;level currents is often overlooked, which usually leads to low comprehensive performance at the device level. Herein, a Cl&#8722;/O2 etching&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy is reported for synthesizing a self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers with high mass/electron transport highway for greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic reforming of waste plastics at industrial&#8208;level currents. The self&#8208;assembled PdMn nanofiber shows excellent catalytic activity in upcycling waste plastics into glycolic acid, with a high current density of 223 mA cm&#8722;2@0.75 V (vs RHE), high selectivity (95.6%), and Faraday efficiency (94.3%) to glycolic acid in a flow electrolyzer. Density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of highly oxophilic Mn induces a downshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd, which optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on PdMn surface, thereby facilitating the desorption of glycolic acid as a high&#8208;value product. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirm that the gap&#8208;rich nanofiber structure is conducive for mass transfer to deliver an industrial&#8208;level current.

         <title>PerC B&#8208;Cells Activation via Thermogenetics&#8208;Based CXCL12 Generator for Intraperitoneal Immunity Against Metastatic Disseminated Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isotropic&#8208;porous, cell&#8208;fitting, thermogenetics&#8208;based chemokine CXCL12 generator is described as a B&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent intraperitoneal immunotherapy&#160;that can trigger intraperitoneal anti&#8208;tumor immunity against metastatic disseminated tumor cell to assuage peritoneal effusion and peritoneal metastasis. Unexpectedly, the peritoneal cavity B cell subset is identified as playing a key role in exogenous antigen presentation and presenting a unique transcriptional signature.








Abstract
During cancer peritoneal metastasis (PM), conventional antigen&#8208;presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in peritoneal cavity. While intraperitoneal immunotherapy (IPIT) has been used in clinical investigations to relieve PM, the limited knowledge of peritoneal immunocytes has hindered the development of therapeutic IPIT. Here, a dendritic cell&#8208;independent, next&#8208;generation IPIT is described that activates peritoneal cavity B (PerC B) cell subsets for intraperitoneal anti&#8208;tumor immunity via exogenous antigen presentation. The PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved IPIT framework consists of an isotropic&#8208;porous, cell&#8208;fitting, thermogenetics&#8208;based CXCL12 generator. Such nanoscale thermal&#8208;confined generator can programmatically fine&#8208;tune the expression of CXCL12 to recruit disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) through CXCL12&#8208;CXCR4 axis while avoiding cytokine storm, subsequently release DTC&#8208;derived antigen to trigger PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved immunity. Notably, antigen&#8208;presenting B&#8208;cell cluster, expressing the regulatory signaling molecules Ptpn6, Ms4a1, and Cd52, is identified playing the key role in the IPIT via single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, such IPIT availably assuages peritoneal effusion and PM in an orthotopic gastric cancer and metastatic model. Overall, this work offers a perspective on PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved antigen&#8208;presenting in intraperitoneal immunity and&#160;provides a configurable strategy for activating anti&#8208;DTC immunity for next&#8208;generation IPIT.

         <title>Lanmodulin&#8208;Decorated Microbes for Efficient Lanthanide Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;scaffolded lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli is developed as a simple, effective material for repeated capture and release of rare earth elements (REEs). Over 80% of four REE cations are captured, even in the presence of excess competitive ions. The material can be employed in a filtration flow&#8208;through system with a capture capacity of 11.8 &#177; 0.9 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many clean energy technologies. Yet, they are a limited resource currently obtained through carbon&#8208;intensive mining. Here, bio&#8208;scaffolded proteins serve as simple, effective materials for the recovery of REEs. Surface expression of the protein lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli, followed by freeze&#8208;drying of the microbes, yields a displayed protein material for REE recovery. Four REE cations (Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, and Tb3+) are captured efficiently, with over 80% recovery even in the presence of competitive ions at one&#8208;hundred&#8208;fold excess. Moreover, these materials are readily integrated into a filter with high capture capacity (12 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight) for the selective isolation and recovery of REEs from complex matrices. Further, the proteins in the filter remain stable over ten bind&#8208;and&#8208;release cycles and a week of storage. To improve the deployability of this filter material, a simple colorimetric assay with the dye alizarin&#8208;3&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid is incorporated. The assay can be performed in under 5 min, enabling rapid monitoring of REE recovery and filter efficiency. Overall, this low&#8208;cost, robust material will enable environmentally friendly recycling and recovery of critical elements.

         <title>STING&#8208;Activating Polymers Boost Lymphatic Delivery of mRNA Vaccine to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LNP is modified by a novel STING&#8208;activating polymer (PD) to enhance immune effect of mRNA vaccines by boosting cellular uptake and triggering robust immune activation. Optimizing the polymerization of PD significantly amplifies mRNA translation efficiency and STING&#8208;mediated immune responses, offering a powerful approach to advance mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.









Abstract
The unprecedented success of mRNA vaccines against COVID&#8208;19 has inspired scientists to develop mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, using nucleoside modified mRNA as vaccine, though evading innate immune toxicity, diminishes its therapeutic efficacy for cancers. Here, we report a polyvalent stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer (termed as PD) to bolster the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine. PD is made of tertiary amine units and conjugated with a biodegradable alkyl chain. Co&#8208;formulation of PDs bearing different number of tertiary amines with lipid materials and mRNA resulted in the lipid&#8208;like nanoparticles (PD LNPs) which effectively promoted lymphatic delivery and elicited robust immune activation via the STING signaling pathway. Notably, PD with eighteen tertiary amines (PD18) is predominant in balancing immune activity and tolerability. Subcutaneous administration of PD18 LNPs containing ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA enhanced the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cell with immune memory, leading to potent anticancer efficacy that surpassed 2&#8242;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP in both prophylactic and therapeutic cancer models. Additionally, PD18 LNP&#8208;based mRNA vaccine showed conferred resistance to cancer challenge for up to 60 days. Overall, this study offers a new perspective of using STING&#8208; activating polymer for imparting synergistic activity in mRNA vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Classifier Based on Digital DNA Strand Displacement for Disease Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) is developed for advanced molecular classification of processing multiple inputs. By minimizing oligonucleotide requirements, DDSD enables binary and multiclass molecular classification in a simplified manner. It has been successfully applied in infection diagnostics and pathogen identification using blood samples. Computing capability can be further enhanced by cascade DDSD and multiway junction DDSD.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular computing systems for biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for intelligent diagnostics. However, with the variety of feature biomarkers expanding, current molecular computing systems suffer from the use of a large number of oligonucleotides and limited encoding capability. Here, the study develops an alternative molecular computing approach termed Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) which recognizes targets and operates target valence through DNA polymerase&#8208;based extension and strand release. DDSD significantly reduced the number of used oligonucleotide species, provided robust molecular classifiers. In clinical blood samples, a 96% accuracy rate is achieved with a DDSD&#8208;based binary classifier for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections, a 100% accuracy rate is achieved with a multiclass classifier for identifying pathogen types, surpassing existing classifier systems. Moreover, DDSD can be readily expanded. Cascade DDSD is developed, enabling simultaneous computing of up to 14 valence states with a maximum valence of 25. Multiway junction DDSD is implemented to achieve high&#8208;valence computing by compact DNA nanostructures rather than split DNA computing units, reducing the potential leakage. The implementation of DDSD enhances the capability of valence&#8208;based intelligent molecular diagnostics and multiplexed biomarker detection.

         <title>Electroactive Dressing with Selective Sorption of Exudate Enables Treatment of Complicated Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive dressing (cMO/PVA) designed via a facile bilayer composite approach and charging procedure integrates selective sorption, long&#8208;term electrical stimulation therapy, and antibacterial properties simultaneously, showing an appealing application prospect for complicated wound repair.








Abstract
Exudate management and cell activity enhancement are vital to complicated wound healing. However, current exudate management dressings indiscriminately remove exudate, which is detrimental to cell activity enhancement. Herein, a novel class of electroactive bilayer (cMO/PVA) dressing is developed by constructing manganese oxide nanoneedle&#8208;clusters decorated commercial carbon cloth (MO), in situ casting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, and finally charging. Benefitting from the hierarchical nanoneedle&#8208;cluster structure of MO, abundant active sites are sufficiently exposed to achieve high area&#8208;specific capacitances (e.g., 1881.3 mF cm&#8722;2), thereby establishing the long&#8208;lasting electric field for cMO/PVA dressing. Such a unique cMO/PVA dressing can realize extraordinary selective sorption toward noxious substances over nutrient substances during exudate management. Meanwhile, its long&#8208;term electrical stimulation therapy can promote cell proliferation and migration&#160;and enhance antibacterial property. As a result, our multifunctional cMO/PVA dressing can rapidly repair full&#8208;thickness wounds in type II diabetic rats, offering an advanced strategy for the treatment of complicated wounds.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Range Interactions Between High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atoms in Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the mechanism of high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long&#8208;range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom&#160;catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual&#8208;atom catalysts that form metal&#8211;metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long&#8208;range interactions at a sub&#8208;nanometer distance (&lt;9 &#197;). The synergistic effect between the long&#8208;range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by &#8776;40% at high rates compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts. The resulting lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Efficient Spin&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Tunable Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are reported with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in films and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in spin&#8208;LEDs in the red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum region. Spectroscopic studies show that the CPL and CPEL originate from an energy and spin funnel process in the chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites.








Abstract
Spin light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are important for spin&#8208;based electronic circuits as they convert the carrier spin information to optical polarization. Recently, chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) has emerged as a new paradigm to enable spin&#8208;LED as it does not require any magnetic components and operates at room temperature. However, CISS&#8208;enabled spin&#8208;LED with tunable wavelengths ranging from red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) has yet to be demonstrated. Here, chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are developed to fabricate efficient spin&#8208;LEDs with tunable wavelengths from red to NIR region by tuning the halide composition. The optimized chiral perovskite films exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence from 675 to 788&#160;nm, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 86% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) ranging from 8.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2. More importantly, direct circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is achieved at room temperature in spin&#8208;LEDs. This work demonstrated efficient red and NIR spin&#8208;LEDs with the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaching 12.4% and the electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (gEL) ranging from 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 1.48 &#215; 10&#8722;2 at room temperature. The composition&#8208;dependent CPEL performance is further attributed to the prolonged spin lifetime as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>Nucleation&#8208;Controlled Crystallization of Chiral 2D Perovskite Single Crystal Thin Films for High&#8208;Sensitivity Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleation&#8208;controlled strategy is developed, to grow Dion&#8722;Jacobson phase 2D chiral perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs), from water&#8208;air interface, with a novel chiral ligand, (R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;Aminopyrrolidine. The obtained ultrathin SCTFs, with shortened spacing between inorganic layers, exhibit reduced exciton binding energy and enhanced carrier transport. In results, photodetectors based on the SCTFs show superior sensitivity to the circularly polarized light.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) chiral perovskite materials exhibit significant promise for developing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors. However, the inherently thick nature of DJ&#8208;phase 2D perovskite single crystal limits their ability to differentiate CPL photons with the two opposite polarization states. In addition, the growth of DJ&#8208;phase perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs) has proven challenging due to the strong interlayer electronic coupling. Here, a nucleation&#8208;controlled strategy is employed to grow a novel DJ&#8208;phase perovskite [(R/S)&#8208;3APr]PbI4 [(R/S)&#8208;3APr = (R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;Aminopyrrolidine] SCTFs with large area, low thickness and hence high aspect ratios. Structural and photoluminescence analyses reveal that introducing the divalent organic cations into the perovskite framework reduce the interlayer distance, resulting in low exciton binding energy. This facilitates charge separation and transport. The resulting SCTF photodetector showcases excellent detection performance with anisotropy factor for photocurrent as high as 0.65, responsivity of 1.97 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 5.3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and 3&#8208;dB frequency of 2940&#160;Hz, demonstrating its potential as a promising candidate for CPL&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. This novel approach, therefore, provides a framework for the growth of DJ&#8208;phase perovskite SCTFs and advances their applications in sensitive CPL photodetection.

         <title>Influence of Free Space on Lithium Growth Behavior at Open Surfaces and Internal Cracks of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium growth follows two modes within the crack of argyrodite sulfide solid electrolyte: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the free space inside the crack.








Abstract
Lithium dendrite penetration through solid electrolyte has been the major obstacle for practical sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Herein, a series of tailored model solid cells are designed to investigate the intrinsic lithium growth behavior at open surfaces and internal cracks of sulfide solid electrolyte. It is shown that when plating lithium on the open surface of electrolyte (free space), the lithium exhibits an intrinsic columnar growth behavior perpendicular to the electrolyte surface, preferentially along the (110) crystal&#160;axis. When plating lithium within the internal cracks (confined free space), the growth of lithium follows two major modes: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the confined free space inside the crack. The extent of lithium ingress into electrolyte under external pressure in the initial state is found to determine the rate of lithium infiltration after applying the current. As a further validation, intact sintered electrolytes with 99% relative density minimize initial lithium ingress, enabling lithium plating at 6.37&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal capacity exceeding 76 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 without short circuit.

     alt="Influence of Free Space on Lithium Growth Behavior at Open Surfaces and Internal Cracks of Sulfide-Based Solid Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium growth follows two modes within the crack of argyrodite sulfide solid electrolyte: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side-wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side-wall surface toward the free space inside the crack.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium dendrite penetration through solid electrolyte has been the major obstacle for practical sulfide-based all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Herein, a series of tailored model solid cells are designed to investigate the intrinsic lithium growth behavior at open surfaces and internal cracks of sulfide solid electrolyte. It is shown that when plating lithium on the open surface of electrolyte (free space), the lithium exhibits an intrinsic columnar growth behavior perpendicular to the electrolyte surface, preferentially along the (110) crystal&#160;axis. When plating lithium within the internal cracks (confined free space), the growth of lithium follows two major modes: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side-wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side-wall surface toward the confined free space inside the crack. The extent of lithium ingress into electrolyte under external pressure in the initial state is found to determine the rate of lithium infiltration after applying the current. As a further validation, intact sintered electrolytes with 99% relative density minimize initial lithium ingress, enabling lithium plating at 6.37&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an areal capacity exceeding 76 mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; without short circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Inter&#8208;Relation Analysis Via Graph Theory Predicts Macrophage Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory modeling of RGD nano inter&#8208;relation inversely proportional to the shortest path distance and proportional to the corresponding number of possible instances is harnessed. RGD nano inter&#8208;relation can be regulated by modulating the aspect ratio of magnetic nanobars, which can be increased by unidirectionally aligning or reversibly lifting magnetic nanobars, thereby promoting integrin&#8208;bearing filopodia penetration and adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages.








Abstract
Graph theory has been widely used to quantitatively analyze complex networks of molecules, materials, and cells. Analyzing the dynamic complex structure of extracellular matrix can predict cell&#8208;material interactions but has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, graph theory&#8208;based mathematical modeling of RGD ligand graph inter&#8208;relation is demonstrated by differentially cutting off RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages with flexibly conjugated magnetic nanobars (MNBs) with tunable aspect ratio. The RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages are less effectively cut off by MNBs with a lower aspect ratio, which decreases the shortest path while increasing the number of instances thereof, thereby augmenting RGD nano inter&#8208;relation. This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro&#8208;regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho&#8208;associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre&#8208;aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter&#8208;relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano&#8208;spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano&#8208;engineering.

         <title>Nanomagnetism Triggering Carriers Double&#8208;Resistance Conduction and Excellent Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomagnetism&#8208;triggered double&#8208;resistance conduction greatly enhances thermoelectric performance of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy films with a maximum zT of 1.44 at 320 K, providing insights into magnetism&#8208;enhanced thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Nanomagnetism may enable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient to be decoupled and can potentially lead to remarkable enhancements in thermoelectric (TE) performance, however, their physical mechanisms have not been explored. Herein, it is shown that the nanomagnetism from Fe and Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy flexible films can lead to the carriers splitting into spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down conductive branches with different resistances and mobilities due to the exchange interaction between the spin of carriers and the nanomagnetism. The double&#8208;resistance conduction of carriers may well explain the decoupling of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and their simultaneous enhancements in the thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;magnetic flexible films. It is further shown that the maximum dimensionless figure of merit of the thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;magnetic flexible films reaches between 1.2 and 1.4 at room temperature, and their five&#8208;level cascaded device based on the films achieves a temperature drop of 3.1 K through in&#8208;plane heat dissipation, making a new record for printing flexible TE films and devices. The double&#8208;resistance conduction of carriers also reveals a deep physical mechanism for magneto&#8208;enhanced TE performance of bulk thermoelectrics.

         <title>Oriented Cortical&#8208;Bone&#8208;Like Silk Protein Lamellae Effectively Repair Large Segmental Bone Defects in Pigs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk proteins can be fabricated into large scaffolds with cortical&#8208;bone&#8208;like lamellar structures through freeze&#8208;casting. The resultant freeze&#8208;cast scaffolds are made of parallel silk protein lamellae and can be implanted into pig models to achieve effective bone regeneration without side effects.









Abstract
Assembling natural proteins into large, strong, bone&#8208;mimetic scaffolds for repairing bone defects in large&#8208;animal load&#8208;bearing sites remain elusive. Here this challenge is tackled by assembling pure silk fibroin (SF) into 3D scaffolds with cortical&#8208;bone&#8208;like lamellae, superior strength, and biodegradability through freeze&#8208;casting. The unique lamellae promote the attachment, migration, and proliferation of tissue&#8208;regenerative cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] and human umbilical vein endothelial cells) around them, and are capable of developing in vitro into cortical&#8208;bone organoids with a high number of MSC&#8208;derived osteoblasts. High&#8208;SF&#8208;content lamellar scaffolds, regardless of MSC inoculation, regenerated more bone than non&#8208;lamellar or low&#8208;SF&#8208;content lamellar scaffolds. They accelerated neovascularization by transforming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, promoting bone regeneration to repair large segmental bone defects (LSBD) in minipigs within three months, even without growth factor supplements. The bone regeneration can be further enhanced by controlling the orientation of the lamella to be parallel to the long axis of bone during implantation. This work demonstrates the power of oriented lamellar bone&#8208;like protein scaffolds in repairing LSBD in large animal models.

         <title>Advancing Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Semiconductors with Organic Radical Charge Transfer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors are constructed in organic radical cocrystals by a simple solution&#8208;process method. It is suggested that the primary sources of the boosting in magnetic and electrical properties are the enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer interactions induced by radicals.








Abstract
Developing purely organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors has been a long&#8208;sought goal in the material community toward the simultaneous control of spin and charge. Organic cocrystals, known for their structural versatility and multifunctionality, are ideal candidates for these magnetoelectric coupling applications. However, organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor cocrystals have rarely been reported, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the complexity of cocrystal structures. Here, doping organic cocrystals with radicals offers a promising strategy for boosting their magnetism and conductivity while maintaining their cocrystal structures. The fluoranthene&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane radical (FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226;) is constructed through a simple, rapid, and eco&#8208;friendly solution&#8208;processing approach. The conductive FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226; exhibits excellent room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism with the coercive fields of 96 Oe and the Curie temperature near 400 K, superior to its structural&#8208;identical undoped counterpart. Meanwhile, the room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is demonstrated in the conductive FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226;. The stronger ferromagnetism and conductivity in organic cocrystals are attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions induced by radicals, rather than the spin exchange interactions between these radicals alone. The research manifests the origin of ferromagnetism in organic cocrystals and provides a simple strategy to fabricate pure organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor materials for future integrated magnetoelectric devices.

The research manifests the origin of ferromagnetism in organic cocrystals and provides a simple strategy to fabricate pure organic room-temperature magnetic semiconductor materials for future integrated magnetoelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Scintillation Performance of PEA2PbBr4 Through Zn2+ and Sb3+ Interstitial Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEA2PbBr4 is a promising scintillator for &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection. However, its energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection is poor and the ability to discriminate nf/&#947;&#8208;rays has not been accurately reported. It is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping enhances light yield and optimizes luminescence. Improved scintillator achieves 4.84% and 5.65% energy resolution at 662 keV and effective discrimination in &#947;&#8208;rays/nf detection.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide 2D perovskite single crystals have recently emerged as promising scintillators for gamma (&#947;) rays and fast neutrons (nf) detection. However, their energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection still significantly lags behind that of perovskite semiconductor detectors. Improving crystal defects and enhancing light yield to optimize light output detected by the photomultiplier tube are crucial strategies for addressing this issue. Herein, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ cation interstitial doping strategy can effectively reduce internal defects within the phenylethylammonium lead bromide (PEA2PbBr4) crystal by regulating lattice expansion. This approach also suppresses light loss caused by exciton&#8208;exciton annihilation and accelerates electron&#8208;hole recombination processes, optimizing both the luminescence intensity and decay lifetime of the scintillator. The Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping PEA2PbBr4 scintillator achieve an optimal energy resolution of 4.84% and 5.65% at 662&#160;keV for the photopeak, respectively. Additionally, in the 241Am&#8208;Be field, effective identification of nf and &#947;&#8208;rays around 1100 keVee is achieved using a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, with the figure of merit (FOM) being 0.85 and 1.03, respectively. This work provides a reliable new approach for optimizing the scintillation performance of 2D perovskite and promotes the application of 2D perovskite scintillator in &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection.

         <title>Giant Modulation of Magnetoresistance in a Van Der Waals Magnet by In&#8208;Plane Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the transition of magnetic interlayer coupling in a van der Waals (vdW) magnet driven by an in&#8208;plane electrical bias, leading to a significant modulation of magnetoresistance. This finding introduces a novel approach to controlling magnetization through electrical bias for spintronic applications with vdW magnets.









Abstract
Efficient magnetization control is a central issue in magnetism and spintronics. Particularly, there are increasing demands for manipulation of magnetic states in van der Waals (vdW) magnets with unconventional functionalities. However, the electrically induced phase transition between ferromagnetic&#8208;to&#8208;antiferromagnetic states without external magnetic field is yet to be demonstrated. Here, the current&#8208;induced magnetic phase transition in a vdW ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 is reported. Based on magneto&#8208;transport measurements and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that transition in the interlayer magnetic coupling occurs through vertical voltage drop between layers induced by current which is attributed to high anisotropy of the resistivity caused by the vdW gaps. Such magnetic phase transition results in giant modulation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance from 5% to 170%. The electrical tunability of the magnetic phase in Fe5GeTe2 with current&#8208;in&#8208;plane geometry opens a path for electric control of magnetic properties, expanding the ability to use vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

         <title>Building a Highly Stable Red/Near Infrared Afterglow Library with Highly Branched Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach is presented for achieving a stable red/NIR afterglow with high brightness and durability at high temperatures from branched luminogens. The advantages and universality of branched luminogen@red/near&#8208;infrared dye systems are demonstrated by varying the topological structures of the lumonigens using different numbers of branches (two to eight branches) and cores and employing dyes of different sizes.








Abstract
Achieving organic red/near infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at high temperatures is theoretically challenging because of the severe nonradiative transitions of excited triplet states with low energy gaps. This study realizes bright and persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent high&#8208;temperature resistance up to 413 K via highly efficient (&#8776;100%) phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) from rationally designed branched phosphorescence luminogens as energy donors to red/NIR dyes as acceptors, coupled with optimized aggregated structures. According to systematic investigations, the abundant internal cavities formed by the highly branched luminogens in solid states ensure dye loading and space limitation, which can considerably suppress nonradiative transitions at high temperatures, promoting a persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent stability. Moreover, 16 types of host&#8211;guest systems with varied topological structures of branched luminogens and different red/NIR dyes of various sizes confirm the universality of the strategy. This study provides an efficient approach to achieve a highly stable red/NIR afterglow.

         <title>Elucidating Thermal Decomposition Kinetic Mechanism of Charged Layered Oxide Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are rapidly advancing to confront energy and environmental challenges, but the safety of SIBs has not received enough attention. The kinetic triplet model is constructed based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations to unveil a thermal decomposition kinetic mechanism of the P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides before and after doping.








Abstract
The safety of the P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides (P2&#8208;NaxTMO2), a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), is a prerequisite for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, previous thermal runaway studies mainly focused on morphological changes resulting from gas production detection and thermogravimetric analysis, while the structural transition and chemical reactions underlying these processes are still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2&#8208;Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2&#8208;Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO&#8208;Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first&#160;and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in&#8208;depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2&#8208;NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high&#8208;safety SIBs.

         <title>Close&#8208;to&#8208;Equilibrium Crystallization for Large&#8208;Scale and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A close&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium crystallization method that enables the growth of large, high&#8208;quality single crystals is proposed. This approach uses independent units for solute supply, crystal growth, and solute recycling, ensuring the system operates at an optimized, steady&#8208;state growth point within the solubility phase diagram, maintaining consistent crystal growth even with varying perovskite growth window widths.









Abstract
The growth of large semiconductor crystals is crucial for advancing modern electronics and optoelectronics. While various crystal growth techniques have been developed for lead halide perovskites, a significant challenge remains: as crystal size increases, performance tends to deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses the inherent limitations of perovskite crystal growth by designing a novel strategy for near&#8208;equilibrium growth system to maintain optimal conditions throughout the process. The system consists of three independent units: a solution supply unit, a crystal growth unit, and a solution recycling unit, which together ensure a constant solution concentration and temperature. By systematically optimizing temperature control and solution feeding rates, large and high&#8208;quality FAPbBr3 single crystals, including a notable crystal measuring 51 &#215; 45 &#215; 10 mm3 are successfully produced. This crystal demonstrates a mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 2.83 &#215; 10&#8315;2 cm2 V&#8315;&#185; and an ultralow detection limit of 319.22 pGyair, significantly surpassing existing perovskite crystals of similar size. The approach can serve as a universal platform for the controlled synthesis of all kinds of perovskite single crystals, laying the foundations for their use in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Polydopamine&#8208;Coated NaGdF4 Nanoparticles with Ca2+ Chelation Ability for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) protect mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ischemic stroke by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating excess Ca2+. This dual action stabilizes Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents ROS&#8208;Ca2+ overload cycles, enhancing MSC survival and functionality, and ultimately improving stroke therapy outcomes.









Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. However, the survival of transplanted MSCs is often compromised by the excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions (Ca2+) in the ischemic microenvironment following blood flow occlusion. In this study, a protective strategy is developed using functional nanomaterials to escort and shield MSCs. Specifically, NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) are synthesized, featuring a NaGdF4 core coated with polydopamine (PDA) for ROS scavenging and further modified with alendronate sodium (ALD) for Ca2+ chelation. The internalization of NPANs by MSCs protected them from oxidative damage and calcium overload, thereby promoting their viability and functionality. Furthermore, NaGdF4 generated T1 signal enhancement, enabling in vivo tracking of MSCs via magnetic resonance imaging. The NPANs&#8208;treated MSCs demonstrated improved survival and migration to the ischemic region, promoting blood flow restoration and angiogenesis. These findings confirm the feasibility of employing functional nanoparticles to augment MSCs&#8208;based therapies, offering a promising strategy to improve their therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke treatment.

         <title>Bioinspired Super&#8208;Robust Conductive Hydrogels for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Tactile Perception System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by naturally oriented structures of biological tissues, it developed super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical property and anisotropic structure, and demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanical strength of the conductive hydrogels, used as flexible electrodes in triboelectric and piezoresistive device, affected both the accuracy and stability of machine learning&#8208;assisted tactile perception.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to exceptional flexibility, electrochemical property, and biocompatibility. However, the low mechanical strength can compromise their stability under high stress, making the material susceptible to fracture in complex or harsh environments. Achieving a balance between conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a critical challenge. In this study, super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels were designed and developed with highly oriented structures and densified networks, by employing techniques such as stretch&#8208;drying&#8208;induced directional assembly, salting&#8208;out, and ionic crosslinking. The hydrogels showed remarkable mechanical property (tensile strength: 17.13&#8211;142.1&#160;MPa; toughness: 50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high conductivity (30.1 S&#160;m&#8722;1), and reliable strain sensing performance. Additionally, it applied this hydrogel material to fabricate biomimetic electronic skin device, significantly improving signal quality and device stability. By integrating the device with 1D convolutional neural network algorithm, it further developed a real&#8208;time material recognition system based on triboelectric and piezoresistive signal collection, achieving a classification accuracy of up to 99.79% across eight materials. This study predicted the potential of the high&#8208;performance conductive hydrogels for various applications in flexible smart wearables, the Internet of Things, bioelectronics, and bionic robotics.

         <title>Stacked Scintillators Based Multispectral X&#8208;Ray Imaging Featuring Quantum&#8208;Cutting Perovskite Scintillators With 570 nm Absorption&#8208;Emission Shift</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy is introduced to eliminate mutual excitation in stacked scintillator detectors by rare earth ions doped quantum&#8208;cutting scintillators with a significant absorption&#8208;emission shift as the top layer. The developed detector features non&#8208;overlapping optical absorption and RL emission spectra, improving the discrimination of materials with similar densities.








Abstract
Traditional energy&#8208;integration X&#8208;ray imaging systems rely on total X&#8208;ray intensity for image contrast, ignoring energy&#8208;specific information. Recently developed multilayer stacked scintillators have enabled multispectral, large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging (FPXI), enhancing material discrimination capabilities. However, increased layering can lead to&#160;mutual excitation, which may affect the accurate discrimination of X&#8208;ray energy. This issue is tackled by proposing a novel design strategy utilizing rare earth ions doped quantum&#8208;cutting scintillators as the top layer. These scintillators create new luminescence centers via energy transfer, resulting in a significantly larger absorption&#8208;emission shift, as well as the potential to double the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and enhance light output. To verify this concept, a three&#8208;layer stacked scintillator detector is developed using ytterbium ions (Yb3+)&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) as the top layer, which offers a high PLQY of over 100% and a significant absorption&#8208;emission shift of 570&#160;nm. This configuration, CsAgCl2 and Cs3Cu2I5 as the middle and bottom layers, respectively, ensures non&#8208;overlapping optical absorption and radioluminescence (RL) emission spectra. By calculating the optimal thickness for each layer to absorb specific X&#8208;ray energies, the detector demonstrates distinct absorption differences across various energy bands, enhancing the identification of materials with similar densities.

Upon dispersing various phosphors into this polymer matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full&#8208;color room temperature phosphorescence with lifetimes of 249&#8211;590 ms, showing no obvious luminescence quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments.








Abstract
Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been well developed and utilized in various fields. However, their fast thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;quenching behavior highly limit their applications in certain harsh environments. Therefore, the preparation of materials with thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;resistant phosphorescence is greatly attractive. Compared with common water&#8208;soluble polymers, cycloolefin copolymers (COC) show outstanding hydrophobicity and higher rigidity, even at elevated temperatures, being as a promising candidate to prepare phosphorescence materials with suppressed thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;quenching behavior. Herein, a type of COC bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups is synthesized. After dispersing various phosphors into this matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full&#8208;color RTP with lifetimes of 249&#8211;590 ms. Their luminescence does not show obvious quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments. In the presence of both rigid COC matrix and rigid phosphors, the corresponding composite displays high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence performance. Even at 378 K, the composite can emit phosphorescence with a lifetime of 40&#8211;98 ms. The applications of these COC&#8208;based composites for imaging, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are thus explored.

         <title>Coaxial Direct Ink Writing of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers in 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;viscosity cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) ink and a silicone ink are prepared for coaxial direct ink writing of 3D strain sensors. The silicone shell supports the CLC core to enable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing in addition to enhancing the mechanical properties of the core. Monostable and bistable thin&#8208;shell domes are printed to demonstrate the 3D printing capabilities and mechanochromic behaviors.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) hold great promise for mechanochromic applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, smart textiles, and soft robotics, thanks to the structural color and elasticity. While CLCEs are printed via direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate free&#8208;standing films, complex 3D structures are not fabricated due to the opposing rheological properties necessary for cholesteric alignment and multilayer stacking. Here, 3D CLCE structures are realized by utilizing coaxial DIW to print a CLC ink within a silicone ink. By tailoring the ink compositions, and thus, the rheological properties, the cholesteric phase rapidly forms without an annealing step, while the silicone shell provides encapsulation and support to the CLCE core, allowing for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing of self&#8208;supported 3D structures. As a demonstration, free&#8208;standing bistable thin&#8208;shell domes are printed. Color changes due to compressive and tensile stresses can be witnessed from the top and bottom of the inverted domes, respectively. When the domes are arranged in an array and inverted, they can snap back to their base state by uniaxial stretching, thereby functioning as mechanical sensors with memory. The additive manufacturing platform enables the rapid fabrication of 3D mechanochromic sensors thereby expanding the realm of potential applications for CLCEs.

Mn/Zn co&#8208;doping in &#945;&#8208;Cu&#8322;V&#8322;O&#8327; induces local structure distortions, enhancing supercapacitor performance (Specific capacitance&#8208;1950.95&#160;Fg&#8315;&#185;; Energy density&#8208;97.54&#160;Whkg&#8315;&#185;) and cycling stability. Spin&#8208;phonon coupling and superior magnetic properties enable thermo&#8208;magnetic applications. A prototype device powers LED bulbs, demonstrating real&#8208;world energy storage potential. This work integrates energy storage and spintronics, offering a transformative approach for advanced multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Supercapacitors are rapidly gaining attention as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their superior power and energy densities. This study pioneers the investigation of Mn/Zn co&#8208;doping in &#945;&#8208;Cu&#8322;V&#8322;O&#8327; (CVO) to enhance its performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. Structural and local Structural properties of Mn/Zn co&#8208;doped CVO have been investigated through X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), revealing significant distortions that enhance supercapacitor performance. The optimized sample demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 1950.95&#160;Fg&#8722;1, energy density of 97.54&#160;Whkg&#8722;1, and enhanced capacitive retention, attributed to the unique Cu coordination environment and improved charge transfer kinetics. Temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy unveils spin&#8208;phonon coupling (SPC), particularly in VO&#8324; stretching modes, supported by magnetic measurements that shows a reduction in the N&#233;el temperature and the emergence of zero field&#8208;cooled (ZFC) exchange bias (EB). This work is the first to report the impact of local structure distortion on both supercapacitor performance and SPC in CVO, offering a novel strategy for developing high&#8208;performance energy storage materials with spintronics potential. In addition, the assembled symmetric optimized supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 93.32&#160;Whkg&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability. A prototype device incorporating the optimized CVO successfully powers eight commercial LED bulbs, demonstrating its practical application potential.

         <title>Constructing Anion Solvation Microenvironment Toward Durable High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>

The anion solvation structure is regulated by constructing a high&#8208;salt concentration microenvironment, which maintains highly oxidation&#8208;resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregation. The tailored solvation structure assists in the formation of robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, restraining the electrolyte oxidation and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at high voltage, which promotes the rate capability and cycling stability of SDIBs over 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based rechargeable batteries are some of the most promising candidates for electric energy storage with abundant sodium reserves, particularly, sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) perform advantages in high work voltage (&#8776;5.0&#160;V), high&#8208;power density, and potentially low cost. However, irreversible electrolyte decomposition and co&#8208;intercalation of solvent molecules at the electrode interface under a high charge state are blocking their development. Herein, a high&#8208;salt concentration microenvironment is created and proposed by tailoring the solvation structures of charge carriers including both cations and anions, which maintains highly oxidation&#8208;resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregates and provides a high ion conductivity. The tailored solvation structure makes a great contribution to protecting the graphite cathode from electrolyte oxidation, solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and structural degradation by constructing a robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with standout electrochemical stability. Based on this, the SDIBs achieved an excellent high&#8208;voltage cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles and the battery showed an improved rate performance with 97.4 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained at 100&#160;C. It is identified that regulating anion solvation structure is responsible for the stable interface chemistry and enhanced reaction kinetics, which provides deep insight into the compatibility design between the electrolyte and specialized charge storage in electrodes.

Room&#8208;temperature operation or high&#8208;operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low&#8208;cost and compact systems for numerous applications. A band&#8208;engineered mercury telluride colloidal quantum dot (HgTe CQD) heterojunction with suppressed dark current is developed and demonstrates sensitive thermal imaging above 250&#160;K with a resolution of 640&#160;&#215;&#160;512.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature operation or high&#8208;operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low&#8208;cost and compact systems for numerous applications. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a rising candidate to enable photodetectors to operate at HOT or room temperature and develop the next&#8208;generation infrared focal plane array (FPA) imagers. Here, band&#8208;engineered heterojunctions are demonstrated to suppress dark current with well&#8208;passivated mercury telluride (HgTe) CQDs enabling room&#8208;temperature MWIR imaging by single&#8208;pixel scanning and 640&#160;&#215;&#160;512 FPA sensitive thermal imaging above 250&#160;K. As a result, the room&#8208;temperature detectivity reaches as high as 1.26&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 Jones, and the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is as good as 25&#160;mK up to 200&#160;K.

         <title>In&#8208;device Battery Failure Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study analyzes the failure of wireless earbud batteries within their intended usage context. By examining degradations from the material to device level, it reveals that failure patterns are linked to device configuration and operating conditions. The interplay of battery materials, structural design, and microenvironmental factors like temperature gradients offer crucial insights for improving battery integration and reliability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are indispensable power sources for a wide range of modern electronic devices. However, battery lifespan remains a critical limitation, directly affecting the sustainability and user experience. Conventional battery failure analysis in controlled lab settings may not capture the complex interactions and environmental factors encountered in real&#8208;world, in&#8208;device operating conditions. This study analyzes the failure of commercial wireless earbud batteries as a model system within their intended usage context. Through multiscale and multimodal characterizations, the degradations from the material level to the device level are correlated, elucidating a failure pattern that is closely tied to the specific device configuration and operating conditions. The findings indicate that the ultimate failure mode is determined by the interplay of battery materials, cell structural design, and the in&#8208;device microenvironment, such as temperature gradients and their fluctuations. This holistic, in&#8208;device perspective on environmental influences provides critical insights for battery integration design, enhancing the reliability of modern&#160;electronics.

         <title>Vertical Memristive Crossbar Array for Multilayer Graph Embedding and Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m&#8208;CBA (vm&#8208;CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter&#8208;layer and intra&#8208;layer connections in three dimensions, vm&#8208;CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.








Abstract
Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m&#8208;CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high&#8208;dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss. This study proposes a unique graph embedding (mapping) method utilizing a fabricated vertical m&#8208;CBA (vm&#8208;CBA), where a custom&#8208;built measurement system thoroughly validated its functionality. This structure directly maps multilayer graphs into a 3D vm&#8208;CBA, accurately representing inter&#8208;layer and intra&#8208;layer connections. The practical link prediction and information scores across various real&#8208;world datasets demonstrated that vm&#8208;CBA achieved enhanced accuracy compared to conventional embeddings, even with a significantly decreased number of operations.

         <title>Ultrathin Rare&#8208;Earth Oxyhalides as High&#8208;&#954; van der Waals Layered Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin GdOX with a high dielectric constant and breakdown field strength is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated MoS2 transistor gated by monocrystalline dielectric exhibits an on/off current ratio exceeding 109 and a near&#8208;Boltzmann&#8208;limit SS, indicating their tangible applications in 2D electronics.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) dielectrics are extensively employed to enhance the performance of 2D electronic devices. However, current vdW dielectric materials still encounter challenges such as low dielectric constant (&#954;) and difficulties in synthesizing high&#8208;quality single crystals. 2D rare&#8208;earth oxyhalides (REOXs) with exceptional electrical properties present an opportunity for the exploration of novel high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics. In this study, for the first time, the synthesis of a series of van der Waals layered gadolinium oxyhalides with thicknesses down to monolayer through a space&#8208;confined vdW epitaxy approach and demonstrating their application as a single&#8208;crystalline gate dielectric is reported. It exhibits a remarkable relative dielectric constant exceeding 17 and an impressive breakdown field strength of 13.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. The 2D transistors directly gated by the REOXs layer exhibit enhanced electron mobility and a low interface trap density. An ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 109 and a near&#8208;Boltzmann&#8208;limit subthreshold swing is achieved. The superior dielectric properties, combined with the universality and scalability of the production method (e.g., millimeter&#8208;scale films are achieved), demonstrate that 2D REOXs can serve as promising gate dielectrics for 2D electronics, thereby expanding the study of high&#8208;&#954; vdW materials and potentially providing new opportunities for the development of low&#8208;power electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Type III Porous Liquids from Solid Precursors for the Removal and Conversion of Waste CO2 from CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products.









Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) have emerged as a promising class of flow porous materials, offering distinctive benefits for sustainable separation processes coupled with catalytic transformations in the chemical industry. Despite their potential, challenges remain in the realms of synthesis complexity, stability, and the strategic engineering of separation and catalytic sites. In this study, a scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors with high stability. In these Type III PLs, ZIF&#8208;8 nanocrystals are dispersed in the deep eutectic solvents formed by solid hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products under ambient conditions. This strategy advances the green production of stable and well&#8208;dispersed PLs, showing the potential of PLs in the sustainable separation and catalysis coupling system in the chemical industry.

         <title>Strain Release via Glass Transition Temperature Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Tg (glass transition temperature) regulation (TR) strategy is developed to effectively release residual strain in the perovskite film through adjusting the ratio of monomeric additives. The resulting film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and superior stability. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%) and excellent stability.








Abstract
Thermally induced tensile strain that remains in perovskite films after annealing is one of the key reasons for diminishing the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a glass transition temperature (Tg) regulation (TR) strategy is developed by introducing two polymerizable monomers, 2&#8208;(N&#8208;3&#8208;Sulfopropyl&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyl ammonium)ethyl methacrylate (SBMA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), into the perovskite layer. SBMA and HEA undergo in situ polymerization, which regulates the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. In addition, adjusting the ratio of SBMA and HEA to lower the Tg of the resulting polymer effectively releases the strain in the perovskite film. The modified film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and improved stability. As a result, the optimized PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%). Furthermore, the encapsulated device demonstrates prominent enhanced operation stability, maintaining 90.3% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of continuous sunlight exposure.

         <title>Fluid Control of Dip Coating for Efficient Large&#8208;Area Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dip coating is employed to fabricate large&#8208;area organic solar cells. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the correlation among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer is revealed. Consequently, the dip&#8208;coated 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit the efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively.








Abstract
As a classical low&#8208;cost technique, dip coating has not been used for printable electronics. Here, the study demonstrates large&#8208;area organic solar cells can be made by dip coating. The correlation is revealed among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer; the relationship is also expounded between fluid mechanics of the confined liquid in polymer scaffold and the continuity of the acceptor phase. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the ideal nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network forms. As a result, the 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Moreover, the method for predicting the optimal coating speed for the dip coating of given inks is proposed. Overall, this work not only demonstrates the superiority of dip coating for organic solar cell fabrication but also provides guidance for its application in printable electronics.

         <title>Observation of Real&#8208;Time Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Driven Dynamics in Antiferromagnetic Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic dynamics in nanometer&#8208;thick LaFeO&#8323; films is unveiled using time&#8208;resolved Kerr effect, demonstrating ultra&#8208;low damping and spin&#8208;orbit torque manipulation. This study provides an experimental validation of theoretical predictions, offering new insights into nanoscale spintronic systems. The exceptional material quality enables precise probing of dynamics, bridging the gap between antiferromagnetic materials and practical applications in ultrafast spintronics.








Abstract
In the burgeoning field of spintronics, antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) are attracting significant attention for their potential to enable ultra&#8208;fast, energy&#8208;efficient devices. Thin films of AFMs are particularly promising for practical applications due to their compatibility with spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms. However, studying these thin films presents challenges, primarily due to the weak signals they produce and the rapid dynamics driven by SOT, that are too fast for conventional electric transport or microwave techniques to capture. The time&#8208;resolved magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect (TR&#8208;MOKE) has been a successful tool for probing antiferromagnetic dynamics in bulk materials, thanks to its sub&#8208;picosecond (sub&#8208;ps) time resolution. Yet, its application to nanometer&#8208;scale thin films has been limited by the difficulty of detecting weak signals in such small volumes. In this study, the first successful observation of antiferromagnetic dynamics are presented in nanometer&#8208;thick orthoferrite films using the pump&#8208;probe technique to detect TR&#8208;MOKE signal. This paper report an exceptionally low damping constant of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 and confirms the AFM magnonic nature of these dynamics through angular&#8208;dependent measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that electrical currents can potentially modulate these dynamics via SOT. The&#160;findings lay the groundwork for developing tunable, energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation spintronic applications.

         <title>High Entropy Fine&#8208;Tuning Achieves Fast Li+ Kinetics in High&#8208;Performance Co&#8208;Free High&#8208;Ni Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an efficient and versatile high&#8208;entropy doping strategy. The synergistic effect between high&#8208;entropy dopant elements is optimized by compositional fine&#8208;tuning to overcome the kinetic hysteresis and high reactivity problems that have hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. Excellent long&#8208;cycle stability under fast charging and discharging conditions is achieved.








Abstract
Co&#8208;free high&#8208;Ni layered cathode materials LiNixMeyO2 (Me = Mn, Mg, Al, etc.) are a key part of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low cost. However, the hindered Li+ kinetics and the high reactivity of Ni4+ result in poor rate performance and unsatisfied cycling stability. This work designs a promising strategy for designing a high&#8208;performance high&#8208;entropy doping Co&#8208;free high&#8208;Ni layered cathode LiNi0.9Mn0.03Mg0.02Ta0.02Mo0.02Na0.01O2 (HE&#8208;Ni90&#8208;1.557) by elemental screening and compositional fine&#8208;tuning.

&lt;p&gt;This work provides an efficient and versatile high-entropy doping strategy. The synergistic effect between high-entropy dopant elements is optimized by compositional fine-tuning to overcome the kinetic hysteresis and high reactivity problems that have hindered the development of Co-free Ni-rich cathode materials. Excellent long-cycle stability under fast charging and discharging conditions is achieved.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-free high-Ni layered cathode materials LiNi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Me = Mn, Mg, Al, etc.) are a key part of the next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low cost. However, the hindered Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; kinetics and the high reactivity of Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; result in poor rate performance and unsatisfied cycling stability. This work designs a promising strategy for designing a high-performance high-entropy doping Co-free high-Ni layered cathode LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HE-Ni90-1.557) by elemental screening and compositional fine-tuning. Compositional fine-tuning optimizes the synergistic relationship between the high-entropy dopant elements, thereby significantly suppresses the kinetic hysteresis induced by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mixing. The pillar effect significantly enhances the diffusion kinetics of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the high state of charge (SOC).

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Thermophoretic Nanomotors for Superficial Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherical core&#8208;shell nanomotor consisting of a polydopamine&#8208;indocyanine green composite shell and a rigid functional core is proposed in this work. This motor can be activated by the NIR&#8208;I irradiation to perform NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed thermoplastic propulsion in subcutaneous tissue, enabling an efficient peritumoral administration for low&#8208;risk superficial tumor photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Peritumoral subcutaneous injection has been highly envisioned as an efficient yet low&#8208;risk administration of photothermal agents for superficial tumor photothermal therapy. However, obstructed by complex subcutaneous tissue, the delivery of injected photothermal agents to the specific tumor remains a critical issue. Herein, the study reports a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated spherical core/shell nanomotor with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) immobilized on its PDA shell. Upon the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) irradiation, this motor can generate favorable photothermal heat, and meantime, emit a robust ICG fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II). The heat turns the motor into an active photothermal agent able to perform thermophoretic propulsion along the irradiation direction in subcutaneous tissue, while the ICG fluorescence can direct the subcutaneous propulsion of motors toward specific tumor through real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II imaging. These functions endow the motor with the ability of moving to tumor after being injected at peritumoral site, enabling an enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT). The results demonstrated herein suggest an integrated nanorobotic tool for the superficial PTT using peritumoral administration, highlighting an NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed subcutaneous propulsion.

         <title>Synergistically Enhanced Co&#8208;Adsorption of Reactant and Hydroxyl on Platinum&#8208;Modified Copper Oxide for High&#8208;Performance HMF Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Pt/CuO@CF catalyst is designed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF at high concentrations with excellent recyclability. Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that Pt modification enhances interfacial active sites, strengthens Pt&#8208;CuO coupling, induces charge redistribution, and adjusts the d&#8208;band structure. These changes effectively improve the adsorption of reactants and hydroxyl groups, contributing to the highly efficient HMFOR.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an environmentally friendly route for producing the sustainable polymer monomer 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Thus, precisely adjusting the synergistic adsorption among key reactive species, such as HMF and OHads, on the carefully designed catalyst surface is essential for achieving satisfactory catalytic performance for HMF oxidation to FDCA as it is closely related to the adsorption strength and configuration of the reaction substrates. This kind of regulation will ultimately facilitate the improvement of HMF oxidation performance. In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified CuO nanowires (denoted as Pt/CuO@CF) are constructed for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA under alkaline conditions. The well&#8208;designed Pt/CuO@CF demonstrates highly impressive catalytic performance across a range of HMF concentrations, ranging from the commonly used concentrations to higher levels typically not explored (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100&#160;mm) with high FEFDCA (all above 95%) and outstanding long&#8208;term stability (15 cycles). In situ experimental characterizations confirm that the designed heterogeneous interface between Pt and CuO enhances the enrichment of HMF and OHads species on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations reveal the anchored Pt nanoparticles reduce the adsorption barrier for HMF and OHads, thereby promoting the highly selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA.

         <title>Angstrom Confinement&#8208;Triggered Adaptive Spin State Transition of CoMn Dual Single Atoms for Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) CoMn dual single atoms within the carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate for water purification. The angstrom&#8208;confined strategy leads to the adaptive change of atomic spin state, and reduces the energy barrier for *SO5 formation and *O2 desorption during singlet oxygen generation, enabling a 38.6&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen production compared to the surface unconfined one.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in the transformation from peroxymonosulfate to singlet oxygen, adaptive tuning of atomic spin state as the peroxymonosulfate structure varied is crucial. The angstrom confinement can effectively tune spin state, but developing an adaptive angstrom&#8208;confined atomic system is challenging. Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) dual single atoms within flexible 2D carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to drive adaptive tuning of spin state by changing atomic coordination under angstrom confinement. The in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed that medium&#8208;spin Co in Co&#9472;N4 absorbed electrons after the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate on CoMn dual single&#8208;atom sites and then cleaved O&#9472;H of peroxymonosulfate to facilitate *SO5 generation, while the introduction of *SO5 increased interlayer distance and then cleaved Co&#9472;N and Mn&#9472;N, resulting in the spin state transition from medium to high. Subsequently, the high&#8208;spin Co and Mn in Co&#9472;N2 and Mn&#9472;N2 desorbed the *O2 from *SO5, restoring the initial medium spin state. The adaptive spin state transition enhanced 38.6&#8208;fold singlet oxygen yield compared to the unconfined control. The proposed angstrom&#8208;confined diatomic strategy is applicable to serial diatomic catalysts, providing an efficient and universal design scheme for singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated selective wastewater treatment technology at the atomic level.

         <title>Stepwise Coordination Engineering of Pt1/Au25 Dual Catalytic Sites with Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of constructing heterogeneous catalysts with high metal loading, precise structures, and stability are overcome by proposing a stepwise targeted coordination engineering strategy. This approach allows for the co&#8208;anchoring of Pt single atoms and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters on g&#8208;C3N4 and the resulting dual&#8208;site catalysts demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reduction capabilities and enhanced stability throughout the catalytic process.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;site catalysts hold significant promise for accelerating complex electrochemical reactions, but a major challenge remains in balancing high loading with precise dual&#8208;site architecture to achieve optimal activity, stability, and specificity simultaneously. Herein, a strategy of stepwise targeted coordination engineering is introduced to co&#8208;anchor Pt single atoms (Pt1, 1.41&#160;wt.%) and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters (Au25, 18.92 wt.%) with high loadings on graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This approach ensures that Pt1 and Au25 occupy distinct surface sites on the g&#8208;C3N4 substrate, providing excellent stability and unprecedented electrochemical activity. In the catalysis of As(III), a sensitivity of 8.32 &#181;A ppb&#8722;1 is achieved, more than double the previously reported values under neutral conditions. The enhanced detection limit (0.2&#160;ppb) is crucial for monitoring water quality and protecting public health from arsenic contamination, a significant environmental and health risk. Furthermore, the formation of Pt&#9472;As and As&#9472;S bonds facilitates the easier breakage of As&#9472;O bonds, thereby lowering the reaction barrier energy of the rate&#8208;determining step and significantly enhancing arsenious acid catalysis efficiency. These results not only offer an intriguing strategy for constructing highly efficient heterogeneous dual&#8208;site catalysts but also reveal the atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms that drive enhanced catalytic efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of constructing heterogeneous catalysts with high metal loading, precise structures, and stability are overcome by proposing a stepwise targeted coordination engineering strategy. This approach allows for the co-anchoring of Pt single atoms and Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SG)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters on g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the resulting dual-site catalysts demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reduction capabilities and enhanced stability throughout the catalytic process.

         <title>ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb): New Mn&#8208;Based 2D Magnetoplumbites with Geometric and Magnetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbites, ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb), are discovered, synthesized, and characterized. According to magnetic properties measurements, neutron diffraction, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, short&#8208;range magnetic correlations are observed in the new materials. These observations reveal 2D magnetic correlations and magnetic frustration in ASb3Mn9O19, making it a promising platform for inducing exotic quantum states.








Abstract
Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration is rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, the discovery, synthesis, and characterization of the first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb) are reported. The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular, and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin&#8211;spin coupling as well as multiple low&#8208;temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data does not show any prominent &#955;&#8208;anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) implied the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks are observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering is seen in the NPD patterns of both compounds at low angles and is analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short&#8208;range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as 2D magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

         <title>A Bifunctional Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimera Nanoplatform for Tumor&#8208;Selective Protein Degradation and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera nanoplatform (NLTC) is synthesized for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling surface properties and encapsulating catalase, NLTC can efficiently accumulate at tumor tissues and avoid on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity, synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) and relieve immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane&#8208;associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation&#8208;independent mannose 6&#8208;phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue&#8208;selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.

         <title>Superstrong Lightweight Aerogel with Supercontinuous Layer by Surface Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 fiber aerogel with a supercontinuous nanolayer is developed for high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation. The supercontinuous arrangement of ultra&#8208;fine ZrO2 grains on the aerogel surface enables close connections between grains and fibers, promoting efficient transmission of mechanical and thermal stresses, which contributes to record&#8208;high specific strength and remarkable thermal&#8208;insulating behaviors.








Abstract
Breaking the thermal, mechanical and lightweight performance limit of aerogels has pivotal significance on thermal protection, new energy utilization, high&#8208;temperature catalysis, structural engineering, and physics, but is severely limited by the serious discrete characteristics between grain boundary and nano&#8208;units interfaces. Herein, a thermodynamically driven surface reaction and confined crystallization process is reported to synthesize a centimeter&#8208;scale supercontinuous ZrO2 nanolayer on ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 fiber aerogel surface, which significantly improved its thermal and mechanical properties with density almost unchanged (&#8776;26 mg&#160;cm&#8722;3). Systematic structure analysis confirms that the supercontinuous layer achieves a close connection between grains and fibers through Zr&#9472;O&#9472;Si bonds. The as&#8208;prepared aerogel exhibits record&#8208;breaking specific strength (&#8776;84615 N&#160;m&#160;kg&#8722;1, can support up to &#8776;227&#160;272 times aerogel mass) and dynamic impact resistance (withstanding impacts up to 500 times aerogel mass and up to 200 cycling stability at 80% strain). Besides, its temperature resistance has also been greatly optimized (400&#160;&#176;C enhancement, stability at 1500&#160;&#176;C). This work will provide a new perspective for exploring the limits of lightweight, high strength, and thermal properties of solid materials.

         <dc:description>
A particle&#8208;polymer coalescence strategy is proposed to build balanced particle cohesion, successfully realizing the bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement slurry for weaving. Beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formwork casting, grouting, and 3D&#8208;printing, this cement weaving technology may invoke the construction technology revolution and new material and structure design.








Abstract
Weaving, a pivotal technique in human construction activities since the Neolithic era, remains unattainable in modern concrete construction. Here, a novel particle&#8208;polymer coalescence strategy is proposed, which involves electrostatic, bridging, coordinating, and hydrogen bonding interactions, to establish balanced particle cohesion, enabling the fabrication of stretchable cement slurry. The bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement filaments for structural textiles is successfully realized beyond traditional formwork casting, grouting, and 3D&#8208;printing, and fabricate the first&#8208;ever Chinese knot woven with cement. Weaving construction builds a triaxially cross&#8208;penetrating structure that greatly promotes interlayer strength and toughness by &#8776;208.5% and 676.5% compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer 3D printed structure. These findings not only make a breakthrough in concrete construction technology but also provide solutions for fabricating multi&#8208;directional woven structures with great engineering&#8208;application potentials.

         <title>Embedding Carbon Nanotubes in Artificial Cells Enhances Probe Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes and carbon nanotubes are embedded in the artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular probe transduction and mass transfer. The strategy accelerates cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enables effective sensing of let&#8208;7a and visualizing let&#8208;7a in living colon cancer cells.








Abstract
Monitoring intracellular biomarkers is crucial for clinical disease diagnosis. However, the majority of signaling molecules face difficulties in slow transference across the cell membrane to reach intracellular detection sites, limiting their application in clinical settings. This study proposes an artificial cell&#8208;based signal probe transfer&#8208;enhanced sensing strategy to effectively detect microRNAs (miRNAs) by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in artificial cell membranes. The liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes such as nucleic acids, metal ions, and fluorescent dyes. CNTs are embedded in artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular signal probe transduction and mass transfer. Through CNTs&#8208;mediate cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission, the probes pass through the liposome membrane interface and fuse into target cells, selectively hybridizing with the intracellular target miRNAs, triggering a sensing process and resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to prove the enhancement of CNTs&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;cell fusion. This strategy demonstrates excellent analytical performance by quantitatively detecting let&#8208;7a miRNA and visualizing it in living colon cancer cells. These findings hold great significance in promoting and accelerating cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enabling effective sensing of intracellular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

         <title>Dielectric Regulation in Quasi&#8208;vdW Europium Oxysulfur Compounds by Compositional Engineering for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first synthesis of 2D hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; with tunable dielectric properties. Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; offers high dielectric performance, while Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; provides a wider bandgap. Integrated into MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistors, these materials demonstrate excellent performance, highlighting their potential as multifunctional dielectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
Advancing next&#8208;generation electronics necessitates precise control of dielectric properties in 2D materials. Here, the first synthesis of novel 2D quasi&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) europium oxysulfur (Eu2SOx) compounds, comprising hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phases, with composition&#8208;tunable dielectric properties, is presented. Using a homodiffusive&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth method, materials are achieved with complementary characteristics: the hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; phase exhibits a high dielectric constant (&#8776;30) paired with a moderate bandgap (&#8776;4.56 eV), while the tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phase offers a wider bandgap (&#8776;5.62 eV) but a lower dielectric constant (&#8776;20). The potential of these materials is demonstrated by integrating ultrathin Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; nanoplates with molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322;) field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) via vdW forces. The resulting devices achieve a near&#8208;ideal Ion/Ioff ratio (&#8776;10&#8312;), minimal hysteresis (&#8776;5.3 mV), a low subthreshold slope (&#8776;63.5 mV dec&#8315;&#185;), and ultralow leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#185;&#8308; A). These results highlight the capacity of europium oxysulfur compounds to address the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and bandgap, offering tailored solutions for diverse 2D electronic applications. This work underscores the potential of composition engineering to expand the family of rare&#8208;earth oxysulfur compounds for nanoelectronics, paving the way for innovative gate dielectrics in next&#8208;generation devices.

         <title>Nonlinear Ion Dynamics Enable Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity of Electrochemical Ionic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical ionic synapses enable spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP) with low energy consumption and minimal variability. The approach supports diverse STDP forms and flexible learning rules across timescales from milliseconds to nanoseconds, enabling spiking neural network hardware with high throughput and adaptability while maintaining low energy consumption and high reliability.








Abstract
Programmable synaptic devices that can achieve timing&#8208;dependent weight updates are key components to implementing energy&#8208;efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). Electrochemical ionic synapses (EIS) enable the programming of weight updates with very low energy consumption and low variability. Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre&#8208; and post&#8208;synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio&#8208;plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxide Nanoparticles: Regulation by Flame Spray Pyrolysis with Ultrafast Quenching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a continuous&#8208;flow flame spray pyrolysis method for tuning lattice strain in high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. By varying the cooling rates of quenching, tensile strain increases by 2.75%, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction performance with a 25 mV reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This approach facilitates efficient mass production and precise control of lattice strain.








Abstract
The lattice&#8208;strain engineering of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide nanoparticles (HEO&#8208;NPs) is considered an effective strategy for achieving outstanding performance in various applications. However, lattice&#8208;strain engineering independent of the composition variation still confronts significant challenges, with existing modulation techniques difficult to achieve mass production. Herein, a novel continuous&#8208;flow synthesis strategy by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is proposed, which air varying flow rates is introduced for fast quenching to alter the cooling rate and control the lattice strain of HEO&#8208;NPs. Experimental results demonstrate that as the flow rate of air increases from 0 L to 24 L min&#8722;1, the cooling rate has increased by more than ten times, and the tensile strain of the HEO&#8208;NPs increases by 2.75%. Utilizing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as an indicator, it is observed that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is reduced by 25&#160;mV. Importantly, this approach enables the simple and efficient regulation of lattice strain in HEO&#8208;NPs (110 mg min&#8722;1). Thus, this study provides a new approach for both the mass production and regulation of lattice strain in HEO&#8208;NPs.

By varying the cooling rates of quenching, tensile strain increases by 2.75%, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction performance with a 25 mV reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach facilitates efficient mass production and precise control of lattice strain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lattice-strain engineering of high-entropy-oxide nanoparticles (HEO-NPs) is considered an effective strategy for achieving outstanding performance in various applications. However, lattice-strain engineering independent of the composition variation still confronts significant challenges, with existing modulation techniques difficult to achieve mass production. Herein, a novel continuous-flow synthesis strategy by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is proposed, which air varying flow rates is introduced for fast quenching to alter the cooling rate and control the lattice strain of HEO-NPs. Experimental results demonstrate that as the flow rate of air increases from 0 L to 24 L min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the cooling rate has increased by more than ten times, and the tensile strain of the HEO-NPs increases by 2.75%. Utilizing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as an indicator, it is observed that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced by 25&#160;mV. Importantly, this approach enables the simple and efficient regulation of lattice strain in HEO-NPs (110 mg min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, this study provides a new approach for both the mass production and regulation of lattice strain in HEO-NPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Disordered Aerogel for Omnidirectional Terahertz Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking micro&#8208;pores structures from black butterflies, terahertz response behaviors with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband can be effectively controlled through a disordered pore&#8208;induced structural orientation mechanism. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of terahertz response behaviors via optimized pore structure including disorder, pore parameters, and orientation, regarding as resonance sphere and waveguide system.








Abstract
The structural disorder of the black butterfly assists in capturing sunlight across a wider spectral and angular range, injecting infinite vitality for omnidirectional and stimuli&#8208;responsive wave&#8208;absorbing materials. Here, the disordered micro&#8208;pores responding to terahertz (THz) waves through electromagnetic simulations, and then prepared via ice templating technology are analyzed and optimized. The customized disordered aerogel makes possible perfect terahertz response property with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband. Ti3C2Tx MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels realize excellent shielding effectiveness exceeding 70.32&#160;dB and reflection loss of more than 43.02&#160;dB over the frequency range of 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz. Tailoring the structural orientation of anisotropic aerogels functions as a versatile dynamic modulation approach along terahertz propagation direction. The porous structure with moderate conductivity gradually triggers the resonance effect of the cavity, approximating a resonance sphere (pore) and waveguide system (tube). Ultimately, gradient impedance aerogel is proposed integrating THz&#8208;infrared stealth, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength. This inspired biomimetic structural strategy will also enable various terahertz applications such as terahertz imaging, line&#8208;of&#8208;sight telecommunication, information encryption, and space exploration.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy Engineering in Cobalt Selenide Boosts Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyester Thermoplastics at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancies&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst to convert polybutylene terephthalate into succinic acid is crafted, which functions well at industrial&#8208;level current density (1.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.477&#160;V vs. RHE). The catalytic mechanism of catalyst and related generality of electrocatalytic upcycling of other polyester thermoplastics are investigated. This work contributes to propel current research frontier of utilization of low&#8208;value carbon resources.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed the increasing accumulation of plastics, posing a daunting environmental crisis. Among various solutions, converting plastics into value&#8208;added products presents a significant endeavor. Here, an electrocatalytic upcycling route that efficiently converts waste poly(butylene terephthalate) plastics into high&#8208;value succinic acid with high Faradaic efficiency of 94.0% over cation vacancies&#8208;rich cobalt selenide catalyst is reported, showcasing unprecedented activity (1.477&#160;V vs. RHE) to achieve an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and featuring a robust operating durability (&#8776;170&#160;h). In particular, when combining butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monomer oxidation (BOR) with hydrogen evolution using the cation vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt selenide as bifunctional catalyst, a relatively low cell voltage of 1.681&#160;V is required to reach 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, manifesting an energy&#8208;saving efficiency of &#8776;15% compared to pure water splitting. The mechanism and reaction pathways of BOR over the vacancies&#8208;rich catalyst are first revealed through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ spectroscopic investigations. The generality of this catalyst is evidenced by its powerful electrocatalytic activity to other polyester thermoplastics such as poly(butylene succinate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate). These electrocatalytic upcycling strategies can be coupled with the reduction of small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, and NO3&#8722;), shedding light on energy&#8208;saving production of value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>The Optimized Lipid&#8208;Modified Prodrug for CNV Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of SU5402 (SU)&#160;with aliphatic chains containing 20 carbon atoms (SU&#8208;C20 NPs) exhibits an exceptional ability to penetrate the ocular barrier and ensure prolonged drug retention within the eye. These optimized prodrug nanoparticles show a remarkable therapeutic effect in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in minimal hyperfluorescent leakage and the smallest CNV lesion thickness.








Abstract
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti&#8208;neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU&#8208;C12, SU&#8208;C16, SU&#8208;C20, SU&#8208;C24, SU&#8208;C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU&#8208;C12 NPs, SU&#8208;C16 NPs, SU&#8208;C20 NPs, SU&#8208;C24 NPs, SU&#8208;C28 NPs. Among these, SU&#8208;C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU&#8208;C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU&#8208;C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (wAMD).

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulatory Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Flow for Building 600&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1&#8208;Level Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intra&#8208;particle pores play a practical role in cutting down the electrolyte quantity needed during wetting. A high pore&#8208;throat ratio empowers Li&#8208;rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah&#8722;1 and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg&#8722;1 in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore&#8208;based regulation in high&#8208;energy storage devices.








Abstract
Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano&#8208; or meso&#8208;pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore&#8208;throat ratio, enabling Li&#8208;rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4&#160;g Ah&#8722;1. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore&#8208;throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore&#8208;relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

A high pore-throat ratio empowers Li-rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore-based regulation in high-energy storage devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano- or meso-pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore-throat ratio, enabling Li-rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4&#160;g Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore-throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore-relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi-solid-state lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralight Electrospun Composite Filters with Vertical Ternary Spatial Network for High&#8208;Performance PM0.3 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative ultralight electrospun nanofiber composite filter,&#160;mass&#8208;produced via an one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, is engineered with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure, featuring elongated internal aperture channels. This advanced TSN filter excels in high&#8208;performance filtration of ultrafine PM0.3 aerosols,&#160;while significantly minimizing material usage. It is designed for recyclability and operates with low energy requirements, ensuring both wearer comfort and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Air pollutants, particularly highly permeable particulate matter (PM), threaten public health and environmental sustainability due to extensive filter media consumption. Existing melt&#8208;blown nonwoven filters struggle with PM0.3 removal, energy consumption, and disposal burdens. Here, an ultralight composite filter with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure that saves &#8776;98% of raw material usage and reduces fabrication time by 99.4%, while simultaneously achieving high&#8208;efficiency PM0.3 removal (&#8805;99.92%), eco&#8208;friendly regeneration (near&#8208;zero energy consumption), and enhanced wearing comfort (breathability &gt;80&#160;mm s&#8315;&#185;, infrared transmittance &gt;85%), is reported. The TSN filter consists of a hybrid layer of microspheres (average diameter &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m)/superfine nanofibers (&#8776;20&#160;nm) sandwiched between two nanofiber scaffolds (diameter &#8776;400&#160;nm and &#8776;100&#160;nm). This arrangement offers high porosity (&#8776;85%), ultralow areal density (&lt;1&#160;g m&#8722;2), alow airflow resistance (&lt;90&#160;Pa), guaranteeing superb thermal comfort. Notably, utilizing scalable one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, TSN mats can be mass&#8208;produced at a rate of 60 meters per hour (width of 1.6 meters), which is critical and verified for various applications including window screens, individual respiratory protectors, and dust collectors. This work provides a viable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance nanofiber filter media through structural regulation in a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable way.

         <title>Tailoring Buried Interface and Minimizing Energy Loss Enable Efficient Narrow and Wide Bandgap Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Aluminum Glycinate Based Organometallic Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum glycinate&#8208;based organometallic molecule is used to tailor buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy loss, which realizes high efficiencies of 26.74% and 20.71% for 1.55 and 1.785 eV bandgap perovskite solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
Rational regulation of Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface has emerged as a significant challenge in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an organometallic molecule of aluminum glycinate (AG) that contained amine (&#8208;NH2) and aluminum hydroxyl (Al&#8208;OH) groups is developed to tailor the buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy losses. The Al&#8208;OH groups selectively bonded with unanchored O&#9552;P&#8208;OH and bare NiO&#8208;OH to optimize the surface morphology and energy levels, while the &#8208;NH2 group interacted specifically with Pb2+ to retard perovskite crystallization, passivate buried Pb&#8208;related defects, and release residual interface stress. These interactions facilitate the interface carrier extraction and reduce interface&#8208;driven energy losses, thereby realizing a balanced charge carrier transport. Consequently, AG&#8208;modified narrow bandgap (1.55 eV) PSC demonstrates an efficiency of 26.74% (certified 26.21%) with a fill factor of 86.65%; AG&#8208;modified wide bandgap (1.785 eV) PSC realizes 20.71% champion efficiency with excellent repeatability. These PSCs maintain 91.37%, 91.92%, and 92.00% of their initial efficiency after aging in air atmosphere, the nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#160;&#176;C, and continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point under one&#8208;sun illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2) for 1200 h, respectively.

         <title>Constructing Pillar&#8208;Layered Covalent Organic Frameworks via Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D Pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) with adjustable interlayer spacing, enhanced crystallinity, and increased porosity are designed and constructed using a pillaring strategy via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, which demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion compared to their 2D layered COF counterparts.








Abstract
Growing global concerns over energy security and climate change have intensified efforts to develop sustainable strategies for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and abundance of active sites. However, the performance of 2D COFs is often limited by layer stacking, which restricts active site exposure and reduces selectivity. To overcome these challenges, a new class of COFs known as pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) is developed featuring adjustable interlayer spacing and a 3D architecture. Characterization using PXRD, TEM, XPS, and EIS confirmed the successful integration of pillar molecules, which leads to increased interlayer spacing, crystallinity, and porosity. These structural advancements result in significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Density functional theory simulations revealed that enhanced CO2 adsorption and CO desorption contribute to the outstanding performance of PL&#8208;COF&#8208;1, which boasts the largest interlayer spacing. This material achieved an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and demonstrated a significant current density, outperforming both the original COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and PL&#8208;COF&#8208;2. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pillaring strategy in optimizing COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials for CO2 reduction and sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Crystal Structural Editing: Novel Biaxial MgTe2O5 Crystal as Zero&#8208;Order Waveplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgTe2O5 with 0D structure has been successfully selected and grown as a waveplate crystal. The MgTe2O5 crystal shows tiny birefringence of 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5&#160;&#181;m with a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a novel waveplate crystal and excellent waveplate devices.








Abstract
Waveplates are important optical components to control the polarization of light. Currently, they are often fabricated from uniaxial crystals, and there is no report about waveplates based on the biaxial crystals. In this work, a novel biaxial crystal MgTe2O5 with a structure constructed by 0D Te2O5 groups is designed and grown as waveplate materials for the first time. The exciting result is that the birefringence in the (001)&#8208;plane is smaller than 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 &#181;m, which is significantly smaller than that of the current waveplate materials. The polarization modulations of the MgTe2O5 devices working at 532 nm indicate that excellent zero&#8208;order half and quarter waveplates have been successfully prepared. In addition, achromatic waveplates used in the visible, near&#8208;infrared, and mid&#8208;infrared ranges have also been calculated. The MgTe2O5 crystal not only exhibits a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2 but also shows a wide transmission range from 0.37 to 6.3 &#181;m. These results provide an excellent waveplate crystal and explore the applications of biaxial crystals.

&lt;p&gt;MgTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with 0D structure has been successfully selected and grown as a waveplate crystal. The MgTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; crystal shows tiny birefringence of 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5&#160;&#181;m with a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a novel waveplate crystal and excellent waveplate devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waveplates are important optical components to control the polarization of light. Currently, they are often fabricated from uniaxial crystals, and there is no report about waveplates based on the biaxial crystals. In this work, a novel biaxial crystal MgTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with a structure constructed by 0D Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; groups is designed and grown as waveplate materials for the first time. The exciting result is that the birefringence in the (001)-plane is smaller than 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 &#181;m, which is significantly smaller than that of the current waveplate materials. The polarization modulations of the MgTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; devices working at 532 nm indicate that excellent zero-order half and quarter waveplates have been successfully prepared. In addition, achromatic waveplates used in the visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared ranges have also been calculated. The MgTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; crystal not only exhibits a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; but also shows a wide transmission range from 0.37 to 6.3 &#181;m. These results provide an excellent waveplate crystal and explore the applications of biaxial crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Li&#8208;Rich Transport in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Negatively charged cation defects intensify the concentration enrichment of Li ions on the nanofiller surface, inducing the formation of interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, their widespread development has been hindered by the low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this contribution, a novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. By incorporating cation&#8208;deficient dielectric nanofillers into polymer matrices, it is found that negatively charged cation defects effectively intensify the adsorption of Li ions, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion concentration enrichment on the surface of fillers. More importantly, these formed Li&#8208;rich layers are interconnected to establish continuous ultrafast Li&#8208;ion transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibited a remarkably low ion transport activation energy (0.17&#160;eV) and achieved an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mo0.1O2 full cells demonstrated an extended cycling life of over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.7%. This work provides a fresh insight into improving Li&#8208;ion transport by constructing interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance SSLMBs.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Achieved in Spinel Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>

Synopsis: Utilizing a 2D framework matrix, a strategy is presented to balance Cr3&#8314;&#8208;pair emissions at high doping concentrations while effectively suppressing undesirable quenching, thereby ensuring sustained luminescent efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared emitters related to Cr3+&#8208;pairs for advanced optoelectronic devices remains a challenge due to concentration quenching effects and unclear luminescence mechanisms. In this study, Cr3+ ions are incorporated into a matrix structure consisting of ZnAl&#8322;O&#8324; spinel units separated by 11.312 &#197;, effectively restricting energy transfer between luminescent centers and alleviating quenching effects. Computational analysis identifies the lattice positions of isolated Cr3+ ions and Cr3+&#8208;pairs at different doping levels, providing insights into their spatial distribution and local structural environments. Photoluminescence measurements reveals a Cr3+&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent emission broadening, with a Cr3+&#8208;pair emission band peak at 750&#160;nm, while detailed spectral analysis further clarified the energy level structure of Cr3+&#8208;pairs for the first time. Enhanced material performance is achieved through flux&#8208;assisted synthesis, reaching a high external quantum efficiency of 58.3%. Consequently, the assembled pc&#8208;LEDs exhibit minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off and achieve&#160;a high output of 183&#160;mW at 650&#160;mA, demonstrating their potential in near&#8208;infrared light sources and night vision technology application.

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Encapsulated in Hierarchical Porous Bio&#8208;Carbon Synergistically Enhances Fast Iodine Conversion and Efficient Polyiodide Confinement for Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;derived carbon integrated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts for iodine hosting is designed, integrating the high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping of carbon, along with the excellent chemical confinement and electrocatalytic properties of Zn single atoms. This enabled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries to achieve a long lifespan of 80&#160;000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 93.6% capacity retention.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and high specific capacity. However, their development is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polyiodides and the slow redox conversion kinetics of the iodine (I2) cathode. Herein, a long&#8208;life Zn&#8208;I2 battery is developed by anchoring iodine within an edible fungus slag&#8208;derived carbon matrix encapsulated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAZn@CFS). The high N content and microporous structure of SAZn@CFS provide a strong iodine confinement, while the Zn&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites chemical interact with polyiodides effectively mitigating the iodine dissolution and the polyiodide shuttle effect. Additionally, the uniformly distributed SAZn sites significantly enhance the redox conversion efficiency of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I5&#8722;/I2, leading to improved capacity. At a high current density of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, the designed Zn&#8208;I2 battery delivers an excellent capacity of 147.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a long lifespan of over 80&#160;000 cycles with 93.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, the battery exhibits stable operation for 3500 times even at 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating significant advances in iodine reversible storage. This synergistic strategy optimizes composite structure, offering a practical approach to meet the requirements of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Photoacoustic/NIR&#8208;II and Photodynamic Properties of pH&#8208;Reversible Thiopyrylium Agents: A Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents an innovative approach to developing pH&#8208;responsive thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with enhanced photoacoustic and photodynamic properties. By precisely modulating molecular aggregation, the study demonstrates significant advances in tumor&#8208;targeted dual&#8208;modal imaging and therapy, providing a promising pathway for future cancer diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based hemicyanine near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule HTPA exhibits a remarkable pH&#8208;responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium-based hemicyanine near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule &lt;b&gt;HTPA&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a remarkable pH-responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated. Additionally, their behavior and pH reversibility during aggregation formation are systematically investigated, including computational optimization, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR analysis, and single crystal analysis. Finally, an innovative &#8220;off&#8201;&#8221; nanoparticle specifically is designed for effective tumor-targeted PA/NIR-II dual-modal imaging and photodynamic therapy by utilizing a pH-responsive polymer. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of PA signals significantly increased to 169 in the region of interest (ROI) in the mouse model when irradiated at 1064&#160;nm. These findings not only provide a promising avenue for future studies of NIR-II small molecules but also pave the way for significant advances in the field of integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controllable High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward Stable Hydrogen Production at Industrial&#8208;Scale Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst capable of stable hydrogen precipitation at current densities of &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 is successfully developed with negligible activity loss over 100 h. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.








Abstract
Efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at high current densities is highly desirable for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production, which is yet challenging, because of the electrocatalyst with short lifespans during the acidic HER process. Here, a controllable preparation technique is successfully developed to synthesize PdPtRuRhAu high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) of various sizes, within the 3.14&#160;nm particles (HEA&#8208;3.14) demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance and stable hydrogen production at current densities of &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 with negligible activity loss over 100&#160;h. Theoretical calculations indicate that the bridge adsorption site of Pd&#8211;Au serves as an ideal location for HER, with HEA&#8208;3.14 possessing the highest proportion of such sites, reaching 18.97%. To further analyze the thermodynamic stability of HEAs, an element&#8208;encoding machine learning model is developed from over 300&#160;000 preprocessed dataset of HEAs that achieving an impressively low RMSE of 58.6&#160;&#176;C and a high R2 value of 0.98. By integrating thermodynamic modeling with machine learning methods, the melting point of the PdPtRuRhAu HEAs at 3.14&#160;nm (366&#160;&#176;C) is predicted, which aligns well with the results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry tests. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.

Metallic MoO3&#8208;x is successfully prepared at the kilogram scale and exhibits an outstanding STA efficiency (&#8776;0.3%) under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation. Its potential scalability of the large&#8208;scale photocatalytic system stems from a high STA efficiency (0.03%) and good stability (6 days) of the 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, yielding solar fertilizer ((NH4)2SO4).








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to convert molecular N2 into nitrogen&#8208;rich chemicals (e.g., ammonia) provides a potential pathway for the manufacture of &#8220;solar fertilizers&#8221;. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (STA) efficiency of most solar fertilizer systems developed to date is less than 0.1%. Herein, an outstanding STA efficiency of &#8776;0.3% using a metallic molybdenum trioxide (metallic MoO3&#8208;x) photocatalyst under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation is reported, with localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena in the metallic MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst enhancing both light utilization and N2 activation. The potential scalability of the photocatalytic technology is demonstrated in a 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, with a high STA efficiency and good stability demonstrated over 6 days of outdoor testing, yielding a solid (NH4)2SO4 product for easy collection. The as&#8208;designed square&#8208;meter outdoor reaction system facilitates the integration of solar fertilizer technology with existing agricultural infrastructure.

         <title>Giant Capacitive Energy&#8208;Storage in BaTiO3&#8208;Based Fine&#8208;Grained Relaxors via Local Polarization Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrial pillar Barium titanate&#8208;based bulk ceramic capacitors suffer from low energy storage density, hindering their use in advanced applications. By designing a favorable local structure and optimizing chemical composition to improve local polarization and refine grain structure, energy density above 15 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 is achieved, along with superior overall performance, overcoming the current bottleneck of this capacitor type.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;free dielectric energy storage capacitors are core components in advanced pulse&#8208;power electronic systems and devices. However, the relatively low energy density (Wrec) for the industrial pillar BaTiO3 (BT)&#8208;based capacitors remains a significant obstacle for their cutting&#8208;edge applications, due to their low intrinsic polarization and breakdown strength (EB). Herein, through chemical composition and local structure design, a giant Wrec of 15.1 J cm&#8722;3 along with a high efficiency (&#951;) of 85% is demonstrated in a BT&#8208;based relaxor bulk ceramic. This is achieved by introducing rare A&#8208;site polarization enhancement substitution (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions in combination with B&#8208;site fastest relaxation alternative (Zn1/3Nb2/3)4+ ions to enhance local polarization and refine grain structure. Atomic&#8208;level local structure analysis has revealed that the diversified atomic polar displacement vectors, characterized by largely extended magnitude and heterogeneous directions, assemble into highly polarizable clusters at several unit&#8208;cells scale. Consequently, it exerts a large polarization difference (&#916;P) of 49 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 and a high EB of 90&#160;kV mm&#8722;1. Moreover, a giant power density (677 MW cm&#8722;3), high discharge energy density (3.9 J cm&#8722;3), and excellent stability are achieved. This study overcomes the current Wrec bottleneck of &#8776;10 J cm&#8722;3 in BT&#8208;based bulk ceramics, presenting an approach to optimize the energy storage performance of Pb&#8208;free relaxors.

Abstract
Direct ink writing is a 3D printing method that is compatible with a wide range of structural, elastomeric, electronic, and living materials, and it continues to expand its uses into physics, engineering, and biology laboratories. However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. This work introduces a compact, low&#8208;cost, multimaterial, and high&#8208;throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low&#8208;cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Active mixing of cell&#8208;laden bioinks, high&#8208;throughput production of auxetic lattices using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, and a high&#8208;toughness, photocurable hydrogel for fabrication of heart valves are introduced. Finally, hardware for embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle printing is developed for producing high&#8208;throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, simple&#8208;to&#8208;build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.

         <title>Stretchable Blue Phase Liquid Crystal Lasers with Optical Stability Based on Small&#8208;Strain Nonlinear 3D Asymmetric Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;peak stretchable BPLC laser is fabricated based on partially and fully crosslinked networks due to the slow variation of lattice orientation under small strains. The laser exhibits a tuning range of 44.429&#160;nm at 32% strain, providing stable output over a broad&#8208; temperature range with 3D circularly polarized emission under small strains, presenting the potential applications in 3D mechanical perception.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers exhibit exceptional optical quality and tunability to external stimuli, holding significant promise for innovative developments in the field of flexible optoelectronics. However, there remain challenges for BPLC elastomer (BPLCE) lasers in maintaining good optical stability during stretching and varying temperature conditions. In this work, a stretchable laser is developed based on a well&#8208;designed BPLCE with a combination of partially and fully crosslinked networks, which can output a single&#8208;peak laser under small deformation (44.429&#160;nm lasing shift at 32% strain) and a broad&#8208;temperature range (from &#8722;20 to 100&#160;&#176;C). The superior performance can be attributed to the nonlinear 3D asymmetric deformation exhibited by the BPI lattice during stretching, particularly at low deformation rates below 40% strain, which effectively maintains the stability of the body&#8208;centered cubic structure (with the maximum strain of this BPLCE up to 220%). Moreover, the BPLCE exhibits excellent thermal stability over a temperature range from &#8722;180 to 70&#160;&#176;C with a stopband shift of less than &#177;10&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the application of BPLCE laser for morphology sensing and 3D mechanical perception is demonstrated, which paves the way for potential applications of flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation of Organic n&#8208;Type Dopants for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional regulation strategy of organic dopants is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells. Selenium has a strong electron&#8208;donating ability, which can transfer electrons to perovskites. Specially, 2D&#8208;perylene diimide can coat the perovskite crystal to form a lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states, improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency, and restrains ion migration.








Abstract
A strong n&#8208;type perovskite layer is crucial in achieving high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells, as the weak n&#8208;type perovskites result in a loss of VOC, and the p&#8208;type perovskites contain numerous electron traps that cause the severe carrier recombination. Here, three types of perylene diimide (PDI) based small molecule dopants with different dimensions, including 1D&#8208;PDI, 2D&#8208;PDI, and 3D&#8208;PDI are designed, to produce heavier n&#8208;type perovskites. The PDI&#8208;based molecules with Selenium atoms have a strong electron&#8208;donating ability, effectively enlarging the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting within the perovskites. Besides, the PDI molecules can coat the surface of the perovskite crystal to form the lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states and improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency, as well as the stabilities of perovskites and related devices. With the addition of the 2D&#8208;PDI, the small&#8208;area solar cells achieved a PCE of 26.06% (25.44% certified) with a high VOC of 1.18&#160;V and a remarkable fill factor of 87.23%. Furthermore, the rigid and flexible perovskite solar modules yielded high PCEs of 21.48% and 20.71%, respectively. This dimensional regulation strategy provides useful guidance for effective n&#8208;type doping and high&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells.

Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Holography
In article number 2415142, Xiaocong Yuan, Puxiang Lai, Qinghua Song, and co&#8208;workers present a multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. It not only substantially enhances the selectivity of input light, exhibiting intriguing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing channels of the output optical field, holding great potential for advanced light manipulation.

Mechanical Metamaterial
In article number 2410865, Fei Pan, Yuli Chen, and co&#8208;workers propose an automatically on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial. Driven by the pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relations, the metamaterial can automatically tune its building blocks' states using built&#8208;in actuators to match different target stress&#8208;strain curves in real time. This offers a new solution for the physical properties reprogramming of artificial systems.

Pixel Circuit Integrated MicroLED
In article number 2416015, Kyungwook Hwang, Hojin Lee, Geonwook Yoo, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate advanced technology that will transform the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro&#8208;LED (PIMLED) not only incorporates an active&#8208;pixel circuit but is also compatible with the intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer technology, ensuring no angular misalignment. The results bring forward scalable, transparent, and form&#8208;factor free active&#8208;matrix micro&#8208;LED display.

Sapphire Machining Integrated with Superconducting Qubits
In article number 2411780, Connor D. Shelly and co&#8208;workers from OQC and the University of Southampton present the integration of machining of sapphire substrates with superconducting qubits and quantum processors. It is shown that this sapphire machining process is compatible with the production of high&#8208;coherence qubits whilst maintaining tight Josephson junction parameter spread. This work provides a route to further scaling of quantum processors on sapphire.

However, there is currently still a large gap between lab research and large&#8208;scale production. In this review, the main effects of high temperature on the dielectric properties are analyzed and core modification strategies are summarized. The scientific and technological reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application are also discussed. Further, several processes for large&#8208;scale film preparation and typical device structure design are reviewed. The current research and product launches pertaining of high&#8208;temperature film capacitors are also summarized. Conclusive insights and future perspectives are delineated to offer strategic direction for the ongoing and prospective innovation in polymer dielectric materials.

The primary focus of this review is on flame&#8208;retardant materials, including polymers, biomaterials, liquid polymers, aerogels, and carbon&#8208;based materials. The fundamental properties of these materials for TENG applications are elucidated. The characteristics of each material type are described, along with their potential to boost the safety and performance of TENGs. The importance of flame retardancy in advancing TENG technology can be projected from its usage in wearable electronics, self&#8208;powered sensors, and smart textiles. Current challenges such as material compatibility, fabrication complexity, and environmental concerns are addressed, along with proposed strategies for overcoming them. This review underscores the significance of flame&#8208;retardant materials in strengthening the functionality and safety of TENG devices, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various industries. &#160;

It then delves into the mechanisms behind crystal nucleation and growth, explaining how these processes impact perovskite quality and performance. Additionally, it discusses common strategies to improve crystallization quality, including additive engineering, solvent engineering, evaporation control, and post&#8208;treatment techniques. Lastly, the review offers potential recommendations to further enhance perovskite crystallization, encouraging ongoing innovation to overcome current challenges and drive the advancement of p&#8208;MPSCs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) offer significant advantages for industrialization due to their simple fabrication process, low cost, and scalability. Recently, the certified power conversion efficiency of p&#8208;MPSCs has exceeded 22%, drawing considerable attention from the community. However, the key challenge in improving device performance is achieving uniform and high&#8208;quality perovskite crystallization within the mesoporous structure. This review highlights recent advancements in perovskite crystallization for p&#8208;MPSCs, with an emphasis on controlling crystallization kinetics and regulating perovskite morphology within confined mesopores. It first introduces the p&#8208;MPSCs, offering a solid foundation for understanding their behavior. Additionally, the review summarizes the mechanisms of crystal nucleation and growth, explaining how these processes influence the quality and performance of perovskites. Furthermore, commonly applied strategies for enhancing crystallization quality, such as additive engineering, solvent engineering, evaporation controlling, and post&#8208;treatment techniques, are also explored. Finally, the review proposes several potential suggestions aimed at further refining perovskite crystallization, inspiring continued innovation to address current limitations and advance the development of p&#8208;MPSCs.

         <title>Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics for Wearable Near&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Sensor Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro&#8208;inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near&#8208;sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in&#8208;sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things.

         <title>Destabilization of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Characterization, Mechanisms, and Regeneration Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long&#8208;term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real&#8208;world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long&#8208;term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure&#8211;stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal Complexes in Biomedical Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes are widely used in biomedical research due to their excellent properties. To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal&#8208;based drugs. This review first explores the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

         <title>Advances in Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts via Direct Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Radical Coupling Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen&#8208;releasing nano&#8208;platform for co&#8208;delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co&#8208;delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX&#8208;mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co&#8208;delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen&#8208;releasing platform possessed adaptive drug&#8208;loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

         <title>Microenvironment Mechanical Torque from ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) Micromotors Inhibiting Tumor Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self&#8208;assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton&#8208;scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down&#8208;regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano&#8208;adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force&#8208;associated non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy.

&lt;p&gt;ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles self-assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self-assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton-scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down-regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano-adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force-associated non-invasive tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;demand Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterial Driven by Structure Performance Relations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly and on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial with an embedded digital interface to its structure&#8208;performance relationships is proposed. For a given stress&#8211;strain curve, the optimal state can first be calculated based on pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relationships. Subsequently, the state of the metamaterial can be changed using integrated soft actuators, enabling accurate and fast performance reprogramming.








Abstract
The physical reprogrammability of metamaterials provides unprecedented opportunities for tailoring changeable mechanical behaviors. It is envisioned that metamaterials can actively, precisely, and rapidly reprogram their performances through digital interfaces toward varying demands. However, on&#8208;demand reprogramming by integration of physical and digital merits still remains less explored. Here, a real&#8208;time reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial is reported that is guided by its own structure&#8208;performance relations. The metamaterial consists of periodically tessellated bistable building blocks with built&#8208;in soft actuators for state switching, exhibiting rich spatial heterogeneity. Guided by the pre&#8208;established relations between state sequences and stress&#8211;strain curves, the metamaterial can accurately match a target curve by digitally tuning its state within 4 s. The metamaterial can be elastically tensioned and compressed under a strain of 4%, and its modulus tuning ratio reaches &gt;30. Moreover, it also shows highly tunable shearing and bending performances. This work provides a new thought for the physical performance reprogrammability of artificial intelligent systems.

         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Sapphire Substrate Machining with Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;sapphire machining is integrated with superconducting quantum processors (QPUs) and qubits. High coherence of the qubits is demonstrated as well as low parameter spread. This machining integration provides a route to further scaling of QPUs on new materials such as tantalum that are typically deposited on sapphire substrates. In addition, the machining provides a route to through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias in superconducting circuits.








Abstract
A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate&#8208;scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through&#8208;substrate electrical connections, necessary for low&#8208;frequency mode&#8208;mitigation, as well as signal&#8208;routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High&#8208;coherence qubits are required to build fault&#8208;tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low&#8208;loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high&#8208;coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium&#8208;nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep&#8208;silicon etching to create through&#8208;substrate&#8208;vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small&#8208;scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high&#8208;coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode&#8208;mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire&#8208;compatible materials for large&#8208;scale&#160;QPUs.

         <title>Quantum Dot Luminescence Microspheres Enable Ultra&#8208;Efficient and Bright Micro&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro&#8208;LEDs, which exhibit world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;converted micrometer&#8208;scale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED displays because of their narrow&#8208;band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro&#8208;LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450&#160;nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water&#8208;oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere&#8208;based green and red micro&#8208;LEDs achieve world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively. Finally, 0.6&#160;inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro&#8208;LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere&#8208;converted micro&#8208;LED arrays with thin&#8208;film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Stress Relaxation for Lead Iodide Nucleation in Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential&#8208;deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior&#8208;quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 white light illumination at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior-quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; white light illumination at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C temperature, in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere) after 600 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre&#8208;Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD&#8208;L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity with adjuvant&#8208;supported secretion of RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re&#8208;encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV)&#8208;based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity and heightened antibody&#8208;mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre&#8208;existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids in a Core&#8211;Shell Coordination Structure for Practical Long&#8208;Term Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a unique metal&#8208;organic core&#8211;shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long&#8208;term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase&#8208;change materials for the practical long&#8208;term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core&#8211;shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn&#8208;methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa&#183;s determines its thermal phase&#8208;stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand&#8208;exchange between erythritol and Cl&#8722; ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase&#8208;transition. This can be triggered by a small shear&#8208;stress of 10&#160;Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase&#8208;transition are explored.

         <title>Buffer&#8208;Less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer&#8208;less platform demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III&#8208;nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III&#8208;V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal&#8208;expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III&#8208;nitride buffers in conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal&#8208;organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth&#8208;stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer&#8208;less design yields a GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance of (11 &#177; 4) m2&#160;K&#160;GW&#8722;1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si and one of the lowest on any non&#8208;native substrate. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high&#8208;quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room&#8208;temperature Hall&#8208;effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, rivaling the best&#8208;reported values. As further validation, the low&#8208;temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov&#8208;de&#8208;Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell&#8208;tale signatures of spin&#8208;splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III&#8208;nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi&#8208;2D wide&#8208;bandgap systems.

         <title>In Situ, Treatment with Guanidinium Chloride Ligand Enables Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 23.5% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full&#8208;color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand&#8211;guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl&#8208;treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C&#8211;V and J&#8211;V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3&#160;V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3&#160;V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue&#8208;QLEDs.

This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue-QLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabricating Lattice&#8208;Confined Pt Single Atoms With High Electron&#8208;Deficient State for Alkali Hydrogen Evolution Under Industrial&#8208;Current Density</title>

Lattice&#8208;confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co&#8208;reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice&#8208;confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co&#8208;reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron&#8208;deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15&#160;mV to get 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030&#160;h durability under the industrial current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt&#9472;H and &#8220;free&#8221; OH radical can be directly observed for Pt1/Ni(OH)2, confirming the lattice&#8208;confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to 0.16&#160;eV for HER. Finally, this synthesis method is extended to construct other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.

         <title>Crystallographic Spin Torque Conductivity Tensor of Epitaxial IrO2 Thin Films for Oxide Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti&#8208;damping torques in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower&#8208;symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high&#8208;density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in&#8208;plane) anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower&#8208;symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin&#8208;orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high&#8208;symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower&#8208;symmetry orientations.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Surface for Radiative Cooling Enhanced Power&#8208;Free Moisture Harvesting in Unsaturated Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power&#8208;Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self&#8208;Developed &#956;&#8208;ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub&#8208;Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg per year of water and Save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero&#8208;power moisture&#8208;harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's&#160;(Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power&#8208;free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro&#8208;extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of &#8776;92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5&#160;&#181;m waveband and emissivity of &#8776;98.1% in 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m waveband, which are &#8776;19.2% and &#8776;15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of &#8776;6.9 &#176;C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of &#8776;153&#176; and a rolling angle of &#8776;42&#176;, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub&#8208;dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg year&#8722;1 of water and save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh year&#8722;1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power&#8208;free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

         <title>Directional Freeze&#8208;Casting Cryogel Loaded with Quaternized Chitosan Modified Gallium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Capture and Eradicate the Resistant Bacteria for Guided Regeneration in Infected Bone Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221; and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long&#8208;term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria (Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221;, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze&#8208;casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells.

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221; and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa-MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long-term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium-based metal&#8211;organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221;, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze-casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as-prepared Me/QCSGa-MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The First Molecular Ferroelectric Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal&#8211;insulator transition&#8208;like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high&#8208;temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

         <title>Synergistic Adhesion and Shape Deformation in Nanowire&#8208;Structured Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape&#8208;changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire&#8208;induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire&#8208;induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire&#8208;augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

         <title>Creating Single Atomic Coordination for Hypoxia&#8208;Resistant Pyroptosis Nano&#8208;Inducer to Boost Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia&#8208;resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non&#8208;photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#160;to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano&#8208;inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe&#8211;N4 centers to develop hypoxia&#8208;resistant type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal&#8208;Odd Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnet Co&#8322;SiO&#8324; possessing a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E&#8208;induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field&#8208;induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time&#8208;reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet&#8208;like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet&#8208;like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E&#8208;induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnet, Co&#8322;SiO&#8324;, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E&#8208;induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E&#8208;induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.

To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-induced NDD), is employed. Signals of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$-odd antiferromagnet, Co&#8322;SiO&#8324;, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$-odd antiferromagnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Modulus Homochiral Torsional Oxide Ceramic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J&#160;g&#8722;1, and a high output power of 10.3 W&#160;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of &#8776;180&#160;GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5&#160;MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large&#8208;scale manufacturing of high&#8208;modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Biophotocatalytic Nano&#8208;Organelle Reactors with Programmable DNA Switches for Combating Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self&#8208;contained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell&#8208;inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self&#8208;sustained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio&#8208;chem&#8208;photocatalytic cascade&#8208;driven starvation&#8208;photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano&#8208;organelle reactor allows quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space&#8208;confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol&#8208;based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase&#8208;like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on&#8208;demand activation in tumors through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self&#8208;sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors. Strong built&#8208;in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric&#8208;like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus&#8208;material&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face&#8208;dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric&#8208;like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built&#8208;in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally&#8208;grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based&#160;applications.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Surface Ligands Enables Versatile Optical Patterning and Form Factor Flexibility in Quantum Dot Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially ligand&#8208;exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure&#8208;color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i&#8208;line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full&#8208;color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3&#160;&#181;m and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA&#8208;derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self&#8208;healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra&#8208;fine patterning and on&#8208;silicon displays.

         <title>Mesoporous Boron&#8208;Doped Carbon with Curved B4C Active Sites for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media and Air&#8208;Supplied Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbon (meso&#8208;BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction&#160;catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory&#160;calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air&#8208;supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

         <title>1.6&#8208;Inch Transparent Micro&#8208;Display with Pixel Circuit Integrated microLED Chip Array by Misalignment&#8208;Free Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro&#8208;LED (PIMLED) does not need an active&#8208;matrix backplane but has an active&#8208;pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next&#8208;generation micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active&#8208;matrix backplane with the transferred &#181;LEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the &#181;LED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit&#8208;integrated micro&#8208;LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low&#8208;temperature poly&#8208;silicon transistors and GaN &#181;LED. The square&#8208;shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four&#8208;fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 &#215; 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form&#8208;factor free and transparent &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Minute&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Switching and Long Cycle Stability of Thermochromic Inorganic Perovskite Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2&#160;&#176;C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy&#8208;saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4&#8211;34.3&#160;&#176;C within 1.9&#8211;5.1&#160;min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention &#8805;97.4%) and transition time (retention &#8805;97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three&#8208;dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero&#8208;dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature&#160;=&#160;21.6&#8211;26.5&#160;&#176;C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9&#160;&#176;C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house&#160;=&#160;60&#160;&#176;C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

         <title>Distinct Transmission of Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Handed Magnon Modes in Compensated Ferrimagnet/Antiferromagnet Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin&#8208;flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality&#8208;based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin&#8208;flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality&#8208;based magnonics.

         <title>Bifunctional Group Modulation Strategy Enables MR&#8208;TADF Electroluminescence Toward BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non&#8208;sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract
Herein, a parallel &#8220;bifunctional group&#8221; modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[b,d]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group 1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8243;&#8208;triphenyl, and electron acceptors 1,3&#8208;difluorobenzene and benzonitrile, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIEy value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non&#8208;sensitized pure&#8208;green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh and DBNDS&#8208;DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIEy value reaching 0.76 in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure as reported in the literature.

The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet in solvents. The adoption of the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro&#8208;crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein&#8208;assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core&#8208;shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein&#8208;containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification&#8208;assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

         <title>Sargassum Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Fully Ingestible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using food&#8208;safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food&#8208;grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high&#8208;performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm&#8722;2 and a high energy density of 307 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self&#8208;discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

         <title>Efficient and Scalable Direct Regeneration of Spent Layered Cathode Materials via Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1&#160;Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.

Additionally, a techno-economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Control of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in Molecular Ferroelectric for Multiplexing Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM&#8208;MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM&#8208;MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading (EWOR) and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Scattering Perovskite Scintillator Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution Computed Tomography Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial&#8208;resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X&#8208;ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high&#8208;resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti&#8208;scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost&#8208;effective solution&#8208;processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low&#8208;dosage and high&#8208;resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm&#8722;1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

         <title>2D Nanochannel Interlayer Realizing High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively&#8208;stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi&#8208;conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li&#8211;S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) yield a capacity of 2&#8208;Ah at 100&#160;mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Piezoelectric Vitamin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assemblies for Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule&#8208;based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self&#8208;assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self&#8208;assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC&#160;N&#8722;1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D&#8208;BIO assemblies&#8208;based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of &#8776;0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing&#8208;releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG&#8208;based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG&#8208;based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high&#8208;performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin&#8208;spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin&#8208;induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type&#8208;II multiferroicity from non&#8208;collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto&#8208;structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering (RXS) and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non&#8208;polar phase (60 K&#160;&lt;&#160;T&#160;&lt;&#160;75 K), a distinct q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first&#8208;order CI&#8208;helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean&#8208;field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto&#8208;structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

         <title>Fluorine Doping&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction of Isolated Cu Sites for CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F&#8208;doped Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single&#8208;atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2&#8722;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of &#8722;2.01 A mgper Cu&#8722;1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mgper Cu&#8722;1at &#8776;&#8722;1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Nanozymes for Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT&#8208;imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non&#8208;quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high&#8208;throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt&#8208;treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X&#8208;ray imaging without side effects.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air&#8208;sensitive sodium&#8208;rich LTMOs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries,&#160;which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency Through Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Molecular Epitaxial Growth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks on BiVO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular&#8208;level epitaxial growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular&#8208;level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov&#8208;BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen&#8208;rich ligands of MIL&#8208;101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high&#8208;performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Si solar cell system, achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular&#8208;level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL&#8208;101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Boosting Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers by Simply Adding Nucleating Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply adding a nucleating agent N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA)&#160;to poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (PBTTT&#8208;C14) precisely tunes its crystallization and maximizes structural order. The improved molecular packing reduces disorder and elevates charge mobility. With optimized doping, this polymer achieves remarkable electrical conductivity (up to 1968&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;) and a power factor &#8776;176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, expanding possibilities for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Controlling the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is critical for optimizing thermoelectric performance, yet remains challenging, requiring complex processing techniques like alignment. In this study, a straightforward strategy is introduced to enhance the thermoelectric properties of semi&#8208;crystalline polymer films by incorporating minimal amounts of nucleating agents, a method widely used in traditional polymer industries. By blending less than 1 wt% of N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) into poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (PBTTT&#8208;C14), controlled modulation of crystallization behavior is achieved, resulting in reduced structural disorder and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Systematic investigations reveal that an optimal PDA loading of 0.9 wt% increases the crystallization degree by 45% compared to pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. Under these optimized conditions, the PDA&#8208;modified PBTTT&#8208;C14 films exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,894&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor of 176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, showing improvements of 96% and 433%, respectively, over doped pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. These gains are attributed to the synergistic effects of polymer chain extension and reduced grain boundary resistance, which collectively enhance charge transport efficiency. Additionally, ion exchange doping is found to maintain a high charge carrier concentration while preserving the crystallinity introduced by PDA, paving the way for advanced thermoelectric materials and next&#8208;generation polymer&#8208;based electronics.

         <title>A Robust, Biodegradable, and Fire&#8208;Retardant Cellulose Nanofibers&#8208;Based Structural Material Fabricated from Natural Sargassum</title>

         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire&#8208;retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. This bio&#8208;based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire&#8208;retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high&#8208;strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire&#8208;retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom&#8208;up hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (&#8776;297 MPa), thermal stability (&#8776;200&#160;&#176;C), low thermal expansion coefficient (&#8776;7.17 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1), and fire&#8208;retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber&#8208;based high&#8208;performance structural materials in the future.

A unique Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single&#8208;atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy. This Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192&#160;mV and superb stability over 650&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59&#160;V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate&#8208;evolving mechanism on Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic&#8208;level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high-performance electrocatalysts at atomic-level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Wenzel Interfaces Design for Homogeneous Solute Distribution Obtains Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super&#8208;hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee&#8208;ring effect during the large&#8208;area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee&#8208;ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large&#8208;area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super&#8208;hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro&#8208;spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super&#8208;hydrophilicity and micro&#8208;rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus&#8208;coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high&#8208;performance and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Microglial&#8208;Biomimetic Memantine&#8208;Loaded Polydopamine Nanomedicines for Alleviating Depression</title>

         <dc:description>
A microglial&#8208;biomimetic memantine&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, that achieves blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate depression&#8208;like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine&#8208;based antidepressants as first&#8208;line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation&#8208;targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical&#8208;scavenging capacity, PDA&#8208;Mem@M attenuate&#160;the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on&#8208;demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases&#160;the expression of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factors and reverses&#160;the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate&#160;depression&#8208;like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

         <title>Phytic Acid&#8208;Induced Gradient Hydrogels for Highly Sensitive and Broad Range Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low&#8208;pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA&#8208;polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel&#8208;based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00&#160;kPa&#8722;1, &lt;15&#160;kPa) and a broad sensing range (from &#8776;3.7&#160;Pa to 1.2&#160;MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

         <title>All Light Controlled Five State Logic Gates on a Ferroelectric Ceramic Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel planar three&#8208;electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT&#8208;BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region&#8208;dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all&#8208;in&#8208;one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;xT) through co&#8208;firing metallic Ti powders and BZT&#8208;BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three&#8208;electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region&#8208;dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as&#8208;fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light&#8208;controlled methods, including &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221; and &#8220;NOR&#8221;. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405&#160;nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross&#8208;linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate&#8208;terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal&#8208;protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.

Based on two kinds of biomolecule&#8208;MOFs, we construct a self&#8208;powered multi&#8208;functional wearable device by combining Zn&#8208;Car_MOF and patterned PDMS to achieve various environmental energy collection (water droplets, ocean energy, and e&#8208;bike driving) and human gait detection, when Thy loaded Cu&#8208;HHTP_MOF combined with wearable fibers are cooperated with Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG, achieving electrocatalytic ROS generation and drug releasing synergistic sterilization.








Abstract
New types of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule&#8208;MOFs (Bio&#8208;MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation&#8208;reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self&#8208;powered muti&#8208;functional device to achieve an efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine&#8208;based Zn&#8208;Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V&#8722;1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo&#8208;piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131&#160;V at 100&#160;kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1&#160;Pa&#8211;100&#160;kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu&#8208;HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu&#8208;HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self&#8208;powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad&#8208;spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency &#8805; 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti&#8208;functional Bio&#8208;MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self&#8208;powered antibacterial.

The high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide&#8208;temperature range operation from &#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long&#8208;lifespan and all&#8208;climate sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high&#8208;performance NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e&#8722; at voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.45/1.5&#8211;4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g&#8722;1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of &#8722;50&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The assembled hard carbon//HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP full&#8208;cell offers an energy density of &#8776;301 Wh kg&#8722;1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high&#8208;performance cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Maximizing Output Energy via Suppressing Charge Loss and Increasing Load Voltage in Charge Extraction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo&#8208;charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo&#8208;charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo&#8208;charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi&#8208;dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo&#8208;charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15&#8208;fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo&#8208;interface.&#160;A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

     alt="Maximizing Output Energy via Suppressing Charge Loss and Increasing Load Voltage in Charge Extraction Process"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo-charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective collection of interfacial tribo-charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo-charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi-dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo-charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15-fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo-interface.&#160;A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An efficiently reactant&#8208;enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high&#8208;curvature Pt can greatly promote the H3O+ supply rate during HER, resulting in &#8764;1.6 times higher H3O+ concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X&#8208;ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H3O+ in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm&#8722;2Pt at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with a cell voltage of 1.88 V at 60 &#176;C and can operate stably for at least 800 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 137 &#181;V h&#8722;1.

         <title>Local Polarization Piezoelectric Electric Field Promoted Water Dissociation for Hydroxyl Radical Generation under Ambient Humidity Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H&#8211;O&#8211;H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in&#8208;depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the &#183;OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23&#160;eV) endows &#183;OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water&#8208;oversaturated condition (0.66&#160;eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of &#183;OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field&#8208;initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Single&#8208;Molecule Affinity Detection at 10&#8722;20 Molar</title>

Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH&#8208;conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA&#8208;strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH&#8208;conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity&#8208;biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self&#8208;propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single&#8208;target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10&#8315;&#8313; molar. In this study, plasmonic single&#8208;molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits&#8208;of&#8208;detections (LODs) as low as 10&#8315;2&#8304; molar (1&#160;&#177;&#160;1 molecule in 0.1&#160;mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude. The single&#8208;molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter&#8208;wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition&#8208;elements (antibodies or protein&#8211;probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH&#8208;conditioning. Potentiometric and surface&#8208;probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH&#8208;conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self&#8208;propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single&#8208;affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR&#8208;based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care plasmonic systems.

         <title>Spin State Modulation with Oxygen Vacancy Orientates C/N Intermediates for Urea Electrosynthesis of Ultrahigh Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored transformation of high&#8208;spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low&#8208;spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3&#8210;&#8594;*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2&#8594;*COOH on adjacent Ce3+&#8211;O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced C&#8208;/N&#8208;intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch&#8208;Meiser process, while the complexity of C&#8208;/N&#8208;containing intermediates for C&#8722;N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C&#8722;N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47&#160;&#181;g mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high&#8208;spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2&#8722;x to the low&#8208;spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+&#8722;O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C&#8722;N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea.

In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO for C&#8722;N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47&#160;&#181;g mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%.

         <title>Engineering EVs&#8208;Mediated mRNA Delivery Regulates Microglia Function and Alleviates Depressive&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co&#8208;delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non&#8208;neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles&#8208;based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual&#8208;pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Biomass Oxidation via Acid&#8208;Induced In Situ Surface Reconstruction of Multivalent State Coexistence in Metal Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction&#8208;synthesis&#8208;validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid&#8208;induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species&#160;on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH&#8208;mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5&#8208;HMF as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Triboelectric Soft Pneumatic Actuator&#8208;Enabled Hand Rehabilitation Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, lobster tail&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG&#8208;SPA) is introduced, featuring self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method&#8212;which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience&#8208;based scoring&#8212;thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post&#8208;stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high&#8208;force&#8208;output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator&#160;(TENG&#8208;SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG&#8208;SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1&#160;MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti&#8208;interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG&#8208;SPA under varying conditions&#8212;such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching&#8212;are explored, demonstrating TENG&#8208;SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p &lt;&#160;0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human&#8211;machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

         <title>Engineering Highly Aligned and Densely Populated Cardiac Muscle Bundles via Fibrin Remodeling in 3D&#8208;Printed Anisotropic Microfibrous Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of 3D&#8208;printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell&#8208;mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high&#8208;density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high&#8208;density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high&#8208;density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell&#8208;mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 &#215; 107 cells&#160;mL&#8722;1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the development of 3D-printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell-mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high-density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high-density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high-density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell-mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells&#160;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Fluid Interface Manipulated by Fluid Balancing Agent for Scalable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>

Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small&#8208;size, high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large&#8208;area, high&#8208;uniformity perovskite films and thus high&#8208;efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large&#8208;area fabrication processes. In this work, a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free, large&#8208;area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade&#8208;coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800&#160;h under ambient conditions (35&#160;&#177;&#160;5% relative humidity, 30&#160;&#176;C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494&#160;nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution&#8208;processed, industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.

         <title>Sole&#8208;Solvent High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Practical Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah&#8208;level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg&#8722;1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high&#8208;density energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized for the first time via a sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with unique solvent&#8208;ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high&#8208;concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;level anode&#8208;free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell&#8208;level energy density of 209&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

         <title>Army Ant Nest Inspired Adaptive Textile for Smart Thermal Regulation and Healthcare Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life&#8208;threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the &#8220;site migration&#8221; behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health&#8208;related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next&#8208;generation smart e&#8208;textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

         <title>U&#8208;Shaped Dimeric Acceptors for Balancing Efficiency and Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors, 5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6&#8208;IDT&#8211; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT can well stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.








Abstract
Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors (5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors&#8208;based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000&#160;h of thermal stress. This is mainly attributed to the ability of the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT to stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the polymeric donor and small molecular acceptor, rather than the high glass transition temperature and low diffusion coefficient.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-shaped dimeric acceptors, 5-IDT and 6-IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6-IDT&#8211; and 5-IDT-treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5-IDT can well stabilize the phase-separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-shaped dimeric acceptors (5-IDT and 6-IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non-radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6-IDT- and 5-IDT-treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors-based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6-IDT- and 5-IDT-treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000&#160;h of thermal stress.

         <title>The Photoinduced Response of Antimony from Femtoseconds to Minutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump&#8208;probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi&#8208;step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic&#160;applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a general multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi&#8208;channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg&#8208;Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry&#8208;phase metasurface with a non&#8208;interleaved approach can be used to support such multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high&#8208;density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

         <title>Supramolecular Scale Hydrophilicity Regulation Enabling Efficient Dewatering and Assembly of Nanocellulose into Dense and Strong Bulk Materials as Sustainable Plastic Substitutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire&#8208;retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot&#8208;press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426&#160;g cm&#8722;3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strength (75.5 &#177; 4.5&#160;MPa), flexural strength (198 &#177; 20&#160;MPa), and hardness (&#8776;300&#160;MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom&#8208;up assembly of CNFs into high&#8208;performance multifunctional eco&#8208;friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

         <title>Overcoming Energy&#8208;Scaling Barriers: Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy for regulating the local electronic structure is applied to create a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi&#8208;step NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight&#8208;electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three&#8208;chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi&#8208;functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi&#8208;step reactions by circumventing adsorption&#8208;energy scaling limitations.

         <title>Multiple Electron Transfers Enable High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Through Stable Anionic Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si&#9472;O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large&#8208;molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost&#8208;effective and light&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O&#8210;O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with an energy density of 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high&#8208;current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Development of Marine&#8208;Degradable Poly(Ester Amide)s with Strong, Up&#8208;Scalable, and Up&#8208;Cyclable Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for fabricating poly(ester amide)s combines the benefits of biodegradable polyesters and strong polyamides. These materials, made from upcycled monomers, form films, and yarns with a tensile strength of 109 MPa, tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, and withstand ironing temperatures. They achieve 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months and have a low environmental impact.








Abstract
Biodegradable polyesters provide an attractive alternative to non&#8208;degradable plastics but often encounter a tradeoff between biodegradability and mechanical properties because esters are rotational and lack hydrogen bonds. Conversely, natural polyamides, i.e., silk exhibit excellent mechanical strength because amides are non&#8208;rotational and form hydrogen bonds. Unlike esters, the nitrogen in amides can enhance microbial biodegradation. However, protein engineering exhibits limited productivity, and artificial polyamides, i.e., nylon remain non&#8208;degradable due to their hydrophobic nature. Herein, a method is proposed for developing poly(ester amide)s (PEA)s, a polyester and polyamide hybrid, to address prevailing production challenges. These materials are synthesized from upcycled monomers in a 10 L reactor and converted into films and yarns. They achieve a tensile strength of 109 MPa and tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, while withstanding ironing temperatures. They achieve a remarkable 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months, which is rarely attained by current bioplastics, and exhibit low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. While biodegradable polyesters have remained within the performance range of commodity plastics, PEAs fall into the high&#8208;performance category, potentially reaching markets that existing biodegradable plastics have not, such as fishing lines and clothing.

         <title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet&#8208;textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of &#8776;20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

         <title>Boosting Amino Acid Synthesis with WOx Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub&#8208;nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high&#8208;value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater and biomass&#8208;derived blocks into high&#8208;value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3&#8208;NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing &#945;&#8208;keto acids, the WOx/D&#8208;CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2&#8208;C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a &#8220;clean&#8221; carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)&#8208;F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross&#8208;sectional TEM, HAADF&#8208;STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF&#8208;8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA&#8208;F127/ZIF&#8208;8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon&#8208;isolated ZIF&#8208;8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

         <title>Bioinspired Electrostatic Capture&#8208;and&#8208;Release System for Precise Microdroplet Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative electrostatic capture&#8208;and&#8208;release manipulator enabling precise microdroplet emission and transportation. Utilizing electrostatic forces and dielectric pinning, it achieves controlled, contamination&#8208;free manipulation of nanoscale droplets. The study explores its application in diverse fields, including microfluidics, chemical reactions, and material fabrication, offering a sustainable and highly accurate platform for droplet&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field&#8208;driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination&#8208;free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force&#8208;driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic&#8208;based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

         <title>Tailored Colloidal Shapes in Precursor Solutions for Efficient Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94&#160;cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade&#8208;coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600&#160;h continuous operation.
