         <title>Enabling Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells via Sustainable Operando Defect&#8208;Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic spiro&#8208;oxazine enables sustainable operando passivation via dual&#8208;mode isomerization, achieving 24.72% efficiency in small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 19.07% in 61.6&#160;cm2 modules with exceptional light/UV stability.








Abstract
The amount of passivator is usually optimized for freshly prepared devices, which is static and short&#8208;term. However, photoinduced defects and the movement of halogen ions are dynamically generated in real time. Long&#8208;term operational passivation, designed to address the dynamic characteristics of defect generation, is largely overlooked but is critically important. In this work, a classical photochromic compound, Spiro&#8208;oxazine (SO), is introduced to develop a sustainable operando passivation strategy. The two configurations of this isomer fulfill different requirements: the normal form addresses the needs of freshly prepared devices with fewer defect passivation requirements, while the post&#8208;isomeric form in situ operando captures light&#8208;induced defects during operation, enabling sustainable passivation. As a result, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) fabricated using this operando strategy achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.72%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.215&#160;V, and demonstrated remarkable stability, retaining 82% of its initial PCE after 1580 h under simulated sunlight and 80% after 144 h under UV light. Large&#8208;area PSC modules fabricated using the proposed strategy achieved a PCE of 19.07% over an active area of 61.6 cm2. This work provides valuable guidance for designing self&#8208;healing perovskite films and highlights the urgent need for improved passivation durability.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

         <title>Revealing the Catalysis Modes for Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Molten Salt Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) loaded with various metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is constructed as a sulfur host for molten salt Al&#8208;S batteries, and the effects of different SACs on the reaction kinetics of the sulfur positive electrodes are examined. Based on strong anchoring of polysulfides and regulation of the conversion rate kinetics at different stages, the CoNC@S positive electrode achieves stable cycling up to 6000 cycles.








Abstract
Molten salt aluminum&#8208;sulfur (MSAS) batteries operated at a sub&#8208;water&#8208;boiling temperature are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of the low costs along with moderate energy density. However, the sulfur positive electrode is plagued by the sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides, which hampers the rate and cycling performance. Herein, carbon materials integrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are utilized as the model sulfur hosts for MSAS batteries and comprehensively investigate the active modes of these SACs on cell performance. Results show that the cell utilizing cobalt&#8208;SACs shows an initial specific capacity of 1064&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, retaining 88.5% capacity after 100 cycles. Even at 3C, the cell achieves a specific capacity of 533&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and demonstrates record&#8208;long cycle performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of only 0.0014% per cycle over 6000 cycles. By combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, a new mechanism is undercovered wherein &#8211; owed to differentiated binding toward varied Al&#8208;polysulfides &#8211; the cobalt&#8208;SAC tunes down the conversion of long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides while accelerating that from short&#8208;chain polysulfides to solid Al2S3. This mechanism alleviates polysulfide accumulation in the molten salt electrolyte, mitigates the shuttle effect, and enhances the overall sulfur reaction kinetics.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Ion Intercalation in Graphene via Thermal and Electrostatic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Europium ions reversibly intercalate into the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene when heat and electrostatic gate act together, switching the stacking order and electronic response on demand. Real&#8208;time transport, simulations, and device tests expose a hidden 2D Eu sheet and its temperature&#8208;tuned diffusion, showing a versatile electrochemical route toward reconfigurable 2D heterostructures with rare&#8208;earth functionality.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale control and understanding the controlling strategy of ion intercalation are pivotal for advancing energy storage, quantum technologies, and adaptive electronics. While intercalation &#8211; the insertion of ions into layered materials &#8211; has transformative potential, the mechanisms driving it, particularly for rare&#8208;earth ions, remain poorly understood. Here, a thermal&#8208;electrostatic strategy is developed to achieve reversible and tunable europium ion intercalation that enables precise control over intercalation dynamics. This study investigates how temperature and voltage influence the intercalation of europium ions into bilayer graphene. Our results reveal the formation of a 2D europium layer and ionic state of intercalation europium within the graphene structure, providing fundamental insights into intercalation energetics. This work establishes a versatile platform for designing adaptive 2D heterostructure, engineering advanced materials and devices with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Breaking the Selectivity Barrier of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Through Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Ligand Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, Ru SAzyme with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chlorine ligands is reported as a monofunctional, high&#8208;performance peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme. Incorporating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ligand coordination emulates enzyme selectivity and regulates reaction pathways for an identical substrate.

Peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe&#8211;N4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru&#8208;centered SAzymes coordinated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD&#8208;like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD&#8208;like activity, which is 38&#8208;fold greater than its catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT&#8208;like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H2O2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT&#8208;like reaction. This selective POD&#8208;like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction under near&#8208;neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

&lt;p&gt;Here, Ru SAzyme with out-of-plane chlorine ligands is reported as a monofunctional, high-performance peroxidase-like nanozyme. Incorporating out-of-plane ligand coordination emulates enzyme selectivity and regulates reaction pathways for an identical substrate. The optimized Ru SAzyme exhibits exceptional peroxidase-selective activity (38-fold higher than its catalase-like activity) and demonstrates practical applicability for simultaneous biomarker quantification under near-neutral conditions.

         <title>Multifunctional Hollow Carbon Microspheres Enable Superior Electromagnetic Wave Response and Corrosion Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon microspheres with superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced. As results, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;57.5 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 5.67 GHz are achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that dual passivation effects provide a barrier to hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with corrosion barrier exhibit immense potential in meeting the requirements of electronic defense technology in the complex marine environments, but still confront conflicts in disentangling the trade&#8208;off of multifunctional applications. Herein, hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) that simultaneously possess superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced with the aid of self&#8208;sacrificing templates. During the pyrolysis, the reductive characteristic of Zn microspheres and thermal driving force promote magnetic domain evolution, which enables optimized hetero&#8208;interface resonance and strong magnetic interactions, facilitating a minimum reflection loss lower than &#8722;40 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth greater than 5 GHz. Furthermore, HCMs&#8208;900 with both anion&#8208;repulsion characteristics and better resistance can partially reduce the adsorption/accumulation of corrosive species and decrease the charge&#8208;carrying ability, and the inevitably generated by&#8208;products of layered double hydroxides with strong anion&#8208;capture ability can hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface, resulting in superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability. This innovative strategy inspires us with a motivated pathway for the rational design of advanced multifunctional anti&#8208;corrosive EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Van Der Waals Integration of 4&#8208;Inch Single&#8208;Crystalline III&#8208;Nitride Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;engineered van der Waals (vdW) integration facilitates the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN, revealing polarization&#8208;regulated vdW gaps and substantially reduced dislocation densities. This method achieves an exceptionally low dislocation density, thereby enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;performance HEMTs with enhanced saturation current density and effectively mitigating off&#8208;state leakage current.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy III&#8208;nitride semiconductors on 2D materials, characterized by a van der Waals (vdW) interface, enables strain relaxation, reduction in dislocation density, and facile release from substrate. However, the limited wettability of 2D materials and weak interfacial interactions pose significant challenges in achieving ordered crystallographic orientation of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors at the wafer scale. Here, this study has been successfully developed a polarization&#8208;engineered vdW integration strategy (PEVIS) for the growth of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. By engineering robust electronic polarization in epitaxial substrates, the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN layers is successfully achieved on wafers coated with 2D materials using PEVIS. Additionally, this approach exhibits a remarkably low threading dislocations density of 3.49&#160;&#215;&#160;108 cm&#8722;2 on the vdW surface, even when the GaN epitaxial layer thickness is reduced to 400&#160;nm. Furthermore, the fabricated GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) achieve an average high mobility of 2080.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, a high saturation current density of 790&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, and effectively mitigates the off&#8208;state leakage current to 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;6&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work signifies a significant advancement in the theoretical comprehension of heteroepitaxy on 2D materials and introduces a novel methodology for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline high&#8208;quality III&#8208;nitride semiconductors.

Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual&#8208;channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and suppressed charge recombination. The optimal device achieves a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, ranking among the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for commercialization owing to their well&#8208;defined molecular structures and minimal batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations. Nevertheless, the inherent challenges in precise control of blend morphology of the active layer restrict exciton utilization efficiency, resulting in the restricted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in ASM&#8208;OSC compared with polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Herein, small molecule donor Por&#8208;BR is incorporated into the acceptor layer of the DAPor&#8208;DPP/6TIC system utilizing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition strategy to construct high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs. The LbL deposition strategy facilitates the formation of a more pronounced vertical phase distribution in the active layer. Besides, dual&#8208;channel FRET from Por&#8208;BR to both DAPor&#8208;DPP and 6TIC occurs in the active layer. Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual&#8208;channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and reduced charge recombination. The optimal device delivers a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, representing one of the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs. This work offers an effective strategy for device performance enhancement, which in turn facilitates the industrialization of OSCs.

         <title>Textile Encoding Inspired by Langer Lines via Elastically Graded Embroidered Tessellations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standard embroidery machine can encode skin&#8208;like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet&#8208;conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.








Abstract
Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures. Tissues, such as skin, act as biological metamaterials whose internal structures, such as packed collagen fibers, produce nonlinear and directional responses. Similarly, hierarchical thread packing governs the mechanical response of textiles. However, the capability of encoding textiles at the fabric level and at a sufficient resolution remains limited. Embroidering triangularly tiled zigzag patterns of inextensible thread on a stretchable fabric is demonstrated to encode distributed, directional stress&#8211;strain behavior at subcentimeter resolution, sufficient to mimic complex physiological characteristics such as Langer lines of the skin. The triangular unit cells solved the K&#246;nigsberg bridge problem of filling a plane with a continuous thread pair. The encoding maps directionality, directional contrast, and magnitude, three parameters that define unit cells' compliance, into hue&#8208;saturation&#8208;value color space for rapid qualitative design. Cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free arrays of embroidered restrictors enable scalable augmentation of textile mechanics. The transition threshold from the matrix&#8208; to fiber&#8208;defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape&#8208;morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet&#8208;conforming shoes. Industry&#8208;standard machine embroidery scales biomechanics&#8208;inspired structures for wearable and environmental robotics and promises future biohybrid&#160;technologies.

The transition threshold from the matrix- to fiber-defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape-morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet-conforming shoes. Industry-standard machine embroidery scales biomechanics-inspired structures for wearable and environmental robotics and promises future biohybrid&#160;technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Evolution in Hard Carbon Synthesis via Electrothermal Coupling Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional hard carbon synthesis suffers from structural degradation like amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse due to prolonged sintering, impairing sodium storage. Researchers report an ultrafast (30&#8208;s) electrothermal coupling strategy using joule heating for carbonization, effectively preventing this structural damage. This method preserves abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing, leading to superior sodium storage performance.








Abstract
Conventional hard carbon synthesis through prolonged sintering suffers from structural degradation, including amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse, critically impairing sodium storage performance. Here, a spatiotemporally controlled electrothermal coupling strategy is proposed that revolutionizes carbonization via in situ joule heating, achieving ultrafast synthesis (30 s) with preserved structural integrity. By precisely regulating current density distribution, this method enables defect&#8208;selective graphitization while maintaining abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing (0.39 nm). The optimized hard carbon synthesized at 1000&#160;&#176;C demonstrates exceptional sodium storage capacity (306.83 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and record&#8208;high initial Coulombic efficiency (91.99%), outperforming furnace sample by 16.7% in capacity. During the spatiotemporal evolution process, localized electric field can induce directional charge redistribution and lower C&#9472;C bond dissociation barriers, enabling rapid formation of microporous structure with enhanced Na&#8314; diffusion kinetics and stable interfacial properties. Temporal superiority of this method is evidenced by 79.45% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This work establishes a paradigm for energy&#8208;efficient carbon material synthesis via spatiotemporal electrothermal control, providing fundamental insights into field&#8208;assisted reaction kinetics for next&#8208;generation battery manufacturing.

         <title>Bioinspired Flame&#8208;Retardant and Impact&#8208;Resistant Aramid Composites via Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Self&#8208;Assembly for Firefighting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening aramid composites, featuring both rigidity and flexibility through interfacial hydrogen bonding and internal boron&#8208;oxygen bonding, are developed using a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. The strength and modulus of the composite after combustion are 4006% and 2519% higher than those of shear&#8208;stiffening&#8208;gel&#8208;based Kevlar, respectively, highlighting its mechanical&#8208;thermal coupling protection. Consequently, composite&#8208;based firefighter uniforms absorbing 190.04&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 ballistic impacts are designed.








Abstract
Frequent fire accidents pose serious threats to firefighter security, necessitating progressively stringent demands on the performance of protective materials for firefighting clothing. This work proposes an advanced nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening gel (SSG)&#8208;magnesium hydroxide (MH) coating engineered aramid Kevlar composite, which exhibits exceptional anti&#8208;impact and flame&#8208;retardant properties. The SSG&#8208;MH&#8208;Kevlar (SMK) composite is fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking method, facilitating the self&#8208;assembly of SMK into a highly oriented and long&#8208;range lamellar structure. The hydrogen bonding and dynamic boron&#8208;oxygen crosslinking further enhance the interface interaction, thereby contributing to extraordinary mechanical properties superior to many commercially available fabrics. After combustion, SMK composite maintains its outstanding thermal and mechanical properties, demonstrating a 46% reduction in thermal radiation temperature and a 4006% increase in tensile strength compared to the unmodified SSG&#8208;Kevlar (SK) fabric. Post&#8208;fire SMK composite can withstand projectile impacts, maintaining shape integrity upon the 100&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 loading, whereas both Kevlar and SK composites are penetrated. Ultimately, an SMK&#8208;integrated firefighter uniform is manufactured, providing desirable defense efficiency during continuous 1&#8208;h burning and blast impact excitations. Furthermore, SMK cloth demonstrates exceptional thermal protection and stability in accordance with the GA10&#8208;2014 standard, outperforming conventional commercial firefighting uniforms.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Thiazolothiazole for High&#8208;Performance UV&#8208;OPDs Seamlessly Integrated with CMOS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, semi&#8208;transparent UV&#8208;selective photodiodes are developed by elucidating how the backbone planarity and conjugation length of Tz molecules influence film morphology and charge transport within the device. These vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodetectors are monolithically integrated with CMOS image sensors, showcasing multifunctional imaging capabilities and advancing the commercialization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based photodetectors.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodiodes (OPDs) offer unique advantages&#8212;including narrowband selectivity and compatibility with standard fabrication processes&#8212;but achieving ultraviolet (UV) selectivity in such devices remains a key challenge. This is due to the need to reconcile two competing design requirements: 1) strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking for efficient charge transport, and 2) limited &#960;&#8208;conjugation to retain a wide bandgap suitable for UV absorption and vacuum deposition. Here, we report a molecular design strategy for UV&#8208;selective OPDs based on thiazolothiazole (Tz)&#8208;based small molecules with tailored backbone planarity and conjugation length. The resulting vacuum&#8208;deposited active layers simultaneously exhibit wide bandgaps and robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The optimized devices achieve outstanding UV selectivity (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum: 60 nm), high specific detectivity (1.06 &#215; 1012 Jones), and fast dynamic response (cutoff frequency of 50,100 Hz)&#8212;representing the highest performance for vacuum&#8208;deposited UV&#8208;OPDs reported to date. Furthermore, it is demonstrated the seamless integration of these semi&#8208;transparent OPDs with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors (CIS), underscoring their potential for multifunctional imaging applications. The findings provide key molecular insights for advancing UV&#8208;selective organic photodetectors.

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots Assisted Virus Tracking: From Skin to Brain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon quantum dots&#8208;dissolvable microneedle, CQDs&#8208;dMN system, enables painless delivery and real&#8208;time tracking of HSV&#8208;1. The HSV&#8208;1 is labeled with fluorescent CQDs and delivered to the skin dermis, minimizing damage compared to traditional methods. Real&#8208;time imaging shows that the dMN swells with interstitial fluid, releasing HSV&#8208;1, which rapidly infects peripheral nerves and spreads from the spinal cord to brain.








Abstract
Incurable infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) can cause severe encephalitis and neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. How HSV&#8208;1 reaches the brain from the initial infection site remains inconclusive. Here, an innovative approach combining carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with dissolving microneedles (dMN) for real&#8208;time tracking of HSV&#8208;1 from skin to brain is presented. Upon application, CQDs&#8208;HSV&#8208;1 is released from the dMN through the swelling of interstitial fluid (ISF) in skin and subsequently monitored by living imaging. Remarkably, it is observed that HSV&#8208;1 preferentially infects peripheral skin nerves, almost all viruses directly enter to brain via the spinal cord within 10&#8211;30&#160;min, while few viruses enter the brain through the bloodstream via tail vein injection at the same time. Spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly delays the HSV&#8208;1 transport from skin to brain but has no effect on the virus's travel from blood to brain. In a microfluid system, HSV&#8208;1 shows preferential neurite infection, then transports to the cell body of differentiated SH&#8208;SY5Y cells, highlighting the viral traffic process in neurons. The integration of CQDs&#8208;virus labelling technology and dMN delivery model presents a promising tool for investigating the in vivo transport routes of neurotropic viruses with initial skin infections.

Prior&#8208;relithiation regulates the competitive dynamics of the direct regeneration process by increasing the oxygen vacancy formation energy, thereby achieving ideal direct regeneration.








Abstract
Direct regeneration, as a promising technology for recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion battery materials, fundamentally involves replenishing missing components in degraded materials to promote structural reconstruction. Current methods to achieve lithium replenishment typically rely on lithium salt conversion at high temperatures. However, the inherent lithium deficiencies in spent cathode materials trigger lattice oxygen loss under thermal conditions, exacerbating structural degradation and hindering further relithiation. The conflicts between relithiation and thermal decomposition are the key to limiting the regeneration effect. Due to insufficient understanding of the competitive mechanisms among the various reactions in direct regeneration, avoiding these conflicts by strategy design remains challenging. Herein, this study elucidates the sequence and dynamic evolution of critical reactions in direct regeneration, identifying a previously unknown prior&#8208;relithiation process that occurs at significantly lower temperatures. By promoting this prior&#8208;relithiation process, the oxygen vacancy formation energy of spent cathode materials is increased, stabilizing the cathode material structure and mitigating thermal decomposition during direct regeneration. The regeneration effect is therefore significantly improved, achieving a 15% higher capacity recovery rate and significantly enhanced overall electrochemical performance compared to the normal approach. This study deepens the understanding of direct regeneration mechanisms and offers a scientific foundation for developing advanced direct regeneration strategies.

         <title>Signal Transducer Nanoparticles Enable Siglec&#8208;10/G Blockade Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibody&#8208;free approach to block the &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling is achieved through using the CD24 signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). These STNPs effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.








Abstract
Current treatments for breast cancer (BC), particularly triple&#8208;negative BC, are limited in efficacy due to drug resistance and high recurrence rates. CD24, which is highly expressed in BCs and engages with its receptor Siglec&#8208;10/G (Siglec&#8208;10 in humans and Siglec&#8208;G in mice) on immune cells, represents a promising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) target. As the engagement is mediated by a short signal transducer (ST) peptide displayed on the BC cell surface, targeting the peptide using antibodies has shown to be effective for BC treatment. Herein, an antibody&#8208;free approach is reported to achieve blockade of the CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling through the synthesis of signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). The STNPs can effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of BC cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. The therapeutic effects can be further improved through encapsulation of RRx&#8208;001, a small molecule inhibitor of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling. Compared to the antibody approach, the synthetic nanoparticle approach offers greater efficacy with lower side effects and enables combination therapy through a simple formulation. Moreover, the approach is versatile and could be adapted for targeting other ICB signaling, advancing the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Center Exploration in Atomically Thin MoSxTe2&#8208;x Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering in a closed&#8208;loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoSxTe2&#8208;x alloy catalyst is created through low&#8208;temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 (S&#8208;MoTe2), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Teads&#8208;Mo). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half&#8208;reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S&#8208;MoTe2 alloy compared to its counterparts without Teads&#8208;Mo. This work provides an intelligent approach to facilitate active center exploration in micrographs and achieves a closed&#8208;loop verification for the ML&#8208;assisted defect discovery via theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, displaying how ML and researchers seamlessly cooperate in a scientific workflow for advanced catalyst development.

         <title>Development of 3D Reversible Smart Energy&#8208;Saving Devices for Adaptive Energy Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart energy&#8208;saving devices&#160;with 3D structures operate passively and exhibit reversible solar heating and radiative cooling functions. These devices demonstrate superior performance in building thermal management through dual&#8208;mode operation and provide an optimized 3D energy management platform applicable across various angular environments. The fabricated 3D devices achieved energy savings of 7% and 6% for cooling and heating, respectively, and demonstrate global applicability.








Abstract
Conventional 2D thin&#8208;film&#8208;based energy&#8208;saving devices face limitations in controlling phase transition temperatures and in material selectivity. In contrast, 3D devices offer better temperature tunability and broader material options for surface coatings. However, existing designs still face challenges like limited deformation and asymmetric structures, hindering adaptation to varying sunlight incidence and azimuth angles. This study proposes symmetric 3D devices incorporating a shape memory alloy actuator, black paint for solar absorption, and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/Al2O3 composite as an RC film, exhibiting the following characteristics: i) reversible, continuously tunable 3D mechanical deformation between solar heating (SH) and radiative cooling (RC) modes via a temperature&#8208;responsive actuator; ii) autonomous operation without external power or manual intervention, ensuring energy&#8208;saving functionality; and iii) effective operation across diverse climates with durable, flexible, and adaptable design and adjustable transition temperatures for enhanced thermal responsiveness. Theoretical simulations confirm maximum cooling power reduction of 6.8% in summer and heating power reduction of 5.6% in winter. Performance evaluations under varying tilt angles and solar incidence, along with climate simulations across 15 global zones, validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the device for real&#8208;world applications. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, sustainable, energy&#8208;efficient solution for future architectural and environmental uses.

         <title>Aramid Nanofiber Aerogels: Preparation, Modification, Composite Fabrication, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different forms of aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and especially aerogels from them, offer a sustainable route to high&#8208;performance biomimetic nanocomposites. Due to the cartilage&#8208;like architecture, ANF&#8208;based materials enable breakthroughs in energy, electromagnetic, biomedical, and water purification technologies. This review outlines key advancements, applications, and future directions for ANF&#8208;based structures, including their engineering using graph theory capable of capturing the complex organization characteristic for a variety of high&#8208;performance biomaterials and nanostructured gels.








Abstract
Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) have emerged as versatile and readily accessible building blocks for multifunctional, complex nanostructures. A key motivation for studying and utilizing ANFs lies in their potential to directly recycle commercial macro&#8208;aramid plastics, such as poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide), for diverse applications. Retaining the advantageous properties of parent aramid fibers and fabrics, ANFs enable the creation of a variety of nanostructured solids, both independently and in combination with polymeric and nanoscale components. A wide spectrum of ANF&#8208;based aerogels is developed, many of which exhibit property sets previously unattainable in other materials&#8212;properties critical for advancing sustainable development. These biomimetic composites replicating complex organization of cartilage, combine high toughness, thermal resilience, nanoscale porosity, and low density with the capability for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing. The transformative advancements in materials for energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, thermal management, biomedical implants, water purification, and other applications are spurred by ANF&#8208;based aerogels and related composites. This review summarizes recent progress in the engineering, fabrication, characterization, modification, and implementation of ANF aerogels. It also highlights future research directions, potential applications, and key challenges including the development of structural descriptors for ANF solids, that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of ANF&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Industry&#8208;Compatible Fully Laminated Perovskite&#8208;CIGS Tandem Solar Cells with Co&#8208;Evaporated Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a highly efficient bilayer methylammonium lead iodide perovskite is fabricated using a scalable co&#8208;evaporation technique. This strategy enhances the film's stability, allowing the deposition of a tin oxide buffer layer via atomic layer deposition without damaging the perovskite. Moreover, this approach is compatible for tandem applications, enabling the fabrication of 26.1% efficient fully laminated perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;CIGS thin&#8208;film tandem solar cells could potentially share vacuum&#8208;based production equipment between sub&#8208;cells, reducing CapEx and supply chain dependence while enabling flexible, lightweight designs for versatile photovoltaic applications. However, scalable vacuum&#8208;based fabrication techniques for perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandems remain limited and challenging. Here, a highly efficient and stable bilayer methylammonium lead iodide perovskite fabricated using a scalable co&#8208;evaporation technique is presented. In this bilayer structure, an additional thin layer with an enhanced PbI&#8322; evaporation rate is deposited atop a thick stoichiometric perovskite film. This approach reduces film roughness and improves the contact potential difference at the perovskite interface. For the first time, this interface engineering strategy enhances absorber film stability, enabling the deposition of a SnOx buffer layer via atomic layer deposition without damaging the perovskite layer. The bilayer film is used to fabricate single&#8208;junction solar cells, achieving a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.1%, with over 93% of its efficiency retained after 500 h of continuous maximum power point tracking. Ultimately, its compatibility for tandem applications is demonstrated, leading to the fabrication of fully laminated perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 26.1%, surpassing the current record for monolithic perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandems at the same 1 cm2 active area. The sub&#8208;cells are integrated via POE lamination, a widely adopted industrial process, ensuring compatibility with large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Ligand Field Electronic State Regulation of Monoclinic Prussian White Toward Highly Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel substitution reconfigures the ligand&#8208;field electronic state of monoclinic Prussian White, holding Mn in a low&#8208;spin configuration, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and Mn dissolution. The optimized NLS2&#8208;PW cathode delivers 95 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and 80% capacity retention after 600 cycles, advancing stable, high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In situ characterization and first&#8208;principles calculations verify reduced lattice strain and faster Na&#8314; diffusion.








Abstract
Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) has a high output voltage and is expected to be a promising cathode material for high energy density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the capacity decay problem caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of high&#8208;spin Mn3+ restricts its use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, an elemental modulation strategy is proposed to regulate the electronic state of the ligand field by introducing the nickel element, which can keep the Mn in a low&#8208;spin configuration during cycling to inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller aberration of MnHCF. The nickel&#8208;doped MnHCF (NLS2&#8208;PW) with low&#8208;spin electronic state inhibits the disproportionation and dissolution process of Mn3+ and thus exhibits excellent cycling stability, and its capacity retention is close to 80% after 600 cycles at 2 C with a reduction of the Mn dissolution by &#8776;70%. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the distortion of the MnN6 octahedron in NLS2&#8208;PW is reduced significantly, and the tetragonal phase transition caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the electrochemical process is also effectively suppressed. This work demonstrates an efficient modulation strategy to enhance the performance of the Prussian blue analog cathode of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, being favorable for the design and optimization of relevant PB analogues for SIB applications.

         <title>Polycondensation as a Universal Method for Preparing High&#8208;Density Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a universal bottom&#8208;up polycondensation strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (HD&#8208;SACs) with metal loadings up to 27.5 wt%. Using various metal monomers with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione ligands, it generates atomically dispersed mono&#8208; and bimetallic HD&#8208;SACs. The materials demonstrate high stability in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications, and the method is compatible with automation and scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) present a promising subclass of classic heterogeneous catalysts by maximizing metal dispersion and enhancing efficiency. Although high&#8208;density SACs (HD&#8208;SACs) are reported, their synthesis is typically constrained to specific metal&#8208;support combinations and high&#8208;temperature annealing, limiting their translation to wider applications. Herein, a universal bottom&#8208;up approach for the preparation of mono&#8208; and bimetallic HD&#8208;SACs based on the polycondensation of 1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine with a wide range of metal monomers containing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione ligands is introduced. The synthesized materials are atomically dispersed and exhibit metal loadings up to 27.5 wt% with high structural stability. Their versatility as catalysts is explored in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications. The materials exhibit remarkable stability under operational conditions. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy is scaled up and automated, demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility and laying the groundwork for self&#8208;optimizing data&#8208;driven materials discovery.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Nanotube Array Membrane Generating Ultrahigh Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents high&#8208;density (&#8776;10&#185;&#185; cm&#8315;2) ionic nanotube (INT) arrays self&#8208;assemble by a minimal amount of carboxylic groups (&#8776;0.22 meq&#183;g&#8315;&#185;), driven by a cross&#8208;phase&#8208;miscibility effect of their twinned groups. The INT arrays exhibit excellent anti&#8208;swelling properties and high ion conductivity, enabling ultrahigh osmotic energy conversion (39.5 W&#183;m&#8315;2 under a 500&#8208;fold gradient). This work proposes a novel concept for membrane&#8208;based separation processes.








Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) are critical components in osmotic energy conversion. However, traditional IEMs suffer from disordered nanochannels due to the lack of precise control over the content and distribution of ionic groups, resulting in an inherent trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and conductivity. One promising strategy is constructing high&#8208;density ion channels with minimal ionic groups. Herein, high&#8208;density ionic nanotube (INT) arrays are assembled from tiny carboxylic groups (&#8776;0.22 meq&#183;g&#8722;1), achieving efficient&#160;osmotic energy conversion. Using styrene&#8208;ethylene/butylene&#8208;styrene block copolymers, paired carboxyl groups and tetraphenylethylene (TPE) in the polyethylene/butylene block self&#8208;assemble into a transmembrane cylindrical phase. Driven by the cross&#8208;phase&#8208;miscibility effect of TPE, carboxyl groups aggregate at the cylinder interface, forming INT array membranes with an exceptional density of &#8776;10&#185;&#185; cm&#8315;2. The unique structure is directly observed and further validated by self&#8208;consistent field theory. The INT array membranes exhibit 2 orders of magnitude higher current than the control membrane, and an ultrahigh power density of 39.5 W&#183;m&#8315;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, significantly outperforming the traditional IEMs. This INT design strategy not only provides a promising approach for osmotic energy harvesting but also opens new avenues for advanced membrane&#8208;based separation processes.

         <title>Acousto&#8208;Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)2&#183;2H2O (1, Tc &gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML&#8208;driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.








Abstract
The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real&#8208;life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound&#8208;induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide&#8208;based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)] (BF4)2.2H2O (1) complex with an impressive output peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low&#8208;frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI&#8208;driven voice&#8208;recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Activatable Enzymatic Nanoplatform Incorporated into Microneedle Patch for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia Augmented Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable enzymatic nanoplatform incorporated into microneedle patch is developed for relieving tumor hypoxia augmented photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
The clinical advancement of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces entrenched impediments, particularly the suboptimal solubility of hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) and tumor&#8208;associated hypoxia. Herein, a universally applicable, carrier&#8208;free nanotherapeutic platform is devised in which catalase (CAT) functions dually as a biocatalytic oxygenator and a biocompatible scaffold for PSs encapsulation. Through self&#8208;assembly with diverse hydrophobic PSs&#8212;including 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hexyloxyethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;divinyl&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (HPPH), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and zinc (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8212;CAT forms uniform and stable PS@CAT nanoparticles (NPs), obviating the necessity for supplementary nanocarriers. These nanostructures are embedded within microneedle (MN) patches, facilitating minimally invasive, spatially targeted transdermal administration. The PSs bind to the hydrophobic pocket of CAT within NPs, temporarily suppressing its bioactivity, which is restored upon NPs disassembly in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). This pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; mechanism orchestrates the synchronized release of PSs and reactivation of CAT, which catalyzes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) to generate oxygen (O2), alleviating hypoxia and augmenting O2 availability for PDT. In vivo validation in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model corroborated this approach's therapeutic superiority and biocompatibility. Collectively, the findings delineate a minimalist, multifunctional strategy to simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of PSs and overcome hypoxia in PDT for more efficacious oncologic therapy.

         <title>Alkoxy Side Chain Engineering in Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how alkoxy side chains influence COF properties to enhance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Incorporating varying alkoxy groups improves hydrophilicity and modulates the electronic structure via p&#8208;&#960; conjugation. Notably, longer alkoxy side chains facilitate fine&#8208;tuning of the COFs' electronic states, resulting in enhanced ORR activity that outperforms previously reported metal&#8208;free COFs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gain significant attention as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process in energy conversion technologies like fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. While substantial efforts are devoted to unravelling the mechanisms, by which heteroatom&#8208;containing building blocks in linkers, vertices, and linkages, enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, the potential of side&#8208;chain engineering to modulate pore wall surfaces and optimize the catalytic environment remains largely underexplored. This study investigates the role of alkoxy side chains in modulating the properties of COFs to enhance ORR performance. The synthesized COFs have adjustable pore surfaces, integrating triazine rings and alkoxy groups to enhance channel hydrophilicity by modulating interactions with water molecules. Moreover, the alkoxy side chains act as electron donors through p&#8211;&#960; conjugation, creating active and tuneable electronic sites, further enhancing hydrophilicity and facilitating efficient catalytic cycles. Notably, COFs with longer alkoxy side chains exhibit superior ORR activity, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77&#160;V, surpassing previously reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhancement is because of the stronger binding affinity of water molecules and *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the alkoxy side chains.

         <title>Photoinduced Plasmon Electron Transfer&#8208;based Bioorthogonal Cleavage Reaction for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatiotemporally controllable photocatalytic cancer therapy is developed using a PiPET&#8208;based bioorthogonal cleavage of allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated MB. Pd&#8208;conjugated Au nanobipyramids enhanced catalytic activity, achieving a ninefold increase in MB release. This system demonstrates precise tumor suppression via photothermal and PiPET effects, offering innovative, targeted therapy.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reactions have been harnessed to develop advanced medical solutions for transformative cancer therapy. However, their limited catalytic activities within biological environments must be enhanced to maximize their potential in practical applications. Here, a spatiotemporally controllable photocatalytic cancer therapy is reported through the photoinduced plasmon electron transfer (PiPET)&#8208;based biorthogonal cleavage reaction of a pro&#8208;photosensitizer, allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated methylene blue (MB). The electron transfer in Pd&#8208;conjugated Au nanobipyramids is examined to improve catalytic activity by simulating the energy differences between the desorbed and adsorbed states, bond distances, and charge densities with and without excess electrons. A significantly enhanced release of allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated methylene blue is achieved by ninefold and demonstrated precise spatiotemporal control of the bioorthogonal reaction in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo studies reveal the remarkable tumor&#8208;suppressing capability of the bioorthogonal system, which is attributed to the photothermal and PiPET effects, coupled with the prevention of leuko&#8208;MB formation. The PiPET&#8208;based bioorthogonal cleavage reaction can offer an innovative solution for precise tumor therapy using spatiotemporal phototherapeutic strategies.

         <title>Polarization Signal Amplification of 2D GeSe&#8208;Based Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based amplification circuit is developed to significantly enhance the polarization ratio (PR) of 2D GeSe polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, improving PR from 2.1 to 54.8 (over 25&#8208;fold enhancement). This amplified polarization signal directly contributes to higher recognition accuracy in defect detection systems, concurrently reducing the computational costs of convolutional neural networks (CNN)&#160;by over 60%.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on&#8208;chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation&#8208;dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization&#8208;induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT&#8208;Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high&#8208;PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.

&lt;p&gt;Polarization-sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer-free polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on in-plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on-chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation-dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in-plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&amp;lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field-effect transistor (FET)-based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization-induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT-Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high-PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high-resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>mTORC1 Selective Nano&#8208;Inhibitor by Disrupting the Lysosomal Arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208; mTORC1&#8208;CDKs Axis for Precision Bladder Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A strategy for mTORC1 specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway is presented. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a paradigm, nanomedicines like ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO are developed. They degrade Arg in lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 and mTORC1.








Abstract
The absence of precise targeting and defined mechanisms, akin to small molecules, remains a major barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism, is linked to abnormal activation in various diseases like cancers. While small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of mTORC1 are limited, they remain a focus. Here, a strategy is presented for mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine (Arg)&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a universal paradigm, nanomedicines are developed (e.g., ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO) that degrade Arg in the lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 activation and blocking mTORC1 recruitment. ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO inhibits mTORC1 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.07 ng mL&#8722;1), with three orders of magnitude greater specificity than the clinical small molecule rapamycin. SLC38A9 knockout abolishes nanomedicine efficacy. Differential responses to the inhibitors are also observed in normal and bladder cancer cells, linked to SLC38A9 expression levels, suggesting potential for precise treatment of non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In vivo, ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO combined with photodynamic therapy outperformed MMC in preventing tumor recurrence and extending survival. This work establishes a promising approach for developing mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors with well&#8208;defined targets and mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of precision nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

         <title>Flippase&#8208;Mediated Hybrid Vesicle Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p flippase in small and giant polymer lipid hybrid vesicles is illustrated. The hybrid vesicles show adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate consumption and flipping of 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. This induced transmembrane asymmetry results in constriction and division of the giant hybrid vesicles.








Abstract
The assembly of synthetic systems with the ability for protein&#8208;mediated division remains a challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here, the reconstitution of an active Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p lipid flippase in polymer lipid hybrid vesicles (HVs) made from phospholipids and 1 or 2.5 mol% amphiphilic block copolymers, with poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) or poly(6&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose) as the hydrophilic extension and either cholesteryl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate or combinations thereof as the hydrophobic blocks is demonstrated. The reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p in HVs flip 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine (DOPS) lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet, leading to transmembrane asymmetry. Importantly, the chemical nature of the hydrophobic block in the amphiphilic block copolymers used to assemble the HVs is crucial to support changes in the spontaneous curvature of the bilayers due to translocation of DOPS lipids that results in HV constriction and division. Taken together, this effort is a step forward in imitating cell division in synthetic assemblies toward potentially bottom&#8208;up assembled self&#8208;replicating units.

         <title>Enhanced Control of Liposomal Drug Release by Drug&#8211;Aptamer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an aptamer&#8208;enhanced liposomal drug release platform is developed that controls the release of various drugs through a mechanism involving both specific drug affinity and impedance of diffusion. As in vivo proof of principle, this platform provides prolonged local anesthesia for up to 6.6 d following a single dose of tetrodotoxin (TTX) injected at the sciatic nerve in rats.








Abstract
Conventional diffusion&#8208;controlled drug delivery systems (DDS) can have undesirable initial burst release, leading to potential systemic toxicity, and the rate of basal release can deplete content, shortening the duration of effect. Here, it is hypothesized that conventional drug delivery systems&#8212;using liposomes as an example&#8212;can be enhanced by incorporation of an aptamer that binds specifically to the encapsulated drug. Affinity of the aptamer to the drug within liposomes (Lipo&#8208;Apt) would slow release. It is demonstrated that this approach works with a range of relatively small and hydrophilic molecules, including tetrodotoxin (TTX), serotonin (Ser), and kanamycin (Kan). The in vivo utility of this system in providing prolonged local anesthesia with TTX injected at the sciatic nerve in rats is further demonstrated. A single injection of TTX&#8208;loaded Lipo&#8208;Apt results in 6.6 d of nerve blockade, a fourfold improvement over the duration achieved by liposomes without aptamers, and 26&#8208;fold over the aptamer&#8211;drug complex. In part, the improved efficacy of Lipo&#8208;Apt is also due to slower release reducing systemic toxicity, which allows delivery of larger drug doses. These studies demonstrate that Lipo&#8208;Apt is a promising approach to enhancing control of release of drugs by DDS, reducing toxicity and enhancing duration of effect.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research develops a fluoro&#8208;containing graft copolymer whose side chains can be selectively &#8220;disintegrated&#8221; into monomers and &#8220;re&#8208;grafted,&#8221; in which both the &#8220;ungrafted&#8221; backbone polymer and &#8220;regenerated&#8221; graft copolymers can be utilized for different high&#8208;value applications. The demonstration using fluoropolymer provides a potential solution to alleviate the environmental concerns of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;typed polymeric materials.









Abstract
The intrinsic chemically inert fluoropolymers, constitute a large portion of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), granting them unique properties and prolonged lifetime while also bring substantial environmental concerns. This study develops fluoro&#8208;containing graft copolymer with closed&#8208;loop and selective recyclability of side chains. The poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;CTFE) backbone is modified via 4&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohol (VBOH) units and then grafted by poly (trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) side chains, yielding the graft copolymer with improved ionic conductivity and enhanced mechanical robustness, demonstrating it as a polymer electrolyte for battery application. The selective deconstruction of PTMC side chains from graft copolymer affords the recycled backbone with a high dielectric constant and superior resistance to harsh environments, suitable for capacitor fabrication and anti&#8208;corrosion coating. The reconstructed graft copolymer exhibits comparable electrochemical performance for related applications. Such a strategy not only deals with PFAS&#8208;based polymeric wastes but also diversifies the application scenarios of typical copolymers.

         <title>Bimodal Spin Switch Emerging from Hybridized 2D MoS2/Ferromagnet Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a novel integration of 2D semiconductors with ferromagnets using pulsed laser deposition, revealing hybridization&#8208;driven spin manipulation. Vertical spin valves with MoS2 and Ni(111) show exotic bimodal spin signals and strong deviations from Julli&#232;re's model. These results highlight the &#171;&#160;2D spinterfaces&#160;&#187; key role in unlocking 2D materials&#8217; potential for advanced spintronic applications and novel spin functionalities.








Abstract
Over the past decade, MRAMs developments have focused on improving magnetic tunnel junctions while using magnetic electrodes with fixed properties as spin sources. Interestingly, 2D semiconductors offer interface tailoring opportunities for spin valve devices, with many atomically thin materials now available. However, integrating them with oxidation&#8208;prone spintronics materials remains a challenge. Here, spin devices are fabricated and evaluated with large&#8208;scale MoS2 directly grown on a monocrystalline ferromagnetic spin source. While most spin transport experiments with 2D semiconductors focus on their isolated dielectric properties, the presented approach unlocks an additional spin manipulation opportunity from MoS2 hybridization with ferromagnetic electrodes. The experimental results show a substantial tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) value of over 65%, an order of magnitude higher than previously observed for exfoliated 2D semiconductor&#8208;based devices. A non&#8208;monotonic dependence of the spin signal on the applied bias, including a sign reversal, is also uncovered, which is attributed to the modulation of the MoS2 band structure by the ferromagnetic electrode. Ab initio calculations support these findings by illustrating how the MoS2 band structure evolves upon hybridization, introducing a pronounced exchange&#8208;induced spin splitting and resulting in an unusual bimodal spin response. This study demonstrates the unique spin manipulation opportunities offered by 2D semiconductors unlocked by direct integration.

         <title>Enhanced Ising Superconductivity and Emergent Ferromagnetism Coexisting in Bimolecule&#8208;Intercalated Bulk TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers report the coexistence of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism in TBAC/DMF&#8208;intercalated TaS2, accompanied by a quantum Griffiths singularity. This structure results in an enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity, with the in&#8208;plane upper critical field reaching five times the Pauli limit and the superconducting temperature increasing to &#8776;2.7 K. Distinct ferromagnetic ordering persists from below the superconducting temperature up to 365 K.








Abstract
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive in most cases. Here the observation of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexisting is reported in a bimolecule (tetrabutylammonium chloride and dimethylformamide, or TBAC/DMF)&#8208;intercalated bulk TaS2, with the exotic phenomenon of quantum Griffiths singularity. It is first shown that the neighboring TaS2 layers are separated by 14.7 &#197;, indicating vertical stacking of the TBAC and DMF molecules. Such a record&#8208;large interlayer spacing renders each TaS2 layer to be of exceptionally 2D nature in an otherwise 3D structure, as manifested by substantially enhanced Ising superconductivity with in&#8208;plane upper critical field five times the Pauli limit. The corresponding superconducting transition temperature is &#8776;2.7 K, more than tripled from that of pristine bulk TaS2 (&#8776;0.8 K), and again approaches that of monolayer TaS2 (&#8776;3 K). Strikingly, distinct ferromagnetism is observed below the superconducting temperature, and the ferromagnetic order persists all the way up to 365 K. These findings characterize TBAC/DMF&#8208;TaS2 as a fertile platform for exploration of rich physical phenomena with significant technological potentials in superconducting spintronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction methods, optimization strategies and application scenarios of Janus electrospun membranes (JEMs) with different structures are systematically summarized. The underlying functional principles and key mechanisms are analyzed. The practical challenges and bottlenecks faced are explored in detail to guide future researchers.








Abstract
Janus electrospun membranes (JEMs) exhibit irreplaceable advantages in advanced functional nanofiber materials. However, as an emerging concept, their profound connotations and academic value have not yet been fully recognized by the scientific community. Herein, the broad scope and relevant categories of JEM are first defined. Subsequently, the construction methods of JEMs with different layers and structures become the focus of summarization and discussion. The enhancement of interlayer bonding forces through various chemical and physical strategies, considered as the core challenge in this field, is classified and compared. Furthermore, according to different asymmetric properties, the applications of JEM in fields such as functional clothing, clean energy, and intelligent sensing are systematically reviewed. The construction methods, functional principles, and key mechanisms of JEM in various application scenarios are deeply analyzed. Finally, the practical challenges and technical bottlenecks JEM faces in large&#8208;scale preparation, performance optimization, cross&#8208;disciplinary applications, and other aspects are explored in detail, providing inspiration and guidance for promoting the technological breakthroughs and industrial transformation of JEM technology.

         <title>Active Biopaste for Coral Reef Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preserving coral reefs is essential. A conductive, hardening paste for coral attachment and mineral accretion technology is developed, using a bio&#8208;based acrylate soybean oil matrix and graphene nanoplatelets. Corals are attached with and onto the conductive paste, electricity is applied, water electrolysis is induced, and calcium is deposited at the cathode to enhance coral growth via faster calcium carbonate deposition.








Abstract
Preserving coral reefs is crucial for safeguarding marine biodiversity, global ecosystems, and coastal communities. Coral restoration focuses on farming and transplanting corals back onto reefs. However, traditional attachment methods, such as petroleum&#8208;based epoxy, pose environmental risks or provide inefficient affixation. Moreover, maximizing coral growth while farming boosts the restoration rate of the reefs. Hence, an environmentally friendly, conductive hardening bicomponent paste is developed to transplant and anchor corals, provide them with a solid growing substrate, and enable mineral accretion technology (MAT), a strategy to accelerate coral farming. The bicomponent paste consists of bio&#8208;based and biodegradable acrylate soybean oil matrix and graphene nanoplatelets fillers. The paste hardens through mixing, transitioning from a Young's modulus of &#8771;0.1 to &#8771;60&#160;MPa and reaching a strength of &#8771;5&#160;MPa. Rheological tests demonstrate the tunability of the crosslinking dynamics of the paste. The paste exhibits a resistivity of 0.1 &#937;&#8729;m, with stable electrical properties for over 40 days in seawater. MAT tests show significant enhancement of coral growth rates within two weeks, doubling those of the control group. This paste offers versatility for application in aquaria and nurseries, does not require prone&#8208;to&#8208;oxidation metallic structures underwater, and can be employed on reefs.

Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields
The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS2 basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number 2411211 by Hyeong&#8208;U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In article number 2414596 by Emre B. Boz, Ameya Bondre, Ronald de Bruijne, and Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.

Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks
The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod&#8208;shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co&#8208;workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number 2501946.

More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202501946"&gt;2501946&lt;/a&gt;.

Flame Treatment
A rapid and scalable high&#8208;temperature flame technique is developed to enable surface reconstruction of sulfide semiconductor photoelectrode for enhanced photoelectrochemical(PEC) performances. In article number 2403164, Sung Sik Shin, Xiaolin Zheng, Sun Cho, and their team demonstrate rapid surface reconstruction of Indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode using the flame process. The flame process transforms the In2S3 surface into a 5 nm&#8208;thin In2O3 layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <title>Natural and Nature&#8208;Inspired Biomaterial Additives for Metal Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys natural biomaterials and nature&#8208;inspired artificial materials as additives for metal halide perovskite films in optoelectronics, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. It discusses how these biomaterials differ from conventional materials in terms of their impact on device performance from both mechanistic and functional viewpoints. Although solar cell applications dominate, reports on other applications are rapidly increasing.








Abstract
This comprehensive review meticulously categorizes and discusses the applications of diverse biomaterials, specifically natural and nature&#8208;inspired synthetic materials in metal halide perovskite optoelectronics. Applications range from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. Emphasis is placed on the intricate interactions between bio&#8208;additives and perovskite crystals, highlighting their influence on the grain size, crystal orientation, grain boundaries, and surface passivation. This review also explores the advantages and disadvantages of each natural or nature&#8208;inspired material and their unique properties compared with conventional additives. Special attention is given to the mechanistic and functional viewpoints, showing how these biomaterials enhance device performance. Through additive engineering with ecofriendly biomaterials, defects in metal halide perovskite thin films can be effectively passivated, thus extending the photostability or in some cases mechanical flexibility of devices. This review provides valuable insights for selecting and designing next&#8208;generation biomaterial additives, offering new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite layers and advancing the field of peorvskite&#8208; based optoelectronics.

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Material Selection and Device Design of Scalable Flexible Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces: A Balance Between Electrical and Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the balance between electrical and mechanical performance of flexible BCIs through the careful selection of electronic materials and probe design to achieve long&#8208;term stable neural recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) hold the potential to revolutionize brain function restoration, enhance human capability, and advance our understanding of cognitive mechanisms by directly linking neural signals with hardware. However, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid BCIs and soft brain tissue limits long&#8208;term interface stability. Next&#8208;generation BCIs must achieve long&#8208;term biocompatibility while maintaining high performance, enabling the integration of millions of sensors within tissue&#8208;level flexible and soft, stable neural interfaces. Lithographic fabrication techniques provide scalable thin&#8208;film flexible electronics, but traditional electronic materials often fail to meet the unique requirements of BCIs. This review examines the selection of materials and device design for flexible BCIs, starting with an analysis of intrinsic material properties&#8212;Young's modulus, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant. It then explores the integration of material selection with electrode design to optimize electrical circuits and assess key mechanical factors. Next, the correlation between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed to guide material selection and device design. Finally, recent advances in neural probes are reviewed, highlighting improvements in signal quality, recording stability, and scalability. This review focuses on scalable, lithography&#8208;based BCIs, aiming to identify optimal materials and designs for long&#8208;term, reliable neural recordings.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature-induced ring-patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring-shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight-binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature-induced changes in spin-orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <title>Conductive Polymer Coatings Control Reaction Selectivity in All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Targeted Nanoparticles with PI3K/mTOR Dual Inhibitor Downregulate P&#8208;Glycoprotein and Inactivate Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self&#8208;doped PEDOT (S&#8208;PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&#8722;3), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Mechanically resilient hydrogels with ion&#8208;electron mixed transport properties effectively bridge biology with electronics. An ideal bioelectronic interface can be realized through introducing electronically conductive polymers into supramolecular hydrogels. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have limited mechanical properties and ion&#8208;electron interactions. Here, supramolecular conductive hydrogels that possess homogeneous ionic and electronic transport are achieved. The materials demonstrate high toughness (620&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), stretchability (&gt;1000%), softness (10.5&#160;kPa), and conductivity (5.8&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which surpasses commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based hydrogels. The homogeneous network leads to higher charge injection capacitance and lower skin impedance compared to commercial electrodes or commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS conducting networks. This significant advance arises from the homogeneous incorporation of the hydrophilic self&#8208;doped conducting polymer S&#8208;PEDOT, which has polymerized within a supramolecular polymer network template mediated by high&#8208;binding affinity host&#8208;guest crosslinks. Furthermore, the compatibility of S&#8208;PEDOT with hydrophilic secondary networks enables the realization of fully dryable and reswellable electronic devices, facilitating reusability and improving their ease of handling. It is anticipated that achieving such material architectures will offer a promising new direction in future synthesis and implementation of conductive hydrogels in the field of&#160;bioelectronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Torque Magnetization Switching Due to Spin Berry Curvature Generated by Minute Spontaneous Atomic Displacement in a Weyl Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer magnetization switching with a small critical current density of &#8776;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is demonstrated. The strong intrinsic spin Hall effect, causing the switching, is induced by the synergy of the inherent spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the spontaneous oxygen octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.The findings highlight the immense potential for realizing efficient material systems for spin&#8208;orbitronics applications by precise atom positioning.








Abstract
Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach is not applied to devices; generally, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT&#8208;induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single&#8208;crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight&#8208;binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single&#8208;crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin&#8208;orbitronics devices.

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two&#8208;photon lithography&#8208;assisted molding, magnetic soft double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini&#8208;turbine assembly, and high&#8208;speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine.

     alt="Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double-reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid-repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high-speed actuation in amphibious environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard-to-reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two-photon lithography-assisted molding, magnetic soft double-reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini-turbine assembly, and high-speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non-magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Regulation of Adhesion/De&#8208;Adhesion/Release Capacity of Transparent and Electrochromic Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation-on-&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high-throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real-time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF-7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA-MB-231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono-cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer-endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitigating Surface Energy and Core&#8208;Shell Interface Strain of Yb3+&#8208;Doped ZnSe&#8208;Based Quantum Dots for Pure&#8208;Blue Emission QLED Devices</title>

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Non&#8208;Reciprocal Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact and efficient on&#8208;chip isolator is experimentally demonstrated by integrating magneto&#8208;optical InSb onto a terahertz silicon topological chip. The simultaneous breaking of spatial and temporal reversal symmetries forms a valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal waveguide mode, enabling a compact cavity size of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2 and a low insertion loss of 2.6 dB, with actively tunable isolation ratios up to 64.3 dB.








Abstract
Chip&#8208;scale non&#8208;reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non&#8208;reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto&#8208;optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time&#8208;reversal and spatial&#8208;inversion symmetries, enable ultra&#8208;compact and efficient non&#8208;reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3&#160;dB and a low chip loss of 2.6&#160;dB is experimentally achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the non&#8208;reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2. An all&#8208;optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48&#160;dB. The development of a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

         <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque&#8208;driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer&#8208;twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE&#8208;NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE&#8208;NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance 721 nm&#8208;Excitable Photon Upconversion Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Broad&#8208;Range Oxygen Sensing and Efficient Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion porous aromatic frameworks (UC PAFs) was constructed and applied to a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and efficient heterogeneous photoredox catalysis. Moreover, homogeneous triple exciton energy is recognized to facilitate exciton diffusion, resulting in a high upconversion quantum yield (1.5% with an upper limit of 50%).








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;wavelength excitable solid upconversion materials and the regulation of exciton behavior is important for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and other emerging applications. However, the approaches for regulating exciton diffusion are very limited, resulting in extremely poor photonic upconversion performance in solid&#8208;state. Here, the annihilation unit is integrated into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and loaded with photosensitizer to construct efficient 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion material (upconversion quantum yield up to 1.5%, upper limit 50%). Most importantly, we found that the steric hindrance of annihilator units breaks the &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the annihilation unit and the PAFs framework to form the homogeneous triplet exciton energy, which is conducive to the exciton diffusion. After increasing the exciton diffusion constant from 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 to 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1, the upconversion quantum yield is increased &#8776; 50&#8208;fold. Further, this solid upconversion material is utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and 721 nm&#8208;driven heterogeneous and recyclable photoredox catalysis. These findings provide an important approach for regulating the behavior of triplet exciton in disorder solid materials to gain better upconversion performance, which will advance practical applications of organic photon upconversion in energy, chemistry, and photonics.

         <title>Revealing Trapped Carrier Dynamics at Buried Interfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Infrared&#8208;Modulated Action Spectroscopy with Surface Photovoltage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spectroscopy technique (i.e., pump&#8208;push&#8208;surface photovoltage) is introduced that monitors trapped carrier dynamics at the buried interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) via combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization. 








Abstract
Interfacial engineering is a proven strategy to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by controlling surface electronic defects and carrier trapping. The trap states at the &#8220;top&#8221; interface between the perovskite and upper charge extraction layers are experimentally accessible and have been extensively studied. However, the understanding of the unexposed &#8220;bottom&#8221; surface of the perovskite layer remains elusive, due to the lack of selective and non&#8208;destructive tools to access buried interface. Here, a new spectroscopy technique is introduced that monitors nanosecond to millisecond dynamics of trapped carriers at the buried interfaces by combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. Applied to various PeSC architectures, this method reveals that most interfacial traps reside between the perovskite and hole transport layer, suggesting a predominance of hole traps (e.g., cation and lead vacancies) over electron traps (e.g., halide vacancies) in the studied PeSC systems. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector in metal&#8208;free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X&#8208;ray detector achieves ultra&#8208;high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskite (MFP) X&#8208;ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X&#8208;ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X&#8208;ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE&#8208;NH4Br3 H2O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;103 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (&#8208;55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>

A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.

         <title>Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Molybdenum Nitride Monoliths at the Centimeter Scale Surpass Platinum for all pH Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN monoliths with unsaturated Mo&#8211;N coordination structures are fabricated through solid&#8208;state phase transformation. The porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long&#8208;term stability across all&#8208;pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.








Abstract
Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Centimeter-sized porous single-crystalline MoN monoliths with unsaturated Mo&#8211;N coordination structures are fabricated through solid-state phase transformation. The porous single-crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long-term stability across all-pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution. Free&#8211;standing PSC MoN electrode with the pore size of &#8776;6&#160;nm and porosity of &#8776;72% present both noble&#8211;metal&#8211;like electronic structure and unsaturated Mo&#9472;N coordination structures at surface, contributing to remarkably high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Energy Transfer Loop Enables Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with &gt;20% EQE and Near&#8208;Zero Roll&#8208;Offs at 104 Nits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence diodes with the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% and the record&#8208;low EQE roll&#8208;off of only 2.6% at 104 nits is first realized through an &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy, in which a TADF sensitizer 24DDMACPPPO with vibration&#8208;free reverse intersystem crossing is used to displace TADF emitter in triplet&#8208;singlet up&#8208;conversion for phonon decoupling, leading to markedly enhanced radiation and suppressed quenching.








Abstract
The bottleneck in efficiency stability at high luminance limits the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes, due to the insufficient management of quenching factors, especially exciton&#8208;phonon coupling during reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) assistant with vibrational coupling. Herein, this challenge is overcome by a TADF sensitizer based &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy. A dimethylacridine&#8208;phosphole oxide hybrid sensitizer named 24DDMACPPPO is constructed with vibration&#8208;free RISC and excited&#8208;state energy levels equal to a TADF emitter 4CzTPNBu. The former displaces the latter in RISC for phonon decoupling through reverse triplet and positive singlet energy transfer between them. As a result, co&#8208;doping 0&#160;.1%wt. 24DDMACPPPO doubles the RISC rate constant and triples the singlet radiation rate of 4CzTPNBu, and simultaneously nearly halves non&#8208;radiation rate constants, giving rise to 70% and 90% increased photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies of 4CzTPNBu. More importantly, the energy transfer loop between 24DDMACPPPO and 4CzTPNBu combines their advantages in RISC, quenching suppression, and singlet radiation, giving rise to the record values of external quantum efficiency (&#8776;23%wt.) and roll&#8208;off (2.6%) at 104&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

         <title>Synergistic Interface Engineering via o&#8208;Difluorobenzene&#8208;Mediated HPWO Crystallization and ITO Fluorination for 20.57% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;action optimization strategy is developed combining the fluorination of ITO electrodes with precisely controlled crystallization of phosphotungstic acid, which establishes favorable energy level alignment and reduces interface trap density to obtain 20.57% efficiency of organic solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial energy loss is a critical challenge in achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), primarily due to mismatched energy levels and inefficient charge collection. Herein, a bifunctional interface engineering strategy is proposed, employing an ethanol/o&#8208;difluorobenzene (EtOH/o&#8208;DFB) dual&#8208;solvent system for phosphotungstic acid (HPWO) processing. During film formation, o&#8208;DFB regulates HPWO crystallization by suppressing excessive aggregation, while enabling in situ ITO fluorination through the adsorbed o&#8208;DFB. This synergistic approach simultaneously mitigates the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer while enhancing the electrode work function, resulting in better ohmic contact, minimized trap&#8208;state densities, and improved energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer interface. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated across multiple active layer systems. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 19.55%, 20.07%, and 20.57% are achieved for PM6/L8&#8208;BO, D18/L8&#8208;BO, and D18/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs, respectively. Notably, the 20.57% PCE represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for OSCs, highlighting the potential of this bifunctional interface engineering strategy in advancing high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O-, S-, and N-bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non-aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non-aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p-&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N-based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first-class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O-, S-, and N-bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microbial Photosynthetic Oxygenation and Radiotherapeutic Sensitization Enables Pyroptosis Induction for Combinatorial Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) via a solid&#8208;phase synthesis method, combined with cyanobacteria (Cyan) to effectively alleviate hypoxia. These components are confined within the tumor microenvironment using a thermosensitive hydrogel, enhancing the sensitivity of radiotherapy for colorectal and lung cancers. By alleviating hypoxia through cyanobacteria&#8208;mediated photosynthetic oxygenation, La2O3 NPs not only promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, triggering pyroptosis via GSDMD activation, but also amplify radiotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis mediated by GSDME. This dual mechanism provides a powerful strategy to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced radiotherapy resistance in colorectal and lung cancers.








Abstract
Rectal cancer surgery is challenging due to the complex anatomy, making it difficult to achieve clear surgical margins. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role, especially in treating locally recurrent rectal cancer and preserving anal function. However, its effectiveness is often limited by tumor hypoxia, particularly prevalent in hypoxic regions near the bowel wall in colorectal cancer. Hypoxia contributes to both radiation resistance and apoptosis resistance, compromising RT outcomes. To overcome hypoxia&#8208;driven radiotherapy resistance, this work designs and engineers a radiotherapy&#8208;sensitizing bioplatform for efficient cancer RT. It combines lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) with cyanobacteria, which produces oxygen through photosynthesis. This bioplatform uniquely reduces tumor hypoxia, enhances radiation deposition, and improves RT efficacy. La2O3 NPs further enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by radiation, triggering pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway, while RT amplifies pyroptosis through GSDME, circumventing tumor apoptosis resistance. The further integrated thermosensitive hydrogels ensure precise localization of the bioplatform, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic specificity. Compared to conventional therapies, this dual&#8208;action system addresses hypoxia, RT resistance, and apoptosis resistance more effectively. In vivo and in vitro hypoxia models validate its potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, offering valuable insights for refining clinical treatment paradigms.

         <title>AI&#8208;Generated Ammonium Ligands for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning procedure combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) model are used to accelerate the generation of ammonium ligands (ALs) in 2D perovskites. The relationship between the carrier transport barrier and the structure of ALs is explored. Utilizing the AI&#8208;designed ALs significantly enhances the carrier transport of the 2D perovskites, leading to high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable stability, but the quantum well in the 2D perovskite capping layer hinders the carrier transport, thereby lowering the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The relationship between the transport barrier and the complex structure of ammonium ligands (ALs) is currently poorly understood, thus leading to the one&#8208;sided approach and inefficient process in the development of 2D perovskite. Here, a machine learning procedure is established to comprehensively explore the relationship and combined it with an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on reinforcement learning algorithm to accelerate the generation of ALs. Finally, the AI&#8208;designed ALs improved the carrier transport performance of the 2D perovskite capping layer, and we achieved a certified PCE of 26.12% in inverted PSCs. The devices retained 96.79% of the initial PCE after 2000 h operation in maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#176;C.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Customized Multifunctional Additive Regulates 1.67 eV&#8208;Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Crystallization for Four&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract
Natural products are a crucial resource for drug discovery, but poor understanding of the molecular&#8208;scale mechanisms of their self&#8208;assembly into soluble, bioavailable hydrogels limits their applications and therapeutic potential. It is demonstrated that Zingibroside R1 (ZR1), derived from Panax notoginseng, undergoes spontaneous self&#8208;assemble into a hydrogel comprising helical nanofibrils with potent antifungal activity lacking in its monomeric state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that facilitates ZR1 nanofibril formation, characterized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior architecture, which underpin its binding activity with cell wall in the vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) pathogen, C. albicans. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 gel and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in VVC model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus, synergistically inhibiting VVC and restoring the vaginal microenvironment. This study advances the mechanistic understanding of ZR1's structure&#8208;function relationships, offering valuable insights into the rational design and therapeutic optimization of natural product&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fluorinated Ni Single Atom Catalyst for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, synergistic spatial and electronic structure regulation of conjugated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts are achieved through a dual&#8208;fluorination strategy. Under diluted CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni obtains the highest reported CO yield (30344.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with 98% CO selectivity.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO2 from flue gas into high value&#8208;added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual&#8208;fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 to CO. Under a dilute CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual&#8208;fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO2 adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual&#8208;F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni&#8208;N2O2 active site to capture CO2 molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Deposition of Antigen Peptides on Bifidobacterium for Subintestinal Lymphatic System&#8208;Guided Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to target gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#160;at mucosal sites. This targeted approach strengthens both mucosal and systemic immunes responses. These immune responses enable the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and progression.








Abstract
Gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) possesses a highly specialized immune system and is rational as a foothold for oral tumor vaccines. Here, a noninvasive oral vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to engage GALT, inducing both intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity for tumor therapeutics. The vaccine uses Bifidobacterium (Bif) as a delivery vehicle for tumor antigen peptides, which are coated with antigen peptides (OVA) and oxidized curdlan (Ocur) in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) manner. Upon oral administration, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur is efficiently directed to Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestines and further presented to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) to evoke specific T cell responses. In mouse models, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur effectively boosts the production of secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) and promotes a strong mucosal and systemic immune response, leading to significant tumor suppression and resistance to tumor challenges. Importantly, the vaccine shows no systemic toxicity. This approach to harnessing the intestinal mucosal immune system offers valuable insights for the development of other non&#8208;invasive oral vaccines and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Photogenetic&#8208;Like Liposomes Disrupt Neuroligin&#8208;3 Dependency to Enhance Glioma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a light&#8208;responsive liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA that synergizes photothermal therapy (CuS/980&#160;nm) with dual NLGN3 regulation: RuBi&#8208;GABA/UCNPs suppress NLGN3 synthesis via Cl&#8315; channels, while GI254023X inhibits ADAM10&#8208;mediated release. In glioma models, this strategy blocks PI3K/Wnt pathways, reduces stemness, and prolongs survival through combined neuromodulation&#8208;photothermal effects.








Abstract
Neuronal activity is shown to potentiate glioma initiation, progression, and/or metastasis. A key mechanism in neural regulation of brain cancer involves the activity&#8208;dependent cleavage and release of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin&#8208;3 (NLGN3). Here, this report describes the preparation of optogenetics&#8208;like liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA, which is used to regulate the content of NLGN3 in neurons and mediate phototherapy in cancer cells. Lip&#8208;CuRA contains upconversion nanoparticles encapsulating CuS (CuS@PUCNPs), a visible light&#8208;activated neurotransmitter prodrug RuBi&#8208;GABA, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10) inhibitors GI254023X. Upon 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of CuS not only induces tumor cell apoptosis, but also destroys liposome structure, releasing Rubi&#8208;GABA and GI254023X. The UCNPs convert the 980&#160;nm laser into 540&#160;nm, activating RuBi&#8208;GABA into GABA. GABA selectively opens Cl&#8315; channels in nerve cells, reducing the expression of NLGN3 and the degree of axonal connections. GI254023X inhibits the activity of the ADAM10 enzyme on the nerve surface, reducing the release of NLGN3, thereby blocking the transmission of proliferation and stemness signals. In the GL261&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, C6&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, and glioma patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model, Lip&#8208;CuRA effectively inhibits tumor recurrence, reduces glioma stemness, and extends survival through a synergistic photothermal and NLGN3&#8208;regulating therapy.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Nanocathode for Synchronized Generation of Picosecond Pulsed Electron Beam and Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au&#8208;on&#8208;Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation. The nanocathode achieved 80 MHz electron pulses with a 500 ps pulsewidth, 0.91 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 peak current density, 6.53% external quantum efficiency, and 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 reduced brightness. Additionally, it exhibited a 7.1&#176; divergence angle and 0.97 eV energy spread under low excitations. Synchronized radiation pulses at 2.3, 5.7, and 9.2 GHz corresponded to electron pulse features. The excellent performance stems from plasmonic field enhancement and efficient hot electron generation driven by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the PMEE nanocathode. The dynamic effects of high&#8208;energy hot electron injection at the Au&#8208;Gr interface also play a critical role. This system enables compact, room&#8208;temperature, low&#8208;power vacuum electronic devices for ultra&#8208;high spatiotemporal resolution and high&#8208;frequency applications, driving progress in materials science and nanotechnology.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

         <title>Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.








Abstract
This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high&#8208;fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non&#8208;overlapped domains with nearest&#8208;neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration.

     alt="Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high-fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non-overlapped domains with nearest-neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration. The application of these models to the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset reveals their efficiency and the recognizability of decompressed images, which is validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In particular, Model B2, a version of Model B, emerges as an effective method for balancing high information density (surpassing over 20 times the typical densities of two bits per nucleotide) with reasonably good image quality. These findings highlight the potential of DNA-based data storage systems for high-density and efficient compression, indicating a promising future for biological data storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Ferroelectric Stochasticity in 2D CuInP2S6 and Its Application for True Random Number Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a true random number generator (TRNG) based on stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D CuInP2S6 materials, is reported. The TRNG exhibits exceptional stochastic variability, surpassing conventional entropy metrics, and passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. Moreover, TRNG's unclonability is demonstrated through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, providing resilience against machine learning (ML) attacks.








Abstract
True random number generators (TRNGs), which create cryptographically secure random bitstreams, hold great promise in addressing security concerns regarding hardware, communication, and authentication in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS&#8208;based TRNG is circuit&#8208;integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption.

2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

         <title>Percolative Metal Microweb&#8208;Based Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Fast Charging and High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer.

Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb&#8208;based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials.

&lt;p&gt;A novel percolative metal microweb-based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three-dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium-ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium-ion diffusion, and electron transfer. As a result, the lithium-ion battery developed here exhibits exceptional energy and power densities of 110 and 1048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible and high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade-offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb-based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three-dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium-ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness-to-weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb-based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials. The design of the electrode proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of wearable and flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra&#8208;Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer&#8208;scale semiconductor applications.








Abstract
The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO2/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy&#8208;based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically&#8208;thin carbon. Additionally, I&#8208;V characterization and high&#8208;frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer&#8208;level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer&#8208;free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.

&lt;p&gt;The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra-thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy-based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically-thin carbon. Additionally, I-V characterization and high-frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer-level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer-free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8210;Nickel Dual Active Sites Enabled Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium at 180&#160;&#176;C with Exceptional Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Decoding the Role of Molecular Orientation in Conjugated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates how the molecular orientation of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) governs work function (WF) modulation via alignment of the conjugated core with the surface normal. Edge&#8208;on&#8208;oriented BCZ&#8208;1 molecule maximizes vertical dipole moments and achieves dense in&#8208;plane coverage, enabling ultrafast hole extraction and minimized recombination. The resultant binary organic photovoltaics achieve a record efficiency of 19.93%, highlighting orientation engineering as a pivotal strategy for high&#8208;performance devices.








Abstract
Molecular orientation stands as the quintessential hallmark of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have recently catalyzed noteworthy advancements in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, an unambiguous understanding of these directional arrangements and their impact on optoelectronic properties remains elusive. To address this issue, herein three SAMs with representative orientations, i.e., edge&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;1), tilt&#8208;on (4PACz) and face&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;2) are meticulously designed. These orientations have been rigorously validated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations. Remarkably, an unequivocal correlation between the molecular orientation and the device performance is discerned. Particularly, the edge&#8208;on oriented BCZ&#8208;1 exhibits the largest dipole moment normal to the electrode, accompanied by a dense and uniform coverage. These features collectively contribute to its strongest work function increment for ultra&#8208;fast hole extraction and minimum interfacial carrier recombination. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.93% is achieved in devices based on BCZ&#8208;1 with D18:L8&#8208;BO as the active layer, representing one of the highest values reported for binary bulk heterojunction OPVs. Besides, BCZ&#8208;1 shows great potential for practical applications due to its superior up&#8208;scalability and enhanced device shelf&#8208;stability. Overall, this work offers in&#8208;depth insights into the orientation behaviors of SAMs, opening new avenues to unlock the efficiency potential of OPVs.

         <title>Imaging the 4D Chemical Heterogeneity of Single V2O5 Particles During Charging/Discharging Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally&#8208;resolved dual&#8208;mode spinning&#8208;disk confocal microscopy is developed to monitor the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. A unique and irreversible transformation of V5+ to V3+ on a particle's bottom electric contact points has been unveiled for the first time. The coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed to inhibit V3+ precipitation effectively.








Abstract
Microparticle cathode materials are widely used in secondary batteries. However, obtaining dynamic chemical heterogeneities of these microparticles is challenging, hindering in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of the underlying processes. For example, although vanadium pentoxide shows promise as an electrode material for zinc ion batteries, its poor performance's root cause is elusive. Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual&#8208;mode spinning disk confocal microscopy&#8208;based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. Dual&#8208;mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V3+ species at the bottom interface of the V2O5 electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed for inhibiting V3+ precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Proposing Altermagnetic&#8208;Ferroelectric Type&#8208;III Multiferroics with Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiferroics are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Here, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space&#8208; inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin&#8208;ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next&#8208;generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto-optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next-generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Energetics Reversal Strategy for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy&#8208; &#8220;interfacial energetics reversal&#8221; to reconstruct perovskite energetics that matches well with the upper hole transport layer has been successfully developed, enabling efficient n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells with nonradiative recombination induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV from the radiative limit.








Abstract
Reducing heterointerface nonradiative recombination is a key challenge for realizing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Motivated by this, a facile strategy is developed via interfacial energetics reversal to functionalize perovskite heterointerface. A surfactant molecule, trichloro[3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)propyl]silane (TPFS) reverses perovskite surface energetics from intrinsic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type, evidently demonstrated by ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies. The reconstructed perovskite surface energetics match well with the upper deposited hole transport layer, realizing an exquisite energy level alignment for accelerating hole extraction across the heterointerface. Meanwhile, TPFS further diminishes surface defect density. As a result, this cooperative strategy leads to greatly minimized nonradiative recombination. PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.9% with excellent reproducibility, and a nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV, which is the smallest reported to date in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.

         <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;type Ru nanocrystal with co&#8208;crystalline structure possesses an efficient bridge adsorbed hydrogen configuration (*Hbridge) at the Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) interface. The *Hbridge dominates HER and exhibits superior intrinsic activity, &#8776;10.6 times higher than that of Pt. The designed Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) with *Hbridge demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability for both laboratory and industrial levels.








Abstract
Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate (*Hbridge) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc)) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring *Hbridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to *Hbridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8201;&#160;cm&#8722;2) and high turnover frequency (56.4&#8201;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ugPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61&#160;V at 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1000&#160;h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80&#160;&#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58&#160;V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm&#8722;2. This finding highlights the key role of *Hbridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an ultra-long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active-site-switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-solid-state Zn-air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy-to-cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy-wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super-ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high-performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium-entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record-low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate-ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super-ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active-sites-switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion-conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell-level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an ultra-long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.

         <title>Soft Extrudable Dendritic Particles with Nanostructured Tendrils for Local Adhesion and Drug Release to Bladder Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft dendritic particles (SDPs) made of biodegradable polymers and small&#8208;molecule drugs are manufactured using a fluid flow templating method. In alginate gels, extruded SDPs sustainably adhere on tumor sites and selectively kill cancer cells. Intravesical instillation of SDPs in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse bladders triggers a CD45+ immune response with minimal toxicity, highlighting their potential for targeted cancer therapy.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a leading cause of cancer&#8208;related mortality, yet current intravesical drug delivery methods often suffer from poor retention times in the bladder. Gecko feet&#8208;like nanomaterials offer the potential to overcome this challenge, however, conventional methods to fabricate high surface area nanomaterials for drug delivery involve complex and expensive manufacturing processes. In this work, a simple fluid flow templating method is reported for manufacturing soft dendritic particles (SDPs) composed of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) with a chitosan coating for enhanced adhesion to epithelial tissues via van der Waals interactions. The biodegradable SDPs encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents and are administered using an alginate hydrogel, enabling precise deposition by extrusion for sustained drug release. The results demonstrate that SDPs adhere to mouse and human cancer cells for several days. The SDPs effectively encapsulate and release several clinically utilized chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine, docetaxel, and methotrexate, exhibiting superior cancer cell killing in vitro. In murine models, gemcitabine&#8208;loaded SDPs instilled into tumor&#8208;bearing bladders elicited stronger CD45+ immune cell responses than control groups while maintaining minimal toxicity. This work presents a simple, biomimetic drug delivery platform with prolonged retention and controlled drug release, offering a versatile approach for enhancing therapeutic delivery in epithelial cancer models.

         <title>Valence and Site Engineering Enable Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at 960 nm in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Forsterite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent material (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr,5%Li) with efficient (EQE = 48%) ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM &#8776; 2413 cm&#8722;1 (226&#160;nm)) NIR emission at 960&#160;nm upon blue&#8208;light excitation. This innovation addresses the low efficiency of long&#8208;wavelength (&#955;max &gt; 900&#160;nm) NIR&#8208;emitting materials due to the radiationless de&#8208;activation and the low absorption efficiency of Cr3+ activators.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light sources hold great potential for applications in night vision illumination, bio&#8208;imaging, and non&#8208;destructive testing. However, radiationless de&#8208;activation and low absorption restrict the development of high&#8208;efficiency blue light excitable NIR phosphors, especially for emissions beyond 900&#160;nm. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cr3+&#8208;activated forsterite (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr3+, 5%Li+) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li+ as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr4+ formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr3+ d&#8208;d forbidden transitions in Mg2SiO4. More importantly, Li+ promotes excited&#8208;state energy transfer between Cr3+ emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non&#8208;destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.

         <title>Engineering a Lipid Nanoparticle with Atypical Calcium Crystal Structure for Enhanced IFN&#946;&#8208;Mediated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The engineered lipid nanoparticles (NanoCa) demonstrate potent anti&#8208;tumor effects by activating type I interferons, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, and enhancing antigen presentation.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy; however, many patients exhibit suboptimal responses, which is due to inadequate T cell priming by the innate immune response. Metal ions play a critical role in modulating the innate immune response. However, the mechanisms by which metal ions facilitate dendritic cell maturation through the activation of interferon remain poorly understood. This research identifies a nanomaterial Calcium phosphate&#8208;containing liposome (NanoCa), characterized by an atypical crystal structure and pH&#8208;responsive profile. NanoCa promotes bone marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cell maturation and exhibits antiviral effects and anti&#8208;tumor properties in different tumor models. Also, NanoCa acts as an immunostimulant by fostering antibody production. Furthermore, when combined with programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD&#8208;1)&#160; blocking antibodies, NanoCa synergistically enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy in CT26 models. Mechanistically, NanoCa rapidly releases Ca2+ via the lysosome pathway post&#8208;endocytosis, subsequently triggering interferon through the Ca2+&#8208;calcineurin (CaN) &#8208; nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc2) &#8208; protein kinase C beta (PKC&#946;) &#8208; interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signal pathway. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) shows NanoCa increases the population of tumoral infiltrating dendritic cell (DC), C1qc+ TAM, and CD8T_eff cells and decreases the CD8T_ex and immunosuppressive SPP1+ TAM population in tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes. Overall, NanoCa shows translational potential for anti&#8208;tumor immune therapeutics.

Mechanistically, NanoCa rapidly releases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via the lysosome pathway post-endocytosis, subsequently triggering interferon through the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-calcineurin (CaN) - nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc2) - protein kinase C beta (PKC&#946;) - interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signal pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) shows NanoCa increases the population of tumoral infiltrating dendritic cell (DC), C1qc+ TAM, and CD8T_eff cells and decreases the CD8T_ex and immunosuppressive SPP1+ TAM population in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Overall, NanoCa shows translational potential for anti-tumor immune therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1D Van Der Waals Superlattices for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D PbI2 superlattice are synthesized utilizing an antisolvent diffusion method, in which demonstrates in&#8208;plane anisotropic phonon vibrations and optical transport characteristics. Leveraging on the anisotropic optical transport nature and effective coupling with vdWMs, filter&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector comprising vdWMs and PbI2 superlattice waveguide are realized in a broad spectra range with linear dichroism ratio values of 1.43&#8211;1.73.








Abstract
The ability to detect polarimetric information of light over a broad spectra range is central to practical optoelectronic applications and has been successfully demonstrated with photodetectors of low&#8208;symmetry 2D van der Waals materials (vdWMs). However, polarization sensitivity within such a photodetectors remains elusive due to the limited diversity. To address this challenge, an approach is proposed by transforms 2D Lead iodine (PbI2) into 1D superlattice microwires (SLMs) through a solution&#8208;phase antisolvent diffusion method. This structural shifting enables the creation of low&#8208;symmetry crystal characteristics, a well&#8208;defined geometric microcavity structure, and an increased bandgap, which collectively confer anisotropic waveguide properties across visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. By integrating PbI2 SLMs with isotropic 2D vdWMs, that waveguide&#8208;integrated photodetectors are demonstrated capable of polarization detection, achieving linear dichroism ratio (LDR) values of 1.66 at 405&#160;nm for PbI2 photodetectors and 1.73 at 785&#160;nm for WSe2 photodetectors. This paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy enables polarimetric information detection using isotropic vdWMs and advances the development of next&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;resolved optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Adaptive Stress Response in 2D Graphene@Se Composite toward Ultra&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accumulation of stress leads to electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, resulting in rapid capacity loss of solid&#8208;state batteries. A stress&#8208;adaptive graphene@selenium cathode is developed in this work to enhance ion transport and relieve mechanical stress in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;selenium batteries, enabling superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (ASSLSeBs) offer high energy density and improved safety for next&#8208;generation energy storage. Still, selenium cathodes suffer from large volume changes during cycling, leading to mechanical stress and rapid capacity fade. To address this, a stress&#8208;adaptive 2D graphene@Se composite cathode is developed, where small Se nanoparticles are anchored onto acid&#8208;treated expanded graphite (AcEG) to enhance charge transport and alleviate stress. Mechanical characterization confirms that the composite effectively mitigates Li&#8208;ion&#8208;induced strain. As a result, ASSLSeBs with this cathode achieve exceptional cycling stability with ultrahigh capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 2&#160;C and stable performance for over 400 cycles even under high active&#8208;material loading. Furthermore, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;Se pouch cell with a record energy density of 376.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated, the highest reported for ASSLSeBs. This work presents a strategy for designing stress&#8208;adaptive cathodes, enabling ultra&#8208;stable ASSLSeBs for practical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Discovery of Carrier Biomaterials with Ultra&#8208;Low Nonspecific Protein Adsorption for Single Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;evolving discovery integrating automation and AI is developed to address the high&#8208;dimensional&#8208;parameter&#8208;space challenge in carrier biomaterials. The discovered biomaterials showed ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload; and they are further fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity. This study has potential for applications in single&#8208;cell analysis.








Abstract
Carrier biomaterials used in single&#8208;cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self&#8208;evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self&#8208;developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a &#8220;can&#8208;do&#8221; capability, and develop a synergy&#8208;enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a &#8220;can&#8208;think&#8221; capability for small&#8208;data problems inherent to time&#8208;consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single&#8208;cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

         <title>Stochastic Orientational Encoding via Hydrogen Bonding Driven Assembly of Woven&#8208;Like Molecular Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach utilizing a nanoscopic film of a novel rod&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;architecture, achieved through facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing. Energetically favorable molecular assembly, driven by directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs and uniaxial microcrystal growth, results in a woven&#8208;textured pattern with random 1D features. The rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and crystal orientations coupled with artificial coloration enable high encoding capacity in a single&#8208;material, solution&#8208;processed system.








Abstract
The prevention of counterfeiting and the assurance of object authenticity require stochastic encoding schemes based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs). There is an urgent need for exceptionally large encoding capacities and multi&#8208;level responses within a molecularly defined, single&#8208;material system. Herein, a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach is demonstrated using a facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing of a molecular thin film based on the rod&#8208;shaped oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) (OPE) &#960;&#8208;architecture. The nanoscopic film, derived from the small molecule 2EHO&#8208;CF3PyPE with donor, acceptor, and &#960;&#8208;spacer building units, is designed for energetically favorable uniaxial molecular assembly and crystal growth via directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs at the molecular termini and short C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contacts at the center. A facile solvent vapor annealing induces concurrent dewetting and microscopic 1D random crystallization, yielding a woven&#8208;textured random features. Using convolutional neural networks, the rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and stochastic encoding of 1D crystal orientations generate artificial coloration, achieving an encoding capacity reaching (6.5 &#215; 10&#8308;)(2752 &#215; 2208). The results demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving ultrahigh encoding capacities in a thin film composed of a single&#8208;material. This approach enables low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processed fabrication for mass production and broad adoption, while opening new opportunities to explore molecular&#8208;PUFs through structural design and engineering noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Observation of Z2 Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in Projective Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;protected Z&#8322; non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is experimentally demonstrated in acoustic metamaterials. By implementing projective mirror symmetry&#8212;which enables pseudospins in spinless systems&#8212;both uniform and bidirectional Z&#8322; NHSEs characterized by different accumulation directions are observed. Active feedback circuits provide the requisite non&#8208;Hermitian gain/loss, establishing a platform for topological wave manipulation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at the boundary of non&#8208;Hermitian lattices, has gained significant attention in various fields. This phenomenon, driven by the point&#8208;gap topology of complex energy bands, occurs even without special symmetries. Nevertheless, additional symmetry may significantly enrich the NHSE. Notably, time&#8208;reversal symmetry protects a Z2 NHSE, featuring oppositely accumulated skin modes. Here, a 1D bilayer Z2 NHSE model based on projective mirror symmetry is proposed, making Z2 NHSE possible in spinless systems. Experimentally, both uniform and bidirectional Z2 NHSEs are observed in acoustic metamaterials, where the necessary non&#8208;Hermitian elements&#8212;gain and loss&#8212;are achieved through active feedback circuits. These findings open new avenues for exploring symmetry&#8208;enriched non&#8208;Hermitian topological phenomena and pave the way for potential applications in wave manipulation, sensing, and beyond.

         <title>Nanocrystal&#8208;Nucleus Template Strategy for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Homogeneity and Energy&#8208;Level Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template strategy addresses nanoscale phase separation and energy&#8208;level mismatch in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. By tailoring nanocrystals to match the target perovskite's composition and structure, this approach enables uniform halide distribution, enhanced crystallization, and improved electron extraction. The strategy achieves 23.4%&#8208;efficient PSCs (1.68 eV) with a record VOC of 1.30 V and certified 31.7%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are critical for advancing tandem solar cell efficiencies, yet suffer from severe photovoltage deficits and halide segregation, substantially degrading their performance and stability. Here, a nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template (NCNT) strategy is developed to directly addresses heterogeneous nucleation&#8212;the root cause of phase separation&#8212;by precisely matching the I/Br ratio of nanocrystal to that of the target perovskite film. This approach guides homogeneous assembly of Pb&#8208;I/Br octahedra, achieving exceptional halide uniformity and precise crystallization control for WBG films. The NCNT simultaneously induces p&#8208;type doping and reduces the perovskite/C60 interfacial energy barrier, significantly enhancing charge extraction. Remarkably, 1.68&#8208;eV WBG PSCs fabricated via this approach achieve a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.30&#160;V, alongside a champion efficiency of 23.4%. The broad applicability of this strategy is demonstrated across a wide bandgap range of 1.63&#8211;1.76&#160;eV, all exhibiting (001)&#8208;preferred orientation and exceptional photostability. When integrated into a 0.945 cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, the NCNT&#8208;based device delivers a high efficiency of 32.0% (certified 31.7%). This work highlights the pivotal role of nanocrystals in regulating perovskite crystallization, resolves long&#8208;standing VOC limitations in WBG perovskites, and establishes a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and tandem photovoltaics.

         <title>Superblack Carbon Hierarchitectures for Multispectral Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superblack carbon hierarchitectures are developed through synergistic cross&#8208;dimensional engineering that integrates physical structuring with chemical modification, enabling high&#8208;performance multispectral absorption across visible, infrared, and microwave regimes simultaneously. Carbon microparticles with a fractal dimension approaching 1.0, or those possessing a networked structure, inherently offer advantages in achieving broad and strong multispectral responses.








Abstract
Multispectral absorbing materials that can efficiently dissipate waves across the visible, infrared, and microwave regimes have long been pursued for advanced applications in fields such as space exploration, stealth, and camouflage. However, the wide range of incident wavelengths, spanning five orders of magnitude, presents a significant challenge for the practical implementation of multispectral absorbers. Herein, superblack carbon hierarchitectures (SCHs) are designed using a bottom&#8208;up approach involving the self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sacrifice of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), realizing synergistic morphological customization and dielectric gene editing (via carbon nitride like&#8208;moieties conjugated with C&#9552;C short chains). Through the cross&#8208;dimensional coupling action between light&#8208;trapping hierarchitecture and robust dielectric loss, superb visible light absorption (&gt;99.6%), high infrared absorption (98.5%/97.5%/99.6% for long&#8208;/mid&#8208;/short&#8208;wavelength infrared regimes), and ultrabroad microwave absorption (effective bandwidth of 8.52&#160;GHz, nearly covering both the X and Ku bands) can be simultaneously achieved in monolayer SCHs&#8208;based absorbers. Furthermore, the topologically transformed structures of SCHs enable a systematic dissection of the longstanding ambiguity surrounding the geometrical effect, revealing the synergistic influence of fractal dimension and interconnection status of microparticles, particularly in the microwave regime. This work introduces a new paradigm for multispectral absorption and advances the understanding of absorption mechanisms for developing next&#8208;generation absorbers.

         <title>Electrospun Lignin/ZnO Nanofibrous Membranes for Self&#8208;Powered Ultrasensitive Flexible Airflow Sensor and Wearable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the novel sensing applications of water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, by using lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes for sensing airflow through output voltage variation. Obtained lignin/ZnO airflow sensors are self&#8208;powered, precise, and quick&#8208;responding, and can be used as wearable devices for breath monitor, surrounding movement sensor, and sweat monitor.








Abstract
The interest and demand for flexible sensors and wearable devices are rapidly growing. The added benefit of electricity generation, enabling gas sensors to be self&#8208;powered, increases the applicability of these devices for flexible and wearable airflow sensors. Inspired by water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, this study explores its potential in sensing applications, which has not yet been explored in detail. Electrospinning technology is used to prepare superhydrophilic lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes with a ZnO nanoparticle layer, capable of generating at least 100&#160;mV (which allows it to power its own signal transduction). The membrane is highly sensitive to variations in airflow, enabling its use as an ultrasensitive and flexible airflow sensor. This sensor demonstrates exceptional performance, including a fast response time (0.65 s), broad detection range (with lower detection limit down to 0.25 and upper detection limit of 3&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1), and extremely high airflow velocity detection accuracy. Beyond these, it can serve as a wearable sensor for sweat monitoring, motion detection, and breath monitoring (to accurately detect breathing rate, intensity and variations in speech). Such self&#8208;powered, ultrasensitive, and flexible lignin/ZnO airflow sensors provide novel potential to advance the development of smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Nanoengineered Wood for Scalable Monolithic Gas Sensor Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by insect olfactory structures, a bionic nanoengineered wood scalable monolithic gas sensor fabrication is developed. By precisely constructing vertical microchannels and sulfur&#8208;vacancy WS&#8322; nanosheets, the wood achieves selective NO&#8322; adsorption and efficient charge transfer. The 3D interdigitated electrodes enhance signal conduction, achieving a detection limit of 50 ppb, demonstrating great potential for scalable manufacturing and wireless gas detection.








Abstract
Insects exhibit exceptional olfactory abilities due to the synergistic interaction between porous sensilla and sensory receptors, optimizing gas transmission and capture. Inspired by this, a scalable structure of WS2&#8208;functionalized nanoengineered wood (WS2&#8208;NEW) for bio&#8208;inspired gas sensors is designed. A multiscale sensing network mimicking insect receptor synergy by in&#8208;situ loading WS2 nanosheets into vertically aligned microchannels formed by lignin removal, integrated with cross&#8208;sectional 3D interdigital electrodes is developed. The nanoengineered wood enables selective NO2 adsorption and optimized charge transfer through engineered gas transport pathways and defect&#8208;rich active sites. With the optimized 3D electrode structure, WS&#8322;&#8208;NEW facilitates rapid gas transmission and real&#8208;time signal transduction, achieving highly sensitive NO2 detection at room temperature with a detection limit as low as 50 ppb. Utilizing wood's processability, WS2&#8208;NEW has demonstrated the potential for large&#8208;scale manufacturing via simple cutting techniques. A wireless sensor watch based on WS2&#8208;NEW for real&#8208;time NO2 detection highlights its potential in wearable devices. This work proposes an innovative strategy for the manufacturing of gas sensors.

Inspired by this, a scalable structure of WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalized nanoengineered wood (WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NEW) for bio-inspired gas sensors is designed. A multiscale sensing network mimicking insect receptor synergy by in-situ loading WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets into vertically aligned microchannels formed by lignin removal, integrated with cross-sectional 3D interdigital electrodes is developed. The nanoengineered wood enables selective NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and optimized charge transfer through engineered gas transport pathways and defect-rich active sites. With the optimized 3D electrode structure, WS&#8322;-NEW facilitates rapid gas transmission and real-time signal transduction, achieving highly sensitive NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; detection at room temperature with a detection limit as low as 50 ppb. Utilizing wood's processability, WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NEW has demonstrated the potential for large-scale manufacturing via simple cutting techniques. A wireless sensor watch based on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NEW for real-time NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; detection highlights its potential in wearable devices. This work proposes an innovative strategy for the manufacturing of gas sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Tensile Strain and Electronic Modulation in Mesoporous PdMo Metallene Nanoveins for Improved Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal ligand adsorption strategy for controllable synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional (1D and 2D) Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts to establish a fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst morphological structure and performance.








Abstract
Unraveling the fundamental determinants of the intrinsic activity of practical catalysts has long been challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the structures and surfaces of such catalysts. Current understandings of intrinsic activity mostly come from model catalysts. Here, a pH&#8208;induced ligand adsorption strategy is developed to achieve controllable synthesis of self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;dimensional PdMo nanostructures, including 1D nanowires, 2D metallenes, and 2D metallene nanoveins. A strong correlation is established between the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the density of grain boundaries. Increased grain boundary density induces more extensive tensile strain, which, in synergy with electronic interactions within PdMo alloys, effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*O to *OH). 2D PdMo metallene nanoveins, featuring the highest grain boundary density and a unique mesoporous structure, exhibit superior ORR activity and mass transport capabilities. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and in situ spectroscopy are employed to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. This work provides fundamental insights into the critical role of grain boundary engineering in enhancing ORR electrocatalysis in Pd&#8208;based nanostructures.

         <title>Spatial Coordination Structure&#8208;Driven Enzyme&#8208;Like Selectivity in Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>

Sun et&#160;al. reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. They emphasize the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are nanomaterials that rely on atomic&#8208;level active sites to efficiently express catalytic functions like natural enzymes. With their outstanding robustness and exceptional atomic utilization, they are among the most competitive nanozymes used to overcome the inherent shortcomings of natural enzymes. However, SAzymes lack the precise structural complexity of natural enzymes and therefore do not exhibit the same level of catalytic selectivity&#8212;a major barrier to fully replacing natural enzymes. Previous studies have primarily focused on summarizing the methods and rules for improving the enzyme&#8208;like activity of SAzymes, while comparatively little attention has been given to their catalytic selectivity. Herein, this work reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. It emphasizes the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports. In addition, the development prospects and current challenges in exploring SAzyme coordination structures are analyzed to provide new inspiration constructing next generation, highly selective SAzymes.

         <title>Unidirectional Electrobending Deformation in Acceptor&#8208;Doped Piezoceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior with a symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped bipolar S&#8208;E curve in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where the bending direction is governed by the pre&#8208;poling direction rather than the applied electric field. We attribute that this unprecedented unidirectional behavior arises from the synergistic interaction between domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers.








Abstract
Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain&#8208;electric field (S&#8208;E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics are reported, where convex bending always occurs along the pre&#8208;poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the (MNb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8722;VO&#183;&#183;$M_{{\mathrm{Nb}}}^{^{\prime\prime\prime}} - V_{\mathrm{O}}^{ \cdot \cdot }$) defect dipoles (where M2+ represents the acceptor&#8208;doped ion in the Nb&#8208; site) in one surface layer during the pre&#8208;poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly&#8208;like symmetrical bipolar S&#8208;E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.

         <title>In Situ Reconstructed Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO Inverse Opals Accelerate Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Kinetics for High Power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO inverse opal catalyst is presented with abundant active sites and optimized electronic structure for the nitrate reduction reaction and high&#8208;power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8211; battery, resulting in the significantly enhanced catalytic reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 (NO3RR) using renewable energy presents a promising strategy to mitigate environmental pollution and produce high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the practical application of NO3RR is hindered by limited active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics, stemming from the complex eight&#8208;electron process. Herein, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO&#8208;2.5 inverse opals (CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5) catalyst featuring a 3D porous network is designed, which provides abundant active sites and an optimized electronic structure to accelerate the NO3RR kinetics for efficient NH3 production. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of ZnO facilitates electron transfer to Cu active sites, increasing charge density and lowering the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH). As a result, CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 exhibits a notable enhancement in NH3 yield (from 0.255 to 0.313&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and Faradaic efficiency (from 85.7% to 95.5%) compared to the Cu/Cu2+1O catalyst. Thanks to its excellent NO3RR activity, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery with the CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 cathode achieves a max power density of 11.93&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study adopts a multi&#8208;dimensional strategy encompassing morphology regulation, electronic structure optimization, and surface/interface engineering, offering new insights into efficient electrocatalyst development and realizing integrated NH3 synthesis and energy output in a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery.

         <title>Precisely Patterning Liquid Metal Microfibers Through Electrohydrodynamic Printing for Soft Conductive Composites and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and minimal defects, which effectively overcomes the limitations of electrospinning. To the best of their knowledge, the patterning resolution achieved in this work is the highest reported for liquid metal particle&#8208;based inks. Applications in soft sensors and soft conductive composites are demonstrated.








Abstract
Liquid metal particle&#8208;based microfibers attract great interest in soft and wearable electronics. The most facile method to fabricate sub&#8208;50&#160;&#181;m liquid metal fiber is electrospinning. However, electrospinning has poor patterning ability and the electrospun fibers have inherent defects, which significantly lowers the electrical conductivity and limits their application. Therefore, better manufacturing methods are needed to precisely deposit high&#8208;quality liquid metal fibers. In this work, an electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with minimal defects and ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m), overcoming the limitations of electrospinning. The patterned liquid metal fibers can be used for soft conductive composites and soft electronics with highly customized microscale features. The conductive composites embedded with these fibers not only exhibit high conductivity (up to 214 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), but also possess nearly strain&#8208;insensitive resistance (7.3% resistance change at 200% strain) and exceptional cyclic stability. Additionally, the potential applications of the liquid metal fibers and composites in soft sensors, stretchable heaters, and transparent electrodes are demonstrated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered &#945; Radionuclide Nanomedicine: Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Multimodal Energy Recycling for Amplified Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanomedicine co&#8208;loading of the &#945;&#8208;emitter 223RaCl2 within iron&#8208;based MOFs is developed. Precisely targeted to mitochondria, it exploits the full decay spectrum to synchronize three therapeutic actions: direct &#945;&#8208;particle ionization, self&#8208;powered catalytic H2O2 generation via secondary electrons, and immunogenic cell death induction. This integrated approach overcomes the limitations of conventional radiotherapy by facilitating effective local tumor ablation and systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity without external energy input.








Abstract
Internal Radionuclide Therapy (IRT) faces significant challenges, particularly the limited controlled penetration depth of conventional &#946; rays and the inefficient targeted delivery of &#945;&#8208;emitters. In this study, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted, self&#8208;powered &#945; radionuclide nanomedicine, and pioneer a groundbreaking &#8220;suborganelle precise radiodynamic immunotherapy&#8221; paradigm that synergistically integrates physical irradiation, catalytic chemistry, and immunomodulation to overcome the historical limitations of IRT is developed. The innovation establishes a &#8220;radionuclide energy internal cycling&#8221; strategy through 223RaCl2 (the first FDA&#8208;approved &#945;&#8208;emitter), unlocking three synergistic therapies from one radionuclide: precise ionizing radiation, self&#8208;powered catalysis, and immunogenic reprogramming. This paradigm uniquely exploits the full decay spectrum (&#945; particles, &#946; electrons, &#947; photons) to synchronize physical, chemical, and biological anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms without requiring external energy inputs, offering a transformative solution to overcome the physical&#8208;biological barriers of IRT and bridge localized eradication with systemic immune regulation.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Model Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Facilitating All&#8208;Climate High&#8208;Voltage Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Based Lithium Metal Batteries with LiBF4&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>

This work engineered a LiF&#8208;rich sandwich&#8208;model cathode electrolyte interphase with LiBxOy&#8208;rich outer and &#8722;C&#8801;N&#8208;rich inner layer via LiBF4&#8208;based partially fluorinated electrolyte with para&#8208;fluorobenzeneacetonitrile additive. This optimized electrolyte formulation and stable cathode electrolyte interphase endows Li||NCM94 batteries with long&#8208;life, high&#8208;voltage, and all&#8208;climate high&#8208;performance, and a record 544 Wh kg&#8722;1 in 7.6 Ah pouch cells with 158&#8208;cycle stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries are highly needed, but remains a huge challenge in cycling life due to the existence of unstable electrode electrolyte interphases, especially with nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage. To address this question, a functional and robust sandwich&#8208;model cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is proposed, derived from a LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte modified with para&#8208;fluorobenzeneacetonitrile (P&#8208;FBCN) additive, to realize the stability of 4.8&#160;V Li||LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) battery operated from &#8722;60 to 60 &#176;C. The LiF&#8208;rich sandwich&#8208;model CEI features an outer layer of LiBxOy&#8208;rich to enhance mechanical/thermal stability, and the inner &#8722;C&#8801;N&#8208;rich anchoring layer to facilitate Li&#8314; conduction and inhibit the dissolution of transition metal ions. Notably, the 7.6 Ah&#8208;grade Li||NCM94 pouch cell with such electrolyte can yield a high energy density of 544&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a long lifespan of 158 cycles.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing of Ultratough and Healable Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer that achieves both excellent mechanical properties (toughness of 158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) and self&#8208;healing performances (healing efficiency of 95.6%), achieved through the ingenious formulation of two dynamic bonds (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the DLP printable resin, making it ideal for flexible and versatile fabrication of complex structures.








Abstract
Although 3D&#8208;printing has offered a promising solution for the freeform fabrication of complex, arbitrary structures, developing elastomeric materials that simultaneously possess mechanical robustness and self&#8208;healing functionality remains a significant challenge. To address this, a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer is reported by the strategic incorporation of hierarchical hydrogen bonding (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the photoactive resin, thereby overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and dynamic functionality. The resulting elastomer exhibits ultra&#8208;toughness (158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), with tensile strength and breaking strain of 49.6&#160;MPa and 1136%, respectively. In addition, the acylsemicarbazide moieties endow the 3D&#8208;printed elastomers with unique dynamic characteristics, including self&#8208;healing capabilities and shape reconfigurability, thus significantly enhancing the design flexibility and versatility of complex structures.

         <title>Regulating Polymeric Adsorption Dynamics via Monolayer&#8208;Architected Hydrotalcite Integration for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular aggregation control strategy utilizing a 2D atomic crystal, hydrotalcite, regulates polymeric adsorption dynamics of donor polymers, achieving an overall efficiency of 20.63%.








Abstract
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the molecular aggregation property of donor&#8211;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures serves as a critical determinant in device performance. Nevertheless, the intrinsic steric constraints imposed by polymeric side chains frequently lead to metastable molecular packing configurations with diminished structural coherence. In this study, a morphological modulation strategy is proposed by adopting a 2D layered hydrotalcite (HDC) nanocrystal to regulate polymeric adsorption dynamics. By leveraging hydroxyl&#8208;directed interfacial coordination to HDC matrices, the nanocrystal&#8208;integrated BHJ systems manifest a pronounced donor&#8208;phase H&#8208;aggregation, synergistically coupled with reduced &#960;&#8208;orbital overlap distances and enhanced long&#8208;range crystalline ordering. These nanoscale structural advancements collectively engender superior charge transfer kinetics with reduced activation energy barriers and improved charge carrier transport properties. The HDC nanocrystal&#8208;blended devices not only achieve a top&#8208;notch power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.63%, but also shows its applicability across various donor &#8211; acceptor BHJ systems. This work develops a crystal&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes nanoscale morphology and charge transport networks in OSCs, yielding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance through synergistic structural&#8208;electronic modulation.

         <title>Neuromorphic Polarization Vision Enabled by Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Photosynaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor using anisotropic organic micro&#8208;crystals is developed to replicate biological polarization vision. A record dichroic ratio of &gt;103 is achieved under ultraweak light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 while operating at the ultralow energy consumption of 0.22&#160;pJ per synaptic event. The artificial visual neuron replicates complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition.








Abstract
Polarization vision, a highly sophisticated visual capability in insects such as butterflies and bees, plays a pivotal role in enabling survival&#8208;critical ecological behaviors, such as navigation, intraspecific communication, mating, and habitat selection. However, the replication of this capability in artificial systems has long been impeded by the limited dichroic ratio (DR, typically &lt; 10) of existing materials and the complexity of conventional optical designs. Here, the first time a bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor is developed based on organic micro&#8208;crystal arrays for neuromorphic polarization vision. By leveraging the polarization&#8208;dependent photogating effect in intrinsically anisotropic organic crystals, the device achieves an unprecedented DR exceeding 103 within a minimal gate&#8208;bias window of 1 V, outperforming existing polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the device successfully mimics the synaptic plasticity of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual neurons, enabling tunable transitions between short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity through a charge&#8208;storage accumulative process. Significantly, it operates with an exceptionally low energy consumption of 0.22 pJ per synaptic event under ultraweak polarized light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2, rivaling the efficiency of biological neural systems. Further it demonstrates the replication of complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition, using this artificial visual neuron. Our work opens new avenues for neuromorphic polarization vision, with broad implications for intelligent neurorobotics and energy&#8208;efficient biomimetic electronics.

         <title>Hierarchically MOF&#8208;Based Porous Monolith Composites for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the design of hierarchical porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting, focusing on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous monoliths. Emphasis is placed on integrating MOF nanoscale porosity with the microscale channels of monolithic scaffolds to enhance sorption&#8208;desorption performance. The role of multiscale porosity, from the nanometer scale to the macrostructure, is highlighted in optimizing water uptake, vapor transport, and stability under varying humidity.








Abstract
Water scarcity, a critical global challenge, has intensified due to the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and its detrimental impact on human activities. Addressing this issue requires solutions capable of providing clean water in regions facing hydroclimatic challenges and limited infrastructure. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising solution, particularly in arid regions, by extracting moisture from the air. This review explores AWH technologies that leverage material porosity and hygroscopicity, focusing on highly porous materials such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and monolithic scaffolds. While MOFs exhibit exceptional water uptake due to their tunable chemistry and nanoscale porosity, their powdery nature poses stability and processability challenges. To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano&#8208;scale in MOF (&lt;2 nm) and micro&#8208;scales (&gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF&#8208;based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large&#8208;scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.

         <title>Bioinspired Immunomodulatory Scaffold Based on Mineralized Lotus Stalks Laden with MnCO Microspheres for Accelerated Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnCo@mPDA&#8208;coated mineralized lotus petiole (MM@MDL3) is developed for skull defect repair. The primary function of MM@MDL3 is to rapidly recruit cells to the bone defect area via its aligned channels. And the MM@MDL3 exhibits strong M2 macrophage polarization by the release of CO and Mn2+ ions, which further enhances angiogenesis and osteogenesis while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and maturation.








Abstract
Bone regeneration remains a significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of the bone healing process and the need for biomaterials that provide both structural support and immunomodulatory functions. Here, a bioinspired immunomodulatory scaffold is developed, composed of mineralized decellularized lotus stalks (MDL) integrated with manganese carbonyl (MnCO)&#8208;loaded mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) microspheres (MM@MDL3). This scaffold mimics the hierarchical architecture of natural bone while offering controlled CO and Mn2+ release, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and enhancing osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrate that MM@MDL3 effectively promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation by activating the BMP2/SMAD/RUNX2 pathway. In vivo rat calvarial defect models confirm significant bone regeneration, with increased bone volume, enhanced vascularization, and reduced osteoclastogenesis. These results demonstrate MM@MDL3 as a promising strategy for large&#8208;segment bone defect repair by integrating a biomimetic structure with immunomodulatory and osteogenic properties. The proposed scaffold has great potential for treating clinical large&#8208;segment bone defects.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Supramolecular Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Silver(I) Metallogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analysis of pyridine N&#8208;oxide&#8208;silver(I) trifluoroacetate complexes reveals remarkable mechanical strengths that enable the creation of free&#8208;standing objects with shape control, reaching dimensions of up to centimeters and shedding new insights into the gelation mechanisms.








Abstract
Twenty&#8208;seven pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) are investigated to evaluate the gelation of their silver(I) trifluoroacetate (AgTFA) complexes across eight solvents. Gelation occurs selectively with PyNOs featuring electron&#8208;donating groups, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing or mixed groups do not form gels. A combination of two different PyNOs, one with an electron&#8208;donating group and the second with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, form a gel, suggesting that gel&#8208;forming PyNO&#8208;AgTFA can override the non&#8208;gelling tendency of PyNOs comprising electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Pyridine&#8208;AgTFA complexes lacking the N&#8211;O group fail to gel, underscoring the crucial role of the N&#8211;O functionality and its coordination with silver(I) in facilitating gelation. The resulting PyNO&#8208;AgTFA gels demonstrate remarkable mechanical strengths, enabling the fabrication of free&#8208;standing and load&#8208;bearing gel shapes, such as rods and horseshoes, with sizes up to several centimeters. The analysis of 65 X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveals that PyNO&#8208;AgTFA complexes manifest four distinct structural motifs, even when crystallized under different solvents and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratios, demonstrating a strong preference for a specific set of silver(I) complexes. X&#8208;ray crystallography and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies predict gel structures without single crystals. Density functional theory calculations of recurring non&#8208;covalent interactions in the crystal structures show interaction energies ranging from &#8722;1 to &#8722;92 kJ mol&#8722;1.
