      <title>Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness</title>
      <dc:description>
The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to gph&#160;= 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.06).








Abstract
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, acting as excellent electron acceptors. The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures.

This study thus provides key strategies to design fullerenes with large chiroptical responses for use as chiral components of organic electronic devices. It is anticipated that this data will position chiral fullerenes as an exciting material class for the growing field of chiral electronic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>High Color&#8208;Rendering Index and Stable White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Assembling Two Broadband Emissive Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
      <dc:description>
Stable and highly luminescent CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites are synthesized through a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. They exhibit white&#8208;light emission through self&#8208;trapped excitons, as well as cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning. By using the composites as a white&#8208;light emitter, electrically driven cold/warm tunable WLEDs with a record color&#8208;rendering index of 91.6 are successfully demonstrated, and a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5 min is achieved.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are promising next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state light sources. However, the commercialization route for WLED production suffers from challenges in terms of insufficient color&#8208;rendering index (CRI), color instability, and incorporation of rare&#8208;earth elements. Herein, a new two&#8208;component strategy is developed by assembling two broadband emissive materials with self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) for high CRI and stable WLEDs. The strategy addresses effectively the challenging issues facing current WLEDs. Based on first&#8208;principles thermodynamic calculations, copper&#8208;based ternary halides composites, CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5, are synthesized by a facile one&#8208;step solution approach. The composites exhibit an ideal white&#8208;light emission with a cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning and a robust stability against heat, ultraviolet light, and environmental oxygen/moisture. A series of cold/warm tunable WLEDs is demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 145&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%, and a record high CRI of 91.6 is achieved, which is the highest value for lead&#8208;free WLEDs. Importantly, the fabricated device demonstrates an excellent operation stability in a continuous current mode, exhibiting a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5&#160;min. The results promise the use of the hybrids of STEs&#8208;derived broadband emissive materials for high&#8208;performance WLEDs.

      <title>A Wearable Nutrition Tracker</title>
      <dc:description>
A wearable nutrient tracker that allows monitoring of vitamin C in sweat, along with urine and blood, to assist tracking users&#8217; nutritional status is demonstrated. A longitudinal study is performed on two individuals to explore correlations of vitamin C concentrations in sweat and urine with blood. It has promising potential applications in nutritional assessment and dietary intervention.








Abstract
Nutrients are essential for the healthy development and proper maintenance of body functions in humans. For adequate nourishment, it is important to keep track of nutrients level in the body, apart from consuming sufficient nutrition that is in line with dietary guidelines. Sweat, which contains rich chemical information, is an attractive biofluid for routine non&#8208;invasive assessment of nutrient levels. Herein, a wearable sensor that can selectively measure vitamin C concentration in biofluids, including sweat, urine, and blood is developed. Detection through an electrochemical sensor modified with Au nanostructures, LiClO4&#8208;doped conductive polymer, and an enzymes&#8208;immobilized membrane is utilized to achieve wide detection linearity, high selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. The sensor allows monitoring of temporal changes in vitamin C levels. The effect of vitamin C intake on the sweat and urine profile is explored by monitoring concentration changes upon consuming different amounts of vitamin C. A longitudinal study of sweat's and urine's vitamin C correlation with blood is performed on two individuals. The results suggest that sweat and urine analysis can be a promising method to routinely monitor nutrition through the sweat sensor and that this sensor can facilitate applications such as nutritional screening and dietary intervention.

      <title>Manipulating the Solvation Structure of Nonflammable Electrolyte and Interface to Enable Unprecedented Stability of Graphite Anodes beyond 2 Years for Safe Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonflammable electrolytes show great advantages over conventional electrolytes in terms of both safety and performance, exhibiting high compatibility with graphite electrodes with the longest cycling performance (&gt;2 years). The electrolyte structure and derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase jointly contribute to the superlong cycling stability of graphite electrode, which highlights the importance of the electrolyte compatibility and the interface.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are attractive for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, in which graphite is one of the most promising anodes. However, the large size and the high activity of K+ ions and the highly catalytic surface of graphite largely prevent the development of safe and compatible electrolytes. Here, a nonflammable, moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte is reported that is highly compatible with graphite anodes and that consists of fire&#8208;retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in a salt/solvent molar ratio of 3:8. It shows unprecedented stability, as evidenced by its 74% capacity retention over 24 months of cycling (over 2000 cycles) at the 0.2 C current rate. Electrolyte structure and surface analyses show that this excellent cycling stability is due to the nearly 100% solvation of TMP molecules with K+ cations and the formation of FSI&#8722;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the decomposition of the solvent molecules toward the graphite anode. Furthermore, excellent performance on high&#8208;mass loaded graphite electrodes and in a full cell with perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode is demonstrated. This study highlights the importance of the compatibility of both electrolyte and the interface, and offers new opportunities to design the electrolyte&#8211;SEI nexus for safe and practical PIBs.

      <dc:description>
Layered PtSe2 holds great promise for industries benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe2 for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe2, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.








Abstract
Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe2, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe2 are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe2, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe2&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.

      <dc:description>
A bilayer of InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process. The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements prove a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN.








Abstract
The properties of 2D InN are predicted to substantially differ from the bulk crystal. The predicted appealing properties relate to strong in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane excitons, high electron mobility, efficient strain engineering of their electronic and optical properties, and strong application potential in gas sensing. Until now, the realization of 2D InN remained elusive. In this work, the formation of 2D InN and measurements of its bandgap are reported. Bilayer InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process in metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The thickness uniformity of the intercalated structure is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) and the structural properties by atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%, and a major part of the intercalated structure is represented by two sub&#8208;layers of indium (In) bonded to nitrogen (N). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements give a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN. The stabilization of 2D InN with a pragmatic wide bandgap and high lateral uniformity of intercalation is demonstrated.

      <title>MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.








Abstract
Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na+, K+) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Design and Sensing Applications of Hemin/Coordination Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
By combining the properties of hemin and porous coordination polymers into novel nanocomposites, different types of sensors can be generated for testing the concentrations of different biological molecules. These biosensors are based on electrochemical, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric techniques, and have excellent detection limits and stability.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic catalysts as substituents for enzymes is of critical interest in the field due to the problems associated with the extraction, purification, and storage of enzymes in sensing applications. Of these mimetics, hemin/coordination polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites, mainly hemin/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), have been developed for various biosensing applications because of the unique properties of each component, while trying to mimic the normal biological functions of heme within the protein milieu of enzymes. This critical review first discusses the different catalytic functions of heme in the body in the form of enzyme/protein structures. The properties of hemin dimerization are then elucidated with the supposed models of hemin oxidation. After that, the progress in the fabrication of hemin/MOF nanocomposites for the sensing of diverse biological molecules is discussed. Finally, the challenges in developing this type of composites are examined as well as possible proposals for future directions to enhance the sensing performance in this field further.

      <title>Tailored Graphene Micropatterns by Wafer&#8208;Scale Direct Transfer for Flexible Chemical Sensor Platform</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy to micropattern 2D materials on large&#8208;scale flexible substrates using direct polymer curing transfer method is demonstrated. Graphene microchannels on polymer substrates exhibit ultrahigh effective self&#8208;heating under the applied bias voltage of less than 10&#160;V. Entirely flexible and transparent chemical sensor array based on graphene micropatterns successfully discriminate gas species under the self&#8208;activated state without external heating.








Abstract
2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit great potential as functional materials for numerous novel applications due to their excellent properties. The grafting of conventional micropatterning techniques on new types of electronic devices is required to fully utilize the unique nature of graphene. However, the conventional lithography and polymer&#8208;supported transfer methods often induce the contamination and damage of the graphene surface due to polymer residues and harsh wet&#8208;transfer conditions. Herein, a novel strategy to obtain micropatterned graphene on polymer substrates using a direct curing process is demonstrated. Employing this method, entirely flexible, transparent, well&#8208;defined self&#8208;activated graphene sensor arrays, capable of gas discrimination without external heating, are fabricated on 4 in. wafer&#8208;scale substrates. Finite element method simulations show the potential of this patterning technique to maximize the performance of the sensor devices when the active channels of the 2D material are suspended and nanoscaled. This study contributes considerably to the development of flexible functional electronic devices based on 2D materials.

      <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip (LFGC) is a novel imaging platform enabling the atomic&#8208;scale observation of liquid&#8208;phase reactions in operando circumstances. Graphene viewing windows and anti&#8208;bulging SiNx supports provide a controllable liquid thickness and structural integrity under harsh experimental conditions. Using LFGC, both atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and molecular&#8208;level information for inorganic and biological samples can be acquired under liquid circulation.








Abstract
The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiNx chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.

      <title>Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphases Enabled Ultralong Life Ca&#8211;Metal Batteries Working at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable Ca plating/stripping process for more than 1000 h is realized through a Na/Ca hybrid SEI strategy. This enables an ultralong life and high operation voltage, up to 4.5 V, for room&#8208;temperature Ca&#8211;metal batteries.








Abstract
Currently, the application of calcium metal anodes is challenged by rapidly degenerated plating/stripping electrochemistry without suitable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) capable of fast Ca2+ transport kinetics and superior ability to resist anion oxidation. Here, through in situ evolved Na/Ca hybrid SEIs, symmetrical Ca//Ca batteries readily remain stable for more than 1000 h deposition&#8211;dissolution cycles (versus less than 60 h for those with pure Ca SEIs under the same condition). Coupled with a specially designed freestanding lattice&#8208;expanded graphitic carbon fiber membrane and tailored operation voltages, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;metal batteries reversibly run for almost 1900 cycles with &#8776;83% capacity retention and a high average discharge voltage of 3.16&#160;V. The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca2+ transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF2 ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.

The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
      <dc:description>
The interplay between phase decomposition and athermal phase transition is leveraged in a Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te ternary system to enable exquisite microstructure features by strong composition fluctuations and coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic GeTe. Specifically, alloying GeTe with Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values &gt; 2.6.








Abstract
Phase transition in thermoelectric (TE) material is a double&#8208;edged sword&#8212;it is undesired for device operation in applications, but the fluctuations near an electronic instability are favorable. Here, Sb doping is used to elicit a spontaneous composition fluctuation showing uphill diffusion in GeTe that is otherwise suspended by diffusionless athermal cubic&#8208;to&#8208;rhombohedral phase transition at around 700 K. The interplay between these two phase transitions yields exquisite composition fluctuations and a coexistence of cubic and rhombohedral phases in favor of exceptional figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit zT. Specifically, alloying GeTe by Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6. These results not only attest to the efficacy of using phase transition in manipulating the microstructures of GeTe&#8208;based materials but also open up a new thermodynamic route to develop higher performance TE materials in general.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Efficient Energy Transfer between Coupled Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) benzoic acid cation is incorporated into perovskite to simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate the defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. Fabricated blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes show an external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min, indicating that this is an effective approach for high device performance.








Abstract
While there has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi&#8208;2D perovskite compositions in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers of the film, which plays very important role for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite layers for promoting coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers. In particular, the strengthened interaction between coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers favors an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic Pb for less nonradiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced properties of ABA incorporated perovskites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a very long operational stability of 81.3&#160;min, among the best performing blue quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs, are achieved. Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high&#8208;performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.

      <title>Machine Learning Predictions of Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Machine learning is used to analyze the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer thin films. The neural networks predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity during solvent annealing, and a ridge regression model identifies the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.








Abstract
Directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers is a key enabler for nanofabrication of devices with sub&#8208;10 nm feature sizes, allowing patterning far below the resolution limit of conventional photolithography. Among all the process steps involved in block copolymer self&#8208;assembly, solvent annealing plays a dominant role in determining the film morphology and pattern quality, yet the interplay of the multiple parameters during solvent annealing, including the initial thickness, swelling, time, and solvent ratio, makes it difficult to predict and control the resultant self&#8208;assembled pattern. Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data. A ridge regression model is constructed to identify the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.

      <title>Self&#8208;Strengthening Adhesive Force Promotes Cell Mechanotransduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Benefiting from the spontaneous merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran isomerization, a coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of the interfacial adhesive force. Cells enable remodeling of the underlaying interfaces to meet their demand for adhesion when the ligand anchoring strength is weak. The subsequent self&#8208;strengthening process offers progressive force stimulation following the adaptation step to mediate cell behaviors and ultimately drive cell fate specification.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes dynamic remodeling and progressive stiffening during tissue regeneration and disease progression. However, most of the artificial ECMs and in vitro disease models are mechanically static. Here, a self&#8208;strengthening polymer coating mimicking the dynamic nature of native ECM is designed to study the cellular response to dynamic biophysical cues and promote cell mechanical sensitive response. Spiropyran (SP) is utilized as dynamic anchor group to regulate the strength of cell adhesive peptide ligands. Benefiting from spontaneous thermal merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran (MC&#8211;SP) isomerization, the resulting self&#8208;responsive coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of interfacial interactions. Comparing with the static and all of the previous dynamic artificial ECMs, cells on this self&#8208;responsive surface remodel the weakly bonded MC&#8208;based coatings to activate &#945;5&#946;1 integrin and Rac signaling in the early adhesion stage. The subsequent MC&#8208;to&#8208;SP conversion strengthens the ligand&#8211;integrin interaction to further activate &#945;v&#946;3 integrin and RhoA/ROCK signaling in the latter stage. This sequential process enhances cellular mechanotransduction as well as the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It is worth emphasizing that the self&#8208;strengthening occurs spontaneously in the absence of any stimulus, making it especially useful for implanted scaffolds in regenerative medicine.

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small&#8208;Molecule Se@Peapod&#8208;Like N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film is prepared as the cathode for K&#8211;Se batteries. The short&#8208;chain Se confined in the micropores is eventually transformed to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process which hinders the generation of polyselenides and promotes complete conversion thus enhancing the utilization of Se.








Abstract
The potassium&#8211;selenium (K&#8211;Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K&#8208;ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K&#8211;Se battery is prepared by employing the small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N &#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short&#8208;chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K2Sen, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.

&lt;/i&gt;, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Definition Single&#8208;Cell Printing: Cell&#8208;by&#8208;Cell Fabrication of Biological Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Conventional bioprinting methods cannot reliably print single cells. A novel microfluidic bioprinting technology with a highly miniaturized cell sorter is presented to accurately print single cells. Through selective cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell printing, intricate cell patterns at single&#8208;cell resolution and uniform spheroids with defined composition and morphology are fabricated.








Abstract
Bioprinting is a powerful technology with the potential to transform medical device manufacturing, organ replacement, and the treatment of diseases and physiologic malformations. However, current bioprinters are unable to reliably print the fundamental unit of all living things, single cells. A high&#8208;definition single&#8208;cell printing, a novel microfluidic technology, is presented here that can accurately print single cells from a mixture of multiple candidates. The bioprinter employs a highly miniaturized microfluidic sorter to deterministically select single cells of interest for printing, achieving an accuracy of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m and speed of &#8776;100&#160;Hz. This approach is demonstrated by fabricating intricate cell patterns with pre&#8208;defined features through selective single&#8208;cell printing. The approach is used to synthesize well&#8208;defined spheroids with controlled composition and morphology. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility of the approach will advance bioprinting to enable new studies in organoid science, tissue engineering, and spatially targeted cell therapies.

      <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. Unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

      <dc:description>
Human stem&#8208;cell&#8208;derived organoids have provided new opportunities to model biological processes and recapitulate organ development. However, organoid systems lack perfusable vascular networks to deliver nutrients and drugs. In article number 2002974, Boyang Zhang and co&#8208;workers introduce IFlowPlate&#8212;a microfluidic system with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design in a 384&#8208;well plate format that can be used to vascularize and intravascularly perfuse organoids. This image shows three independently perfused microvascular networks in an IFlowPlate.

&lt;p&gt;Human stem&#8208;cell&#8208;derived organoids have provided new opportunities to model biological processes and recapitulate organ development. However, organoid systems lack perfusable vascular networks to deliver nutrients and drugs. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202002974"&gt;2002974&lt;/a&gt;, Boyang Zhang and co&#8208;workers introduce IFlowPlate&#8212;a microfluidic system with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design in a 384&#8208;well plate format that can be used to vascularize and intravascularly perfuse organoids. This image shows three independently perfused microvascular networks in an IFlowPlate.

      <title>Optical Patterning: Direct Optical Patterning of Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via In Situ Ligand Exchange (Adv. Mater. 46/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2003805, Dmitri V. Talapin and co&#8208;workers demonstrate photoresist&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution optical patterning of quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes by using photoacid generators that induce photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Uniform electroluminescence patterns of QDs are produced with feature size down to 1.5 &#956;m while preserving the structural, optical, and electronic properties of the patterned QDs. This advanced patterning method can boost the realization of not only QD electroluminescence displays but also other integrated optoelectronic devices using colloidal QDs.

      <title>Relationship between the Processing, Structure, and Properties of Microfibrillar Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are considered as a promising group of environmentally friendly fiber composites, which might replace the commercial glass&#8208; and carbon&#8208;fiber composites in the final applications. A comprehensive overview of the complex processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties relationship for MFCs is presented. It is known that carefully developed microstructure is one of the most important requirements for achieving composites&#8217; good mechanical properties.








Abstract
The relationship between processing, morphology, and properties of polymeric materials has been the subject of numerous studies of academic and industrial research. Finding an answer to this question might result in guidelines on how to design polymeric materials. Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are an interesting class of polymer&#8211;polymer composites. The advantage of the MFC concept lies in developing in situ microfibrils by which a perfect homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement in the matrix can be achieved. Their potentially excellent mechanical properties are strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the fibrils, which is developed through a three&#8208;stage production process: melt blending, fibrillation, and isotropization. During melt blending, the polymers undergo different morphological changes, such as a breakup and coalescence of the droplets, which play a crucial role in defining the microstructure. During processing, various parameters may affect the morphology of the MFCs, which must be taken into account. Besides the processing parameters, the microstructure of the composite is dependent on the composition ratio of the blend and viscosity of the components, as well as the dispersion and distribution of the microfibrils. The objective here is to outline this importance and bring together an overview of the processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship for MFCs.

      <title>Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Donor&#8211;Acceptor sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Polymers as Photocathodes for Water Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A bithiophene&#8208;bridged D&#8211;A&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP&#8208;Th) is synthesized via Knoevenagel polymerization. Benefiting from the robust sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H2.

Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CANDYBOTS: A New Generation of 3D&#8208;Printed Sugar&#8208;Based Transient Small&#8208;Scale Robots</title>
      <dc:description>
Sugars are among the main sources of energy and structural building blocks for almost all forms of life. Because of their degradability and biocompatibility, sugars are compelling materials in transient devices and robotics. An additive manufacturing approach for the production of 3D sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced, which can pave the way for a new generation of transient small&#8208;scale devices.








Abstract
Sugars are ubiquitous in food, and are among the main sources of energy for almost all forms of life. Sugars can also form structural building blocks such as cellulose in plants. Because of their inherent degradability and biocompatibility characteristics, sugars are compelling materials for transient devices. Here, an additive manufacturing approach for the production of magnetic sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced. First, it is shown that sugar&#8208;based 3D architectures can be 3D printed by selective laser sintering. This method enables not only the caramelization chemistry but also the mechanical properties of the sugar architectures to be adjusted by varying the laser energy. It is also demonstrated that mixtures of sugar and magnetic particles can be processed as 3D composites. As a proof of concept, a sugar&#8208;based millimeter&#8208;scale helical swimmer, which is capable of corkscrew motion in a solution with a viscosity comparable to those of biological fluids, is fabricated. The millirobot quickly dissolves in water, while being manipulated through magnetic fields. The present fabrication method can pave the way to a new generation of transient sugar&#8208;based small&#8208;scale robots for minimally invasive procedures. Due to their rapid dissolution, sugars can be used as an intermediate step for transporting swarms of particles to specific target locations.

      <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with High Operational Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) demonstrate high operational performance but poor shelf stability. This work reveals that both positive ageing and negative ageing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs are associated with in situ reactions induced by organic acids. The understanding leads to novel electron&#8208;transporting oxide bilayers to realize shelf&#8208;stable devices with high operational performance.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) promise a new generation of high&#8208;performance, large&#8208;area, and cost&#8208;effective electroluminescent devices for both display and solid&#8208;state lighting technologies. However, a positive ageing process is generally required to improve device performance for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs. Here, it is revealed that the in situ reactions induced by organic acids in the commonly used encapsulation acrylic resin lead to positive ageing and, most importantly, the progression of in situ reactions inevitably results in negative ageing, i.e., deterioration of device performance after long&#8208;term shelf storage. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies focusing on the correlations between the in situ chemical reactions and the shelf&#8208;ageing behaviors of QLEDs inspire the design of an electron&#8208;transporting bilayer, which delivers both improved electrical conductivity and suppressed interfacial exciton quenching. This material innovation enables red QLEDs exhibiting neglectable changes of external quantum efficiency (&gt;20.0%) and ultralong operational lifetime (T95: 5500 h at 1000 nits) after storage for 180 days. This work provides design principles for oxide electron&#8208;transporting layers to realize shelf&#8208;stable and high&#8208;operational&#8208;performance QLEDs, representing a new starting point for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

      <title>A Suspended Silicon Single&#8208;Hole Transistor as an Extremely Scaled Gigahertz Nanoelectromechanical Beam Resonator</title>
      <dc:description>
A silicon single&#8208;hole transistor, a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation electronics, is suspended to function as a nanoelectromechanical resonator, demonstrating a record&#8208;high resonant frequency and large zero&#8208;point motion. The mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing is dominated by the piezoresistive effect with a giant piezoresistive gauge factor strongly correlated to single&#8208;hole tunneling, providing great potential in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations.








Abstract
Suspended single&#8208;hole transistors (SHTs) can also serve as nanoelectromechanical resonators, providing an ideal platform for investigating interactions between mechanical vibrations and charge carriers. Demonstrating such a device in silicon (Si) is of particular interest, due to the strong piezoresistive effect of Si and potential applications in Si&#8208;based quantum computation. Here, a suspended Si SHT also acting as a nanoelectromechanical beam resonator is demonstrated. The resonant frequency and zero&#8208;point motion of the device are &#8776;3&#160;GHz and 0.2&#160;pm, respectively, reaching the best level among similar devices demonstrated with Si&#8208;containing materials. The mechanical vibration is transduced to electrical readout by the SHT. The signal transduction mechanism is dominated by the piezoresistive effect. A giant apparent effective piezoresistive gauge factor with strong correlation to single&#8208;hole tunneling is extracted in this device. The results show the great potential of the device in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations, as well as investigating potential quantum behavior of the vibration phonon mode.

      <title>Shape&#8208;Preserving Chemical Conversion of Architected Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Shaping, sculpting, and forging customizable compounds into arbitrary forms has the potential to revolutionize technologies for advanced functional materials. Understanding ion&#8208;exchange reactions in nanocomposites enables shape&#8208;controlled microscopic architectures with a large diversity of metal chalcogenide compositions that are of interest for their electronic, catalytic, and magnetic properties.








Abstract
Forging customizable compounds into arbitrary shapes and structures has the potential to revolutionize functional materials, where independent control over shape and composition is essential. Current self&#8208;assembly strategies allow impressive levels of control over either shape or composition, but not both, as self&#8208;assembly inherently entangles shape and composition. Herein, independent control over shape and composition is achieved by chemical conversion reactions on nanocrystals, which are first self&#8208;assembled in nanocomposites with programmable microscopic shapes. The multiscale character of nanocomposites is crucial: nanocrystals (5&#8211;50&#160;nm) offer enhanced chemical reactivity, while the composite layout accommodates volume changes of the nanocrystals (&#8776;25%), which together leads to complete chemical conversion with full shape preservation. These reactions are surprisingly materials agnostic, allowing a large diversity of chemical pathways, and development of conversion pathways yielding a wide selection of shape&#8208;controlled transition metal chalcogenides (cadmium, manganese, iron, and nickel oxides and sulfides). Finally, the versatility and application potential of this strategy is demonstrated by assembling: 1) a scalable and highly reactive nickel catalyst for the dry reforming of butane, 2) an agile magnetic&#8208;controlled particle, and 3) an electron&#8208;beam&#8208;controlled reversible microactuator with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Previously unimaginable customization of shape and composition is now achievable for assembling advanced functional components.

      <title>Recent Advances in Growth of Large&#8208;Sized 2D Single Crystals on Cu Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the growth and production of wafer&#8208;scale and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition are presented. The features and roles of Cu in making 2D crystals are comprehensively demonstrated. The daunting quest for mass production of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials poses great potential in electronics and other applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality 2D materials have been an emerging and promising choice for use in modern chemistry and physics owing to their fascinating property profile. The past few years have witnessed inspiringly progressing development in controlled fabrication of large&#8208;sized and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials. Among those production methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn the most attention because of its fine control over size and quality of 2D materials by modulating the growth conditions. Meanwhile, Cu has been widely accepted as the most popular catalyst due to its significant merit in growing monolayer 2D materials in the CVD process. Herein, very recent advances in preparing large&#8208;sized 2D single crystals on Cu substrates by CVD are presented. First, the unique features of Cu will be given in terms of ultralow precursor solubility and feasible surface engineering. Then, scaled growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) crystals on Cu substrates is demonstrated, wherein different kinds of Cu surfaces have been employed. Furthermore, the growth mechanism for the growth of 2D single crystals is exhibited, offering a guideline to elucidate the in&#8208;depth growth dynamics and kinetics. Finally, relevant issues for industrial&#8208;scale mass production of 2D single crystals are discussed and a promising future is expected.

      <title>Coherent Electron Transport in Air&#8208;Stable, Printed Single&#8208;Crystal Organic Semiconductor and Application to Megahertz Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic semiconductor, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, which can be used to form single&#8208;crystalline thin films by printing, is identified as a band&#8208;transport material by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements. The printed PhC2&#8722;BQQDI single crystal is also used to demonstrate a high&#8208;frequency transistor with a capability of 4.3&#160;MHz under ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have attracted growing attention for optoelectronic applications such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), and coherent (or band&#8208;like) carrier transport properties in OSC single crystals (SCs) have been of interest as they can lead to high carrier mobilities. Recently, such p&#8208;type OSC SCs compatible with a printing technology have been used to achieve high&#8208;speed FETs; therefore, developments of n&#8208;type counterparts may be promising for realizing high&#8208;speed complementary organic circuits. Herein, coherent electron transport properties in a printed SC of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type OSC, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction analyses in conjunction with band structure calculations, are reported. Furthermore, the SC FET is tested for high&#8208;speed operations, which obtains a cutoff frequency of 4.3&#160;MHz at an operation voltage of 20&#160;V in air. Thus, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI is shown as a new candidate for practical applications of SC&#8208;based, organic complementary devices.

      <title>Random Polymerization Strategy Leads to a Family of Donor Polymers Enabling Well&#8208;Controlled Morphology and Multiple Cases of High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
To fine&#8208;tune the energy levels of polymer donors, a family of random polymers is synthesized, which shows favorable properties of aggregation and morphology. The performance of these polymers is less sensitive to their molecular weights compared with PM7. Thus, multiple cases of highly efficient nonfullerene organic solar cells are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance donor polymers is important for nonfullerene organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs), as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptors can only perform well if they are coupled with a matching donor with suitable energy levels. However, there are very limited choices of donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs, and the most commonly used ones are polymers named PM6 and PM7, which suffer from several problems. First, the performance of these polymers (particularly PM7) relies on precise control of their molecular weights. Also, their optimal morphology is extremely sensitive to any structural modification. In this work, a family of donor polymers is developed based on a random polymerization strategy. These polymers can achieve well&#8208;controlled morphology and high&#8208;performance with a variety of chemical structures and molecular weights. The polymer donors are D&#8211;A1&#8211;D&#8211;A2&#8208;type random copolymers in which the D and A1 units are monomers originating from PM6 or PM7, while the A2 unit comprises an electron&#8208;deficient core flanked by two thiophene rings with branched alkyl chains. Consequently, multiple cases of highly efficient NF&#8208;OSCs are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%. As the electron&#8208;deficient cores can be changed to many other structural units, the strategy can easily expand the choices of high&#8208;performance donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs.

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Volumetric Energy Storage by Compressing Nitrogen and Sulfur Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocages via Capillarity</title>
      <dc:description>
Collapsed N,S dual&#8208;doped carbon nanocages are elaborately constructed, integrating high density, large ion&#8208;accessible surface area, and fast charge transfer. The synergism of these characteristics endows the optimized sample with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric performance in both aqueous and ionic&#8208;liquid electrolytes, especially the top&#8208;level stack&#8208;volumetric energy density of 75.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in the ionic liquid.








Abstract
High volumetric performance is a challenging issue for carbon&#8208;based electrical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). Herein, collapsed N,S dual&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (cNS&#8208;CNC) are constructed by simple capillary compression, which eliminates the surplus meso&#8208; and macropores, leading to a much increased density only at the slight expense of specific surface area. The N,S dual&#8208;doping induces strong polarity of the carbon surface, and thus much improves the wettability and charge transfer. The synergism of the high density, large ion&#8208;accessible surface area, and fast charge transfer leads to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric performance under the premise of high rate capability. At a current density of 50 A g&#8722;1, the optimized cNS&#8208;CNC delivers a high volumetric capacitance of 243 and 199 F cm&#8722;3 in KOH and EMIMBF4 electrolyte, with high energy density of 7.9 and 93.4&#160;Wh L&#8722;1, respectively. A top&#8208;level stack volumetric energy density of 75.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 (at power density of 0.7&#160;kW L&#8722;1) and a maximal stack volumetric power density of 112&#160;kW L&#8722;1 (at energy density of 18.8&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) are achieved in EMIMBF4, comparable to the lead&#8211;acid battery in energy density but better in power density with 2&#8211;3 orders. This study demonstrates an efficient strategy to design carbon&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;performance EDLCs with wide practical applications.

      <title>Moisture&#8208;Enabled Electricity Generation: From Physics and Materials to Self&#8208;Powered Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Moisture exists everywhere on Earth and it contains a tremendous amount of energy that remains unexploited. The recent progress in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation in terms of the physics, materials, structures, and potential self&#8208;powered applications in healthcare, security, information storage, and artificial intelligence is explored.








Abstract
The exploration of the utilization of sustainable, green energy represents one way in which it is possible to ameliorate the growing threat of the global environmental issues and the crisis in energy. Moisture, which is ubiquitous on Earth, contains a vast reservoir of low&#8208;grade energy in the form of gaseous water molecules and water droplets. It has now been found that a number of functionalized materials can generate electricity directly from their interaction with moisture. This suggests that electrical energy can be harvested from atmospheric moisture and enables the creation of a new range of self&#8208;powered devices. Herein, the basic mechanisms of moisture&#8208;induced electricity generation are discussed, the recent advances in materials (including carbon nanoparticles, graphene materials, metal oxide nanomaterials, biofibers, and polymers) for harvesting electrical energy from moisture are summarized, and some strategies for improving energy conversion efficiency and output power in these devices are provided. The potential applications of moisture electrical generators in self&#8208;powered electronics, healthcare, security, information storage, artificial intelligence, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things are also discussed. Some remaining challenges are also considered, together with a number of suggestions for potential new developments of this emerging technology.

      <title>Defect Control for 12.5% Efficiency Cu2ZnSnSe4 Kesterite Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells by Engineering of Local Chemical Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin film solar cells with independently confirmed 12.5% total area efficiency have been demonstrated with a novel strategy to effectively control the formation of intrinsic defects and defect clusters in CZTSe by carefully engineering the local chemical environment (e.g., suitable local chemical composition, oxidation states of cations) during film growth.








Abstract
Kesterite&#8208;based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 semiconductors are emerging as promising materials for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;benign, and high&#8208;efficiency thin&#8208;film photovoltaics. However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 devices suffer from cation&#8208;disordering defects and defect clusters, which generally result in severe potential fluctuation, low minority carrier lifetime, and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. Herein, critical growth conditions are reported for obtaining high&#8208;quality Cu2ZnSnSe4 absorber layers with the formation of detrimental intrinsic defects largely suppressed. By controlling the oxidation states of cations and modifying the local chemical composition, the local chemical environment is essentially modified during the synthesis of kesterite phase, thereby effectively suppressing detrimental intrinsic defects and activating desirable shallow acceptor Cu vacancies. Consequently, a confirmed 12.5% efficiency is demonstrated with a high VOC of 491&#160;mV, which is the new record efficiency of pure&#8208;selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 cells with lowest VOC deficit in the kesterite family by Eg/q&#8208;Voc. These encouraging results demonstrate an essential route to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of defect control in kesterite semiconductors, which may also be generally applicable to other multinary compound semiconductors.

     alt="Defect Control for 12.5% Efficiency Cu2ZnSnSe4 Kesterite Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells by Engineering of Local Chemical Environment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kesterite Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CZTSe) thin film solar cells with independently confirmed 12.5% total area efficiency have been demonstrated with a novel strategy to effectively control the formation of intrinsic defects and defect clusters in CZTSe by carefully engineering the local chemical environment (e.g., suitable local chemical composition, oxidation states of cations) during film growth.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kesterite&#8208;based Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductors are emerging as promising materials for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;benign, and high&#8208;efficiency thin&#8208;film photovoltaics. However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; devices suffer from cation&#8208;disordering defects and defect clusters, which generally result in severe potential fluctuation, low minority carrier lifetime, and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. Herein, critical growth conditions are reported for obtaining high&#8208;quality Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; absorber layers with the formation of detrimental intrinsic defects largely suppressed. By controlling the oxidation states of cations and modifying the local chemical composition, the local chemical environment is essentially modified during the synthesis of kesterite phase, thereby effectively suppressing detrimental intrinsic defects and activating desirable shallow acceptor Cu vacancies. Consequently, a confirmed 12.5% efficiency is demonstrated with a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 491&#160;mV, which is the new record efficiency of pure&#8208;selenide Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cells with lowest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit in the kesterite family by &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;oc. These encouraging results demonstrate an essential route to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of defect control in kesterite semiconductors, which may also be generally applicable to other multinary compound semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New High Donor Electrolyte for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a promising high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. DMI, in which polysulfides are highly soluble, allows cell operation under lean electrolyte conditions and diversifies reaction routes involving the sulfur radical. The addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the interface with the Li metal anode, achieving superior cyclability under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
The unparalleled theoretical specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries has attracted considerable research interest from within the battery community. However, most of the long cycling results attained thus far relies on using a large amount of electrolyte in the cell, which adversely affects the specific energy of Li&#8211;S batteries. This shortcoming originates from the low solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Here, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a new high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. The high solubility of polysulfides in DMI and its activation of a new reaction route, which engages the sulfur radical (S3&#8226;&#8722;), enables the efficient utilization of sulfur as reflected in the specific capacity of 1595&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. Moreover, the addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the lithium metal interface, thereby elevating the cycling performance to one of the highest known for high donor electrolytes in Li&#8211;S cells. These engineered high donor electrolytes are expected to advance Li&#8211;S batteries to cover a wide range of practical applications, particularly by incorporating established strategies to realize the reversibility of lithium metal electrodes.

      <title>Topotactically Transformed Polygonal Mesopores on Ternary Layered Double Hydroxides Exposing Under&#8208;Coordinated Metal Centers for Accelerated Water Dissociation</title>
      <dc:description>
A unique metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;mediated topotactic transformation strategy is deployed to fabricate holey ternary layered double hydroxides, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The under&#8208;coordinated metal centers and Fe&#8208;modulated electronic states synergistically promote the kinetics of water dissociation in hydrogen evolution reaction, ultimately leading to superb overall water splitting performance.








Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been recognized as potent electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but are lacking in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities due to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation in alkaline medium. Herein, aiming to simultaneously bolster the HER and OER kinetics, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) mediated topotactic transformation tactic is deployed to fabricate holey ternary CoFeNi LDHs on nickel foam, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The optimized catalyst requires only an external voltage of 1.49&#160;V to afford the water splitting current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 apart from the superb electrolytic stability, far surpassing the benchmark Pt/C||RuO2 couple. More importantly, mechanistic investigations utilizing advanced spectroscopies in conjunction with density function theory (DFT) understandings unravel while the synergetic effect among under&#8208;coordinated metal centers lowers the energy barrier of water dissociation, Fe&#8208;doping enables further modulating the d&#8208;band density of states (DOS) of Co and Ni in favor of intermediates binding, thereby promoting the intrinsic HER activity. Operando Raman studies reveal negligible structural change of the LDHs during the HER process, whereas for OER the active sites can quickly turn into oxyhydroxides in the presence of lattice defects and under&#8208;coordinated metal centers.

Abstract
Blood purification by adsorption of excessive biomolecules is vital for maintaining human health. Here, inspired by kidney self&#8208;purification, which removes a number of biomolecules with different sizes simultaneously, hierarchical molecular&#8208;imprinted inverse opal particles integrated with a herringbone microfluidic chip for efficient biomolecules cleaning are presented. The particle possesses combinative porous structure with both surface and interior imprints for the specific recognition of small molecules and biomacromolecules. Additionally, the presence of the herringbone mixer largely improve the adsorption efficiency due to enhanced mixing. Moreover, the inverse opal framework of the particles give rise to optical sensing ability for self&#8208;reporting of the adsorption states. These features, together with its reusability, biosafety, and biocompatibility, make the platform highly promising for clinical blood purification and artificial kidney construction.

      <dc:description>
A hydrogel with topology&#8208;controlled hydration behavior is designed to tune the water evaporation behavior for highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. The polystyrene sulfonate network generates activated water through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The polyvinyl alcohol network restricts saturated water content for energy concentration. An evaporation rate of &#8776;3.9&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under one&#8208;sun irradiation is achieved.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation provides a promising method for sustainable freshwater production. However, high energy consumption of vapor generation fundamentally restricts practicality of solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. Here a facile strategy is reported to control the hydration of polymer network in hydrogels, where densely cross&#8208;linked polymers serving as a framework are functionalized by a highly hydratable polymeric network. The hydration of polymer chains generates a large amount of weakly bounded water molecules, facilitating the water evaporation. As a result, the hydrogel&#8208;based solar evaporator can extract water from a variety of contaminants such as salts, detergents, and heavy metal components using solar energy with long&#8208;term durability and stability. This work demonstrates an effective way to tune the interaction between water and materials at a molecular level, as well as an energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology toward wastewater containing complex contaminants.

In addition to single nanoparticle patterning, further experiments demonstrate that this technique is also capable of building complex nanostructures, such as nanoparticle clusters with well&#8208;defined shapes and heterogeneously integrated nanostructures consisting of quantum dots and silver nanowires. It opens the door to many important applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Superhydrophobic Droplet&#8208;Based Magnetoelectric Hybrid System to Generate Electricity and Collect Water Simultaneously</title>
      <dc:description>
The fabrication of a miniature, flexible, and superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric system (SDMS) capable of generating electricity is demonstrated. Furthermore, the SDMS is incorporated with a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic pattern, allowing simultaneous electricity generation and water collection from fog. It is believed that the magnetoelectric strategy can enhance and extend functions in a range of energy&#8208;harvesting fields.








Abstract
Traditional electromagnetic generators used in hydraulic power generation are heavy, bulky, and immovable, and are thus unsuitable for low water supply. A portable miniature electromagnetic system that can harvest energy from rainwater is critical for developing a sustainable energy strategy. In this study, a superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric hybrid system is fabricated, that can generate electricity from tiny water droplets. The magnetoelectric system (MS) comprises three parts: a superhydrophobic surface containing a conductive coil, liquid droplets, and a superhydrophobic magnetic powders/Ecoflex base. The mechanical impact of a falling water droplet onto the assembled system is transformed into electricity. Maxwell numerical simulation is used to analyze the related mechanism; the magnetoelectric performance is further improved by modifying the process parameters such as droplet falling velocity and magnetic powder contents. Furthermore, a model is developed, comprising the MS and a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic patterned plate that can generate electricity and collect water from fog, simultaneously. The described magnetoelectric strategy is believed to enhance and extend functions in energy harvesting and provide a generalized method to exploit new systems toward sustainable energy development.

      <title>Weakly Humidity&#8208;Dependent Proton&#8208;Conducting COF Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up approach based on the diffusion and solvent co&#8208;mediated growth of covalent organic frameworks is proposed to synthesize nanosheets of a highly crystalline, intrinsically proton&#8208;conducting COF (IPC&#8208;COF) in aqueous solution. The high&#8208;quality IPC&#8208;COF nanosheets allow the fabrication of defect&#8208;free and robust IPC&#8208;COF membranes that exhibit a weakly humidity&#8208;dependent proton conduction and a prominent fuel cell performance.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton exchange membranes (PEMs) often suffer from significantly reduced conductivity under low relative humidity, hampering their efficient application in fuel cells. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with pre&#8208;designable and well&#8208;defined structures hold promise to cope with the above challenge. However, fabricating defect&#8208;free, robust COF membranes proves an extremely difficult task due to the poor processability of COF materials. Herein, a bottom&#8208;up approach is developed to synthesize intrinsic proton&#8208;conducting COF (IPC&#8208;COF) nanosheets (NUS&#8208;9) in aqueous solutions via diffusion and solvent co&#8208;mediated modulation, enabling a controlled nucleation and in&#8208;plane&#8208;dominated IPC&#8208;COF growth. These nanosheets allow the facile fabrication of IPC&#8208;COF membranes. IPC&#8208;COF membranes with crystalline, rigid ion nanochannels exhibit a weakly humidity&#8208;dependent conductivity over a wide range of humidity (30&#8211;98%), 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of benchmark PEMs, and a prominent fuel cell performance of 0.93&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 35% RH and 80&#160;&#176;C arising from superior water retention and Grotthuss mechanism&#8208;dominated proton conduction.

      <title>A Single&#8208;Mode, Self&#8208;Adapting, and Self&#8208;Powered Mechanoreceptor Based on a Potentiometric&#8211;Triboelectric Hybridized Sensing Mechanism for Resolving Complex Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>
A new potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanotransduction mechanism is proposed to create single&#8208;mode, self&#8208;adapting, and self&#8208;powered artificial mechanoreceptors. Such mechanoreceptors enable complex mechanical stimuli to be resolved with greatly simplified fabrication/operation and enhanced functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency. The promising applications of the mechanoreceptors in monitoring object manipulation and detecting complex stimuli in diverse practical scenarios of daily life is explored.








Abstract
Human skin is equipped with slow adapting (SA) and fast adapting (FA) capabilities simultaneously. To mimic such functionalities, elaborately designed devices have been explored by integrating multiple sensing elements or adopting multimode sensing principles. However, the complicated fabrication, signal mismatch of different modules, complex operation, and high power&#8208;consumption hinder their widespread applications. Here, a new type of single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor that can mimic both SA and FA via seamless fusion of complementary while compatible potentiometric and triboelectric sensing principles is reported. The resultant potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanoreceptor exhibits distinctive features that are hard to achieve via currently existing methods, including single&#8208;mode output (only voltage signal), greatly simplified operation (single&#8208;measurement setup), ultralow power&#8208;consumption (&lt;1 nW), self&#8208;adaptive response behavior, and good capability for resolving complex stimuli. Diverse mechanical characteristics, including magnitude, duration, frequency, applying and releasing speed, can be well interpreted with this single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor. Its promising application for monitoring object manipulations with a soft robotic gripper is explored. Furthermore, the versatility of the mechanoreceptor for resolving complex stimuli in diverse daily scenarios is demonstrated. This work presents a new design that will significantly simplify the fabrication/operation and meanwhile boost the functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency of future electronic devices and smart systems.

      <title>3D Printing of a V8C7&#8211;VO2 Bifunctional Scaffold as an Effective Polysulfide Immobilizer and Lithium Stabilizer for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; 3D&#8208;printing strategy for customizing bifunctional V8C7&#8211;VO2 scaffolds simultaneously realizes effective polysulfide immobilization and lithium stabilization targeting advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have heretofore attracted tremendous interest due to low cost and high energy density. In this realm, both the severe shuttling of polysulfide and the uncontrollable growth of dendritic lithium have greatly hindered their commercial viability. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of rational approaches to simultaneously regulate polysulfide behaviors and restrain lithium dendritic growth. Nevertheless, the major obstacles for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries still lie in little knowledge of bifunctional material candidates and inadequate explorations of advanced technologies for customizable devices. Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is put forward to elaborate V8C7&#8211;VO2 heterostructure scaffolds via the 3D printing (3DP) technique as dual&#8208;effective polysulfide immobilizer and lithium dendrite inhibitor for Li&#8211;S batteries. A thus&#8208;derived 3DP&#8208;V8C7&#8211;VO2/S electrode demostrates excellent rate capability (643.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6.0 C) and favorable cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle at 4.0 C after 900 cycles). Importantly, the integrated Li&#8211;S battery harnessing both 3DP hosts realizes high areal capacity under high sulfur loadings (7.36 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 9.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This work offers insight into solving the concurrent challenges for both S cathode and Li anode throughout 3DP.

      <title>Cooperative Catalysis toward Oxygen Reduction Reaction under Dual Coordination Environments on Intrinsic AMnO3&#8208;Type Perovskites via Regulating Stacking Configurations of Coordination Units</title>
      <dc:description>
The intrinsic superior oxygen reduction reaction activity of SrMnO3 stems from mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking configurations, introducing cooperative catalysis under Mn&#63743;Ocorner and Mn&#63743;Oface coordination environments. The filling of the Ovacancy in the Ocorner site influences the charge distribution in Oface, which modifies the surface interaction strength with intermediates and triggers active site migration from atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#63743;Mn bridge (*O, *OH).








Abstract
It remains challenging for pure&#8208;phase catalysts to achieve high performance during the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction to overcome the sluggish kinetics without the assistance of extrinsic conditions. Herein, a series of pristine perovskites, i.e., AMnO3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba), are proposed with various octahedron stacking configurations to demonstrate the cooperative catalysis over SrMnO3 jointly explored by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Comparing with the unitary stacking of coordination units in CaMnO3 or BaMnO3, the intrinsic SrMnO3 with a mixture of corner&#8208;sharing and face&#8208;sharing octahedron stacking configurations demonstrates superior activity (Ehalf&#8208;wave&#160;= 0.81 V), and charge&#8211;discharge stability over 400 h without the voltage gap (&#8776;0.8 V) increasing in zinc&#8211;air batteries. The theoretical study reveals that, on the SrMnO3(110) surface, the active sites switch from coordinatively unsaturated atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#8211;Mn bridge (*O, *OH). Therefore, the intrinsic dual coordination environments of Mn&#8211;Ocorner and Mn&#8211;Oface enable cooperative modulation of the interaction strength of the oxygen intermediates with the surface, inducing the decrease of the *OH desorption energy (rate&#8208;limiting step) unrestricted by scaling relationships with the overpotential of &#8776;0.28 V. This finding provides insights into catalyst design through screening intrinsic structures with multiple coordination unit stacking configurations.

&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic superior oxygen reduction reaction activity of SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stems from mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking configurations, introducing cooperative catalysis under Mn&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;corner&lt;/sub&gt; and Mn&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;face&lt;/sub&gt; coordination environments. The filling of the O&lt;sub&gt;vacancy&lt;/sub&gt; in the O&lt;sub&gt;corner&lt;/sub&gt; site influences the charge distribution in O&lt;sub&gt;face&lt;/sub&gt;, which modifies the surface interaction strength with intermediates and triggers active site migration from atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Mn bridge (*O, *OH).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains challenging for pure&#8208;phase catalysts to achieve high performance during the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction to overcome the sluggish kinetics without the assistance of extrinsic conditions. Herein, a series of pristine perovskites, i.e., AMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba), are proposed with various octahedron stacking configurations to demonstrate the cooperative catalysis over SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; jointly explored by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Comparing with the unitary stacking of coordination units in CaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or BaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the intrinsic SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a mixture of corner&#8208;sharing and face&#8208;sharing octahedron stacking configurations demonstrates superior activity (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;half&#8208;wave&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 0.81 V), and charge&#8211;discharge stability over 400 h without the voltage gap (&#8776;0.8 V) increasing in zinc&#8211;air batteries. The theoretical study reveals that, on the SrMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(110) surface, the active sites switch from coordinatively unsaturated atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#8211;Mn bridge (*O, *OH). Therefore, the intrinsic dual coordination environments of Mn&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;corner&lt;/sub&gt; and Mn&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;face&lt;/sub&gt; enable cooperative modulation of the interaction strength of the oxygen intermediates with the surface, inducing the decrease of the *OH desorption energy (rate&#8208;limiting step) unrestricted by scaling relationships with the overpotential of &#8776;0.28 V. This finding provides insights into catalyst design through screening intrinsic structures with multiple coordination unit stacking configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibacterial Action of Nanoparticles by Lethal Stretching of Bacterial Cell Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of antimicrobial action for nanoparticles that are unable to translocate across the bacterial cell wall remains obscure. In this work, it is demonstrated that the increase of membrane tension provoked by the adsorption of nanoparticles is responsible for mechanical deformation of the membrane, which leads to bacterial cell rupture and death.








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that nanoparticles (NPs) can kill bacteria; however, the mechanism of antimicrobial action remains obscure for large NPs that cannot translocate the bacterial cell wall. It is demonstrated that the increase in membrane tension caused by the adsorption of NPs is responsible for mechanical deformation, leading to cell rupture and death. A biophysical model of the NP&#8211;membrane interactions is presented which suggests that adsorbed NPs cause membrane stretching and squeezing. This general phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally using both model membranes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, representing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic quasi&#8208;spherical and star&#8208;shaped gold (Au)NPs are synthesized to explore the antibacterial mechanism of non&#8208;translocating AuNPs. Direct observation of nanoparticle&#8208;induced membrane tension and squeezing is demonstrated using a custom&#8208;designed microfluidic device, which relieves contraction of the model membrane surface area and eventual lipid bilayer collapse. Quasi&#8208;spherical nanoparticles exhibit a greater bactericidal action due to a higher interactive affinity, resulting in greater membrane stretching and rupturing, corroborating the theoretical model. Electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the NP&#8211;bacterial&#8208;membrane interactions. This combination of experimental and theoretical results confirm the proposed mechanism of membrane&#8208;tension&#8208;induced (mechanical) killing of bacterial cells by non&#8208;translocating NPs.

      <title>Choose Your Own Adventure: Fabrication of Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
The fabrication challenges of monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem photovoltaics are detailed in a step&#8208;by&#8208;step, choose your own adventure fashion. The trade&#8208;offs between sub&#8208;cell efficiency and processing stability are highlighted and pros and cons are weighed. Through this detailed analysis, a few routes to reach &gt;30%&#160;power conversion efficiency and the necessary work are identified.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have transfixed the photovoltaic (PV) community due to their outstanding and tunable optoelectronic properties coupled to demonstrations of high&#8208;power conversion efficiencies (PCE) at a range of bandgaps. This has motivated the field to push perovskites to reach the highest possible performance. One way to increase the efficiency is by fabricating multijunction solar cells, which can split the solar spectrum, reducing thermalization loss. Low&#8208;cost all&#8208;perovskite tandems have a real chance to soon exceed 30% PCE, which could transform the PV industry. Achieving this goal requires the identification of perovskite sub&#8208;cells that are both highly efficient and can be effectively integrated. Herein, it is discussed how to navigate the multiple&#8208;choice adventure in choosing between the myriad of options and considerations present when deciding what perovskite materials, contact layers, and processing tools to use. Some of the potential fabrication pitfalls often encountered in MHP based tandem PVs are highlighted, so that they can hopefully be avoided in the future.

      <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Mechanically Tough Polyurethane Elastomers with Exceptional Damage Tolerance</title>
      <dc:description>
Healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough elastomers with exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking polyurethanes with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed dynamic hierarchical domains capable of deformation and disintegration under external force. Elastomers can be healed and recycled in a highly efficient way to restore their original mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a huge requirement of elastomers for use in tires, seals, and shock absorbers every year worldwide. In view of a sustainable society, the next generation of elastomers is expected to combine outstanding healing, recycling, and damage&#8208;tolerant capacities with high strength, elasticity, and toughness. However, it remains challenging to fabricate such elastomers because the mechanisms for the properties mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Herein, the fabrication of healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough polyurethane (PU) elastomers with outstanding damage tolerance by coordination of multiblock polymers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/polycaprolactone (PCL) containing hydrogen and coordination bonding motifs with Zn2+ ions is reported. The organization of bipyridine groups coordinated with Zn2+ ions, carbamate groups cross&#8208;linked with hydrogen bonds, and crystallized PCL segments generates phase&#8208;separated dynamic hierarchical domains. Serving as rigid nanofillers capable of deformation and disintegration under an external force, the dynamic hierarchical domains can strengthen the elastomers and significantly enhance their toughness and fracture energy. As a result, the elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of &#8776;52.4&#160;MPa, a toughness of &#8776;363.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and an exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, the elastomers can be conveniently healed and recycled to regain their original mechanical properties and integrity under heating.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Construction of Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Imaging Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphorescence resonance energy transfer is introduced to transfer the short&#8208;wavelength emission of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence luminogens to near&#8208;infrared fluorescent luminogens for realization of near&#8208;infrared afterglow in vivo imaging. The doped nanoparticles of mTPA&#8208;N are applied for subcutaneous and lymph&#8208;node imaging in living mice with extremely low background noise and deep tissue penetration.








Abstract
Afterglow imaging that detects photons after cessation of optical excitation avoids tissue autofluorescence and thus possesses higher sensitivity than traditional fluorescence imaging. Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have emerged as a new library of benign afterglow agents. However, most RTP luminogens only emit visible light with shallow tissue penetration, constraining their in vivo applications. This study presents an organic RTP nanoprobe (mTPA&#8208;N) with emission in the NIR range for in vivo afterglow imaging. Such a probe is composed of RTP molecule (mTPA) as the phosphorescent generator and an NIR&#8208;fluorescent dye as the energy acceptor to enable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (RT&#8208;PRET), ultimately resulting in redshifted phosphorescent emission at 780&#160;nm. Because of the elimination of background noise and redshifted afterglow luminescence in a biologically transparent window, mTPA&#8208;N permits imaging of lymph nodes in living mice with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This study thus opens up a universal approach to develop organic RTP luminogens into NIR afterglow imaging agents via construction of RT&#8208;PRET.

      <title>Tissue&#8208;Adaptive Materials with Independently Regulated Modulus and Transition Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Bottlebrush elastomers with crystallizable side chains undergo dramatic softening transition upon heating. At body temperature &#8776;37 &#176;C,&#160;these materials drop their modulus by up to six orders of magnitude transitioning from hard plastic to tissue&#8208;like elastomer with transition temperature and modulus controlled by brush architecture. Simultaneously, materials softening triggers drug release, thus highlighting their potential as tissue&#8208;adaptive implants.








Abstract
The ability of living species to transition between rigid and flexible shapes represents one of their survival mechanisms, which has been adopted by various human technologies. Such transition is especially desired in medical devices as rigidity facilitates the implantation process, while flexibility and softness favor biocompatibility with surrounding tissue. Traditional thermoplastics cannot match soft tissue mechanics, while gels leach into the body and alter their properties over time. Here, a single&#8208;component system with an unprecedented drop of Young's modulus by up to six orders of magnitude from the GPa to kPa level at a controlled temperature within 28&#8211;43&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated. This approach is based on brush&#8208;like polymer networks with crystallizable side chains, e.g., poly(valerolactone), affording independent control of melting temperature and Young's modulus by concurrently altering side chain length and crosslink density. Softening down to the tissue level at the physiological temperature allows the design of tissue&#8208;adaptive implants that can be inserted as rigid devices followed by matching the surrounding tissue mechanics at body temperature. This transition also enables thermally triggered release of embedded drugs for anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment.

     alt="Tissue&#8208;Adaptive Materials with Independently Regulated Modulus and Transition Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottlebrush elastomers with crystallizable side chains undergo dramatic softening transition upon heating. At body temperature &#8776;37 &#176;C,&#160;these materials drop their modulus by up to six orders of magnitude transitioning from hard plastic to tissue&#8208;like elastomer with transition temperature and modulus controlled by brush architecture. Simultaneously, materials softening triggers drug release, thus highlighting their potential as tissue&#8208;adaptive implants.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of living species to transition between rigid and flexible shapes represents one of their survival mechanisms, which has been adopted by various human technologies. Such transition is especially desired in medical devices as rigidity facilitates the implantation process, while flexibility and softness favor biocompatibility with surrounding tissue. Traditional thermoplastics cannot match soft tissue mechanics, while gels leach into the body and alter their properties over time. Here, a single&#8208;component system with an unprecedented drop of Young's modulus by up to six orders of magnitude from the GPa to kPa level at a controlled temperature within 28&#8211;43&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C is demonstrated. This approach is based on brush&#8208;like polymer networks with crystallizable side chains, e.g., poly(valerolactone), affording independent control of melting temperature and Young's modulus by concurrently altering side chain length and crosslink density. Softening down to the tissue level at the physiological temperature allows the design of tissue&#8208;adaptive implants that can be inserted as rigid devices followed by matching the surrounding tissue mechanics at body temperature. This transition also enables thermally triggered release of embedded drugs for anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Insulator Transition and Orbital Polarization in Nickelate Superlattices Integrated on Silicon</title>
      <dc:description>
Strain engineering is well demonstrated for perovskite oxides, mostly by growing epitaxial films onto an isostructural oxide substrate having different lattice constant. The joint effects of epitaxial and thermal strain on the metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and orbital configuration are revealed for nickelate superlattices grown on silicon substrates, illustrating the feasibility of extending strain engineering to the technologically important silicon platform.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 (STO) on silicon greatly accelerates the monolithic integration of multifunctional oxides into the mainstream semiconductor electronics. However, oxide superlattices (SLs), the birthplace of many exciting discoveries, remain largely unexplored on silicon. In this work, LaNiO3/LaFeO3 SLs are synthesized on STO&#8208;buffered silicon (Si/STO) and STO single&#8208;crystal substrates, and their electronic properties are compared using dc transport and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Both sets of SLs show a similar thickness&#8208;driven metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, albeit with resistivity and transition temperature modified by the different amounts of strain. In particular, the large tensile strain promotes a pronounced Ni 3dx2&#8722;y2 orbital polarization for the SL grown on Si/STO, comparable to that reported for LaNiO3 SL epitaxially strained to DyScO3 substrate. Those results illustrate the ability to integrate oxide SLs on silicon with structure and property approaching their counterparts grown on STO single crystal, and also open up new prospects of strain engineering in functional oxides based on the Si platform.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of 2D Janus Crystals and their Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories predict that this broken symmetry leads to a wealth of novel properties. A room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers and their lateral and vertical heterostructures with high structural and optical quality is reported.








Abstract
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories have predicted that this symmetry breaking induces an electric field and leads to a wealth of novel properties, such as large Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and formation of strongly correlated electronic states. Monolayer MoSSe Janus crystals have been synthesized by two methods, via controlled sulfurization of monolayer MoSe2 and via plasma stripping followed thermal annealing of MoS2. However, the high processing temperatures prevent growth of other Janus materials and their heterostructures. Here, a room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers with high structural and optical quality is reported. This process involves low&#8208;energy reactive radical precursors, which enables selective removal and replacement of the uppermost chalcogen layer, thus transforming classical transition metal dichalcogenides into a Janus structure. The resulting materials show clear mixed character for their excitonic transitions, and more importantly, the presented room&#8208;temperature method enables the demonstration of first vertical and lateral heterojunctions of 2D Janus TMDs. The results present significant and pioneering advances in the synthesis of new classes of 2D materials, and pave the way for the creation of heterostructures from 2D Janus layers.

      <title>Blood&#8208;Derived Biomaterial for Catheter&#8208;Directed Arterial Embolization</title>
      <dc:description>
Blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is engineered for catheter&#8208;directed arterial embolization. This embolic biomaterial shows remarkable modulus, radiopacity, retrievability, and bioactivity, capable of achieving durable embolization in porcine iliac and renal arteries. The blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is a simple and affordable embolic biomaterial that can be prepared at the point of care for emergency embolization procedures including the treatment of bleeding arteries.








Abstract
Vascular embolization is a life&#8208;saving minimally invasive catheter&#8208;based procedure performed to treat bleeding vessels. Through these catheters, numerous metallic coils are often pushed into the bleeding artery to stop the blood flow. While there are numerous drawbacks to coil embolization, physician expertise, availability of these coils, and their costs further limit their use. Here, a novel blood&#8208;derived embolic material (BEM) with regenerative properties, that can achieve instant and durable intra&#8208;arterial hemostasis regardless of coagulopathy, is developed. In a large animal model of vascular embolization, it is shown that the BEM can be prepared at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care within 26 min using fresh blood, it can be easily delivered using clinical catheters to embolize renal and iliac arteries, and it can achieve rapid hemostasis in acutely injured vessels. In swine arteries, the BEM increases cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue deposition, suggesting vessel healing and durable vessel occlusion. The BEM has significant advantages over embolic materials used today, making it a promising new tool for embolization.

Abstract
There is an increasing interest to develop a next generation of touch pads that require stretchability and biocompatibility to allow their integration with a human body, and even to mimic the self&#8208;healing behavior with fast functionality recovery upon damage. However, most touch pads are developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes with the lack of the important nature of self&#8208;healing. Polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels as a soft, stretchable, and transparent ionic conductor with transmittance of 98.8% and fracture strain beyond 1500% are developed, which can be used as a self&#8208;healing human&#8211;machine interactive touch pad with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates. A surface&#8208;capacitive touch system is adopted to sense a touched position. Finger positions are perceived during both point&#8208;by&#8208;point touch and continuous moving. Hydrogel touch pads are adhered to curved or flat insulators, with the high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and playing electronic games.

      <title>A Surface Se&#8208;Substituted LiCo[O2&#8722;&#948;Se&#948;] Cathode with Ultrastable High&#8208;Voltage Cycling in Pouch Full&#8208;Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Selenium has an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect when charging commercial LiCoO2 to high voltages, by substituting part of the mobile oxidized oxygen ions (O&#945;&#8208;) in the charged lattice to eliminate oxygen vacancies, transplant the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8208;, and reduce the mobile O&#945;&#8208; ions back to immobile O2&#8208; ions, to stop further oxygen migration and stabilize the high&#8208;voltage cycling.








Abstract
Cycling LiCoO2 to above 4.5&#160;V for higher capacity is enticing; however, hybrid O anion&#8208; and Co cation&#8208;redox (HACR) at high voltages facilitates intrinsic O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&#160;&lt; 2) migration, causing oxygen loss, phase collapse, and electrolyte decomposition that severely degrade the battery cyclability. Hereby, commercial LiCoO2 particles are operando treated with selenium, a well&#8208;known anti&#8208;aging element to capture oxygen&#8208;radicals in the human body, showing an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect in high&#8208;voltage battery cycling and successfully stopping the escape of oxygen from LiCoO2 even when the cathode is cycled to 4.62 V. Ab initio calculation and soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis suggest that during deep charging, the precoated Se will initially substitute some mobile O&#945;&#8722; at the charged LiCoO2 surface, transplanting the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8722; and reducing it back to O2&#8722; to stabilize the oxygen lattice in prolonged cycling. As a result, the material retains 80% and 77% of its capacity after 450 and 550 cycles under 100 mA g&#8722;1 in 4.57&#160;V pouch full&#8208;cells matched with a graphite anode and an ultralean electrolyte (2&#160;g Ah&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;Selenium has an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect when charging commercial LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to high voltages, by substituting part of the mobile oxidized oxygen ions (O&lt;sup&gt;&#945;&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the charged lattice to eliminate oxygen vacancies, transplant the pumped charges from O&lt;sup&gt;&#945;&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt;, and reduce the mobile O&lt;sup&gt;&#945;&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; ions back to immobile O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; ions, to stop further oxygen migration and stabilize the high&#8208;voltage cycling.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to above 4.5&#160;V for higher capacity is enticing; however, hybrid O anion&#8208; and Co cation&#8208;redox (HACR) at high voltages facilitates intrinsic O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#945;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&#945;&#160;&amp;lt; 2) migration, causing oxygen loss, phase collapse, and electrolyte decomposition that severely degrade the battery cyclability. Hereby, commercial LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles are operando treated with selenium, a well&#8208;known anti&#8208;aging element to capture oxygen&#8208;radicals in the human body, showing an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect in high&#8208;voltage battery cycling and successfully stopping the escape of oxygen from LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; even when the cathode is cycled to 4.62 V. Ab initio calculation and soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis suggest that during deep charging, the precoated Se will initially substitute some mobile O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#945;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; at the charged LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, transplanting the pumped charges from O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#945;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reducing it back to O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to stabilize the oxygen lattice in prolonged cycling. As a result, the material retains 80% and 77% of its capacity after 450 and 550 cycles under 100 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 4.57&#160;V pouch full&#8208;cells matched with a graphite anode and an ultralean electrolyte (2&#160;g Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Like Ultrahigh Free&#8208;Carrier Concentration in Metal&#8208;Oxide Material for Giant and Tunable Plasmon Resonance</title>
      <dc:description>
The giant and tunable plasmonic material of HxMoO3 holds a high free&#8208;carrier concentration up to 1021 cm&#8722;3, approaching that of metals. The unique quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure provides a long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra with an enhancement factor of 1.1 &#215; 107 and a detection limit of 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1 are achieved, representing the best among the hitherto reported metal oxides.








Abstract
The practical utilization of plasmon&#8208;based technology relies on the ability to find high&#8208;performance plasmonic materials other than noble metals. A key scientific challenge is to significantly increase the intrinsically low concentration of free carriers in metal&#8208;oxide materials. Here, a novel electron&#8211;proton co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to achieve uniform hydrogen doping in metal&#8208;oxide MoO3 at mild conditions, which creates a metal&#8208;like ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration approaching that of noble metals (1021 cm&#8722;3 in H1.68MoO3 versus 1022 cm&#8722;3 in Au/Ag). This bestows giant and tunable plasmonic resonances in the visible region to this originally semiconductive material. Using ultrafast spectroscopy characterizations and first&#8208;principle simulations, the formation of a quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure that leads to long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field is revealed. As verified by the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of rhodamine 6G molecules on HxMoO3, the SERS enhancement factor reaches as high as 1.1 &#215; 107 with a detection limit at concentration as low as 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1, representing the best among the hitherto reported non&#8208;metal systems. The findings not only provide a set of metal&#8208;like semiconductor materials with merits of low cost, tunable electronic structure, and plasmonic resonance, but also a general strategy to induce tunable ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration in non&#8208;metal systems.

      <title>Biomimicking Antibacterial Opto&#8208;Electro Sensing Sutures Made of Regenerated Silk Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
A set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures made of regenerated silk fibroin inspired by natural spider&#8208;silk fibers is presented. These sensing sutures are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized so as to integrate multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions include reducing inflammation, antibacterial activity, tension measurements, aiding tissue healing, and opto&#8208;electro monitoring.








Abstract
Surgical sutures play an important role across a wide range of medical treatments and a wide variety exist, differing in strength, size, composition, and performance. Recently, increasing interest has been paid to bioactive and electronic sutures made of synthetic polymers, owing to their ability to reduce inflammation as well as medically and/or electronically facilitate wound healing. However, integrating sensing capabilities into bioactive sutures without adversely affecting their mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and/or bioactivity remains challenging. In this work, a set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures based on the regenerated silk fibroin is designed and fabricated. These sensing sutures, inspired by the &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; multilayered structure of natural spider&#8208;silk fibers, are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized to allow for the integration of multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions included: reducing inflammation and bacterial infection in wound sites, measuring tension of both the tissue and suture, and aiding tissue healing via multi&#8208;modal controlled drug and growth factor release. Critically, these functions are coupled with real&#8208;time optical and electronic monitoring capabilities. This approach provides greater insight into multifunctional sutures with inherent sensing capabilities and offers enormous potential in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

By using the statistical ensemble behavior of all point defects within the 3D bulk for information storage, they solve the challenge of stochastic switching that has plagued filament&#8208;based memristors.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Metaholographic Displays with Designer Liquid Crystal Modulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based metamaterial devices, which can sense targeted stimuli such as electric&#8208;field, temperature and pressure, and report them optically by displaying corresponding holograms, are demonstrated. The demonstrated systems enable a variety of applications like hologram labels that indicate freshness of temperature&#8208;sensitive products during storage or transport and interactive holographic displays with touch sensing or motion recognition.








Abstract
Flat optics, realized by the artificially created 2D material platform called optical metasurfaces, is currently undergoing a science&#8208;to&#8208;technology transition. However, &#8220;real&#8208;time&#8221; active operations of such flat optical devices remain yet unresolved. Here, liquid crystals (LCs)&#8208;integrated metaholograms for ultracompact dynamic holographic displays are proposed. The anisotropic nature of the LCs allows facile and repeatable manipulation of the polarization of light. Specifically designed (&#8220;designer&#8221;) LCs and efficient helicity&#8208;encoded metaholograms are combined to realize stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic displays. The designer LC modulators are used as switches that enable a variety of external stimuli (e.g., electric field, heat, surface pressure) to operate holographic images in real&#8208;time. Such a dynamic metaholographic platform will provide a path to external stimuli&#8208;driven &#8220;smart&#8221; sensing and display applications such as hologram labels for temperature/pressure/touch monitoring and interactive holographic displays with haptic motion recognition.

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D photoengraving strategy capable of integrating diverse metasurfaces into a single composite monolith is demonstrated.&#160;This&#160;method facilitates micro&#8208;/nanoscale patterning of metasurfaces onto individual facets in a diverse range of 3D scaffolds, in an independent, high&#8208;throughput, and on&#8208;demand fashion.








Abstract
Metasurfaces present a potent platform to manipulate light by the spatial arrangement of sub&#8208;wavelength patterns with well&#8208;defined sizes and geometries, in thin films. Metasurfaces by definition are planar. However, it would be highly desirable to integrate metasurfaces with diverse, spatially programmed sub&#8208;wavelength features into a 3D monolith, to manipulate light within a compact 3D space. Here, a 3D photoengraving strategy is presented; that is, generation of such composite metasurfaces from a single microstructure via the irradiation of multiple interference laser beams onto different facets of the parent azopolymeric microstructure. Through &#8220;photofluidization,&#8221;&#160;this&#160;technique enables independent inscription and erasing of metasurfaces onto and from individual facets of 3D monoliths with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, in a high&#8208;throughput fashion (over approximately a few cm2 at a time). By engraving discrete sub&#8208;wavelength 1D surface relief gratings of different pitches on different facets of an inverse pyramidal array, a multiplexing structure&#8208;color filter is demonstrated.

      <title>Kinetically Stable Oxide Overlayers on Mo3P Nanoparticles Enabling Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries with Low Overpotentials and Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Mo3P nanoparticles with a kinetically stable oxide overlayer exhibit remarkable ORR/OER activities near thermodynamic potentials in non&#8208;aqueous media. Using this catalyst alongside TEMPO and DBBQ redox mediators in a lithium&#8211;air battery favors the solution&#8208;based mechanism for epitaxial growth of Li2O2 at the lowest overpotentials, the effects of which are addressed through directed experimental efforts in electrochemical characterization coupled with a computational approach.








Abstract
The main drawbacks of today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries are their low energy efficiency and limited cycle life due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant cathode catalysts that can drive both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) at high rates at thermodynamic potentials. Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo3P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity&#8212;ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li+, respectively&#8212;in an oxygen&#8208;saturated non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance&#8212;Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec&#8722;1 for ORR and OER, respectively&#8212;resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li&#8211;air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo3P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawbacks of today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries are their low energy efficiency and limited cycle life due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant cathode catalysts that can drive both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) at high rates at thermodynamic potentials. Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity&#8212;ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively&#8212;in an oxygen&#8208;saturated non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance&#8212;Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for ORR and OER, respectively&#8212;resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li&#8211;air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Observation of Supercavity Modes in Subwavelength Dielectric Resonators</title>
      <dc:description>
Excitation of supercavity modes in high&#8208;index subwavelength dielectric resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is demonstrated in near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field measurements. The measured unloaded Q factor of supercavity modes is in the range from 500 to 12&#160;500, limited by absorption losses. A peculiar change of the directivity pattern of supercavity modes and their relation to Fano resonances is shown experimentally.








Abstract
Electromagnetic response of dielectric resonators with high refractive index is governed by optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances facilitating confinement of light with the amplitude enhancement. Traditionally, strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated only with plasmonic or epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero structures, which however suffer from material losses. Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed allowing the trapping of light in individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the regime of a supercavity mode. Here, the experimental observation of the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is presented. It is experimentally demonstrated that the regime of supercavity modes can be achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions. A huge growth of the unloaded quality factor is achieved with experimental values up to 1.25&#160;&#215; 104, limited only by material losses of ceramics. It is revealed that the supercavity modes can be excited efficiently both in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field. In both cases, the supercavity mode manifests itself explicitly as a Fano resonance with characteristic peculiarities of spectral shape and radiation pattern. A comparison of supercavities made of diversified materials for the visible, infrared, THz, and radio&#8208;frequency regimes is provided.

      <title>A Solvent&#8208;Exchange Strategy to Regulate Noncovalent Interactions for Strong and Antiswelling Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of stiff and antiswelling hydrogels (named as exogels). Key to this approach is the rational regulation of noncovalent interactions and thus the conformation of polymers and structure of the cross&#8208;linked networks. Moreover, the unique sol&#8211;gel progression via solvent exchange makes exogels applicable for robust underwater adhesion.








Abstract
Physical hydrogels from existing polymers consisting of noncovalent interacting networks are highly desired due to their well&#8208;controlled compositions and environmental friendliness; and therefore, applied as adhesives, artificial tissues, and soft machines. Nevertheless, these gels have suffered from weak mechanical strength and low water resistance. Current methodologies used to fabricate these hydrogels mainly involve the freezing&#8211;thawing process (cryogels), which are complicated in preparation and short in adjustment of polymer conformation. Here, taking the merits of noncovalent bonds in adjustability and reversibility, a solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of exogels. Based on the exchange from a good solvent subsequently to a poor one, the intra&#8208; and interpolymer interactions are initially suppressed and then recovered, resulting in dissolving and cross&#8208;linking to polymers, respectively. Key to this approach is the good solvent, which favors of a stretched polymer conformation to homogenize the network, forming cross&#8208;linked hydrogel networks with remarkable stiffness, toughness, antiswelling properties, and thus underwater adhesive performance. The exogels highlight a facile but highly effective strategy of turning the solvent and consequently the noncovalent interactions to achieve the rational design of enhanced hydrogels and hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials.

      <dc:description>
Van der Waals epitaxial growth of wafer&#8208;scale mosaic&#8208;like 2D PtTe2 layer is achieved for highly sensitive MIR photodetection. A photodetector based on a PtTe2/Si Schottky junction is capable of sensing ultrabroadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. The photodetector arrays also display an excellent room&#8208;temperature MIR imaging capability.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection, covering diverse molecular vibrational regions and atmospheric transmission windows, is vital to civil and military purposes. Versatile use of MIR photodetectors is commonly dominated by HgCdTe alloys, InSb, and quantum superlattices, which are limited by strict operation demands, high&#8208;cost, and environmental toxicity. Despite the rapid advances of black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based MIR photodetectors, these are subject to poor stability and large&#8208;area integration difficulty. Here, the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxial growth of a wafer&#8208;scale 2D platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) layer is reported via a simple tellurium&#8208;vapor transformation approach. The 2D PtTe2 layer possesses a unique mosaic&#8208;like crystal structure consisting of single&#8208;crystal domains with highly preferential [001] orientation along the normal direction, reducing the influence of interface defects and ensuring efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transportation. This characteristic, combined with the wide absorption of PtTe2 and well&#8208;designed vertical device architecture, makes the PtTe2/Si Schottky junction photodetector capable of sensing ultra&#8208;broadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. Also, the photodetector exhibits an excellent room&#8208;temperature infrared&#8208;imaging capability. This approach provides a new design concept for high&#8208;performance, room&#8208;temperature MIR photodetection based on 2D layered materials.

      <title>Scalable Substitutional Re&#8208;Doping and its Impact on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Tungsten Diselenide</title>
      <dc:description>
Substitutional rhenium (Re) doping of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films is achieved via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at front&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (FEOL) and back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible temperatures, with the doping concentration of &lt;0.001%. Trion concentration is increased as a function of dopant concentration and discrete donor levels are observed that lie close to the conduction band confirming the n&#8208;type dopant nature of the rhenium atoms.








Abstract
Reliable, controlled doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides will enable the realization of next&#8208;generation electronic, logic&#8208;memory, and magnetic devices based on these materials. However, to date, accurate control over dopant concentration and scalability of the process remains a challenge. Here, a systematic study of scalable in situ doping of fully coalesced 2D WSe2 films with Re atoms via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition is reported. Dopant concentrations are uniformly distributed over the substrate surface, with precisely controlled concentrations down to &lt;0.001%&#160;Re achieved by tuning the precursor partial pressure. Moreover, the impact of doping on morphological, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of WSe2 is elucidated with detailed experimental and theoretical examinations, confirming that the substitutional doping of Re at the W site leads to n&#8208;type behavior of WSe2. Transport characteristics of fabricated back&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors are directly correlated to the dopant concentration, with degrading device performances for doping concentrations exceeding 1% of Re. The study demonstrates a viable approach to introducing true dopant&#8208;level impurities with high precision, which can be scaled up to batch production for applications beyond digital electronics.

      <title>Polymeric Membranes with Selective Solution&#8208;Diffusion for Intercepting Volatile Organic Compounds during Solar&#8208;Driven Water Remediation</title>
      <dc:description>
A micropyramid&#8208;structured PPy membrane with selective solution&#8208;diffusion effect is employed as the photothermal material for solar water purification. The membrane is successful in intercepting the evaporation of volatile organic molecules in wastewater. Furthermore, its high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency and good mechanical strength make the membrane a promising photothermal material for practical solar water purification.








Abstract
Solar evaporation through a photothermal porous material provides a feasible and sustainable method for water remediation. Several photothermal materials have been developed to enhance solar evaporation efficiency. However, a critical limitation of current photothermal materials is their inability to separate water from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in wastewater. Here, a microstructured ultrathin polymeric membrane that enables freshwater separation from VOC pollutants by solar evaporation with a VOC removal rate of 90%, is reported. The different solution&#8208;diffusion behaviors of water and VOCs with polymeric membranes facilitate their separation. Moreover, owing to increased light absorption, enlarged liquid&#8211;air interface, and shortened mass transfer distance, the microstructured and ultrathin configuration of the membrane helps to balance the tradeoff between permeation selectivity and water production capacity. The membrane is not only effective for evaporation of simulated volatile pollutants in a prototype, but can also intercept complex volatile organic contaminants in natural water sources and produce water that meets drinking&#8208;water standards. With practical demonstration and satisfactory purification performance, this work paves the way for practical application of solar evaporation for effective water remediation.

     alt="Polymeric Membranes with Selective Solution&#8208;Diffusion for Intercepting Volatile Organic Compounds during Solar&#8208;Driven Water Remediation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A micropyramid&#8208;structured PPy membrane with selective solution&#8208;diffusion effect is employed as the photothermal material for solar water purification. The membrane is successful in intercepting the evaporation of volatile organic molecules in wastewater. Furthermore, its high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency and good mechanical strength make the membrane a promising photothermal material for practical solar water purification.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar evaporation through a photothermal porous material provides a feasible and sustainable method for water remediation. Several photothermal materials have been developed to enhance solar evaporation efficiency. However, a critical limitation of current photothermal materials is their inability to separate water from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in wastewater. Here, a microstructured ultrathin polymeric membrane that enables freshwater separation from VOC pollutants by solar evaporation with a VOC removal rate of 90%, is reported. The different solution&#8208;diffusion behaviors of water and VOCs with polymeric membranes facilitate their separation. Moreover, owing to increased light absorption, enlarged liquid&#8211;air interface, and shortened mass transfer distance, the microstructured and ultrathin configuration of the membrane helps to balance the tradeoff between permeation selectivity and water production capacity. The membrane is not only effective for evaporation of simulated volatile pollutants in a prototype, but can also intercept complex volatile organic contaminants in natural water sources and produce water that meets drinking&#8208;water standards. With practical demonstration and satisfactory purification performance, this work paves the way for practical application of solar evaporation for effective water remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Highly selective and cost&#8208;effective separation of light hydrocarbons is of vital importance for the petrochemical industry. In light of their tunable porosity and functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for the adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons with high similarity. Tailored MOFs with optimal pore size and shape can be achieved for the most efficient separation of light hydrocarbons through molecular sieving, as reviewed by Jing Li and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002603.

      <title>Photocatalysts: Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport (Adv. Mater. 44/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002556, Shouhua Feng, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers give an overview of rational design to elevate the photocatalytic performance of hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) by surface and mass&#8208;transfer optimization. Enlarged effective surface areas and the boosted mass transport in HoMSs greatly favor the energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis. In addition, specific structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance are described, along with proposed guidance for the development directions of HoMS photocatalysts.
