         <title>Precise Engineering of a Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes based on mono&#8208;dentate ligands with high luminance and efficiencies are realized through a non&#8208;doped bilayer structure of [TPP]4Cu4I4|TmPyPB, in which pyridine&#8208;capped TmPyPB effectively passivates surface defects of [TPP]4Cu4I4 layer to prevent interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation, resulting in &#8776;200 and 23 folds increased luminance and external quantum efficiency, respectively.








Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands are realized since their structural instability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is first overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8776;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as &#8776;200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt;20 nits) to highly bright (&gt;3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>Robust Sub&#8208;5 Nanometer bis(Diarylcarbene)&#8208;Based Thin Film for Molecular Electronics and Plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier are accessible, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond and shows promising applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#63743;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of the high&#8208;entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low&#8208;index HEA surfaces.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

&lt;p&gt;The epitaxial growth of the high-entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low-energy electron diffraction and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low-index HEA surfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single-crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well-defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;engineering of nanomaterials has become a hot topic in recent years because of the resulting excellent physical and chemical properties. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be improved by adjusting the type and concentration of defects. An overview about defect engineering in biomedical science is presented with a view to provide researchers with new ideas from the perspective of materials science.








Abstract
With the promotion of nanochemistry research, large numbers of nanomaterials have been applied in vivo to produce desirable cytotoxic substances in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli for achieving disease&#8208;specific therapy. However, the performance of nanomaterials is a critical issue that is difficult to improve and optimize under biological conditions. Defect&#8208;engineered nanoparticles have become the most researched hot materials in biomedical applications recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as optical properties and redox reaction capabilities. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by regulating the type and concentration of defects in the nanoparticles without requiring other complex designs. Therefore, this tutorial review focuses on biomedical defect engineering and briefly discusses defect classification, introduction strategies, and characterization techniques. Several representative defective nanomaterials are especially discussed in order to reveal the relationship between defects and properties. A series of disease treatment strategies based on defective engineered nanomaterials are summarized. By summarizing the design and application of defective engineered nanomaterials, a simple but effective methodology is provided for researchers to design and improve the therapeutic effects of nanomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic platforms from a materials science perspective.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high&#8208;performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustainable development. In this work, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells is prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL to have high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;13&#160;m2), and fuel&#8208;cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various gas&#8208;diffusion backings (GDBs), providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, anode standalone MPLs and GDBs can be easily detached from the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt;90 vol% solvent in the recovery of the catalyst&#8208;coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of the GDBs and the anode standalone MPL at least 138 times (2 760 000&#160;h assuming 20 000&#160;h of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are designed using a photopatternable conjugated polymer with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking. To prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the polymer is irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, and thermally annealed under a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are developed by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal Film on Graphene for Percolation&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Limited Thermal Emissivity Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au atoms tend to form a thin, crystalline layer on graphene surfaces via van der Waals epitaxy, resulting in translucent, conductive films. Translucent yet reflective Au/graphene hybrids are invisible to the naked eye but can be clearly identified at IR wavelength. Au/graphene hybrids can be applied to a wide range of thermal management applications ranging from energy harvesting and storage to military applications.








Abstract
Translucent Au/graphene hybrid films are shown to be effective in reducing thermal emission from the underlying surfaces when the deposition thickness of Au is close to the percolation threshold. The critical Au deposition thickness for an abrupt change in emissivity is reduced from 15&#160;nm (Si substrate) to a percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited thickness of 8.5&#160;nm (graphene/Si substrate) because of the chemical inertness of graphene leading to the deposited Au atoms forming a thin, crystalline layer. The effect of the graphene layer on the optical properties of the hybrid film is highlighted by a drastic increase in infrared absorptivity, whereas the visible absorptivity is marginally affected by the presence of a graphene layer. The level of thermal emission from the Au/graphene hybrid films with the percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited Au thickness is stable even with high background temperatures of up to 300 &#176;C and mechanical strains of &#8776;4%. As an example of a thermal management application, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting device is demonstrated; thermal&#8208;camouflage&#8208;masked text fabricated with an Au/graphene hybrid film is discernible only using a thermographic camera. Ultrathin metal film assisted by a graphene layer will provide a facile platform for thermal management with semi&#8208;transparency, flexibility, and transferability to arbitrary surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;Au atoms tend to form a thin, crystalline layer on graphene surfaces via van der Waals epitaxy, resulting in translucent, conductive films. Translucent yet reflective Au/graphene hybrids are invisible to the naked eye but can be clearly identified at IR wavelength. Au/graphene hybrids can be applied to a wide range of thermal management applications ranging from energy harvesting and storage to military applications.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fe&#8208;Intercalation Dominated Ferromagnetism of van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe intercalation on the interstitial sites in high Curie temperature (Tc) Fe3GeTe2 may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc.








Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. This study explores the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208;Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed to have an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine that Induces Synergistic Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autologous extracellular nanovesicle vaccine derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells directly activates both innate immune cells and AML&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells without having to define tumor antigens. It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.








Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that can directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

         <title>Chiral MOF Derived Wearable Logic Sensor for Intuitive Discrimination of Physiologically Active Enantiomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective wearable membrane sensor with dual colorimetric response to lactate enantiomers is developed. The sensor can intuitively index the exercise intensity via the dual colorimetric changes readable to naked eyes, and a chiral IMPLICATION logic gate can be further achieved for smart sensor design.








Abstract
Chiral sensors have attracted growing interest due to their application in health monitoring. However, rational design of wearable logic chiral sensors remains a great challenge. In this work, a dual responsive chiral sensor RT@CDMOF is prepared through in situ self&#8208;assembly of chiral &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), rhodamine 6G hydrazide (RGH), and tetracyanovinylindane (TCN). The embedded RGH and TCN inherit the chirality of host CDMOF, producing dual changes both in fluorescence and reflectance. RT@CDMOF is explored as a dual channel sensor for chiral discrimination of lactate enantiomers. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal the chiral binding process, and carboxylate dissociation is confirmed by impedance and solid&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A flexible membrane sensor is successfully fabricated based on RT@CDMOF for wearable health monitoring. Practical evaluation confirms the potential of fabricated membrane sensor in point&#8208;of&#8208;care health monitoring by indexing the exercise intensity. Based on above, a chiral IMPLICATION logic unit can be successfully achieved, demonstrating the promising potential of RT@CDMOF in design and assembly of novel smart devices. This work may open a new avenue to the rational design of logic chiral sensors for wearable health monitoring applications.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derived Bismuth with I&#8722; and Cs+ Dual Modification for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis and Al&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Hexagonal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals are prepared via a hot&#8208;injection method, and under cathodic potentials, are converted to Bi nanocrystals with the dual modification of I&#8722; and Cs+ on surface. The resultant catalyst exhibits great performances for CO2 reduction reaction to formate in both the H&#8208;cell and flow cell, and when used as the cathode catalyst for Al&#8208;CO2 batteries, enable simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.








Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate; however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates. Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi&#8208;based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.

Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi-based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals are prepared by a hot-injection method. The as-prepared products feature well-defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals are converted to Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an H-cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery for simultaneous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; valorization and power generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spotlight on Luminescence Thermometry: Basics, Challenges, and Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest emerging trends of luminescence (nano)thermometry are reviewed from a perspective that has not been considered so far. The theoretical framework covering ratiometric and lifetime&#8208;based luminescent thermometers, recommendable standardization practices, reliability, and reproducibility, as well as the advancing use of algorithms for thermal readout improvement are discussed. These backgrounds are complemented by cutting&#8208;edge applications, current challenges, and future directions.








Abstract
Luminescence (nano)thermometry is a remote sensing technique that relies on the temperature dependency of the luminescence features (e.g., bandshape, peak energy or intensity, and excited state lifetimes and risetimes) of a phosphor to measure temperature. This technique provides precise thermal readouts with superior spatial resolution in short acquisition times. Although luminescence thermometry is just starting to become a more mature subject, it exhibits enormous potential in several areas, e.g., optoelectronics, photonics, micro&#8208; and nanofluidics, and nanomedicine. This work reviews the latest trends in the field, including the establishment of a comprehensive theoretical background and standardized practices. The reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the technique are also discussed, along with the use of multiparametric analysis and artificial&#8208;intelligence algorithms to enhance thermal readouts. In addition, examples are provided to underscore the challenges that luminescence thermometry faces, alongside the need for a continuous search and design of new materials, experimental techniques, and analysis procedures to improve the competitiveness, accessibility, and popularity of the technology

         <title>Asymmetric Directional Control of Thermal Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Control over the directionality of thermal emission plays a fundamental role in efficient heat transport. Although nanophotonic technologies have demonstrated the capability for angular&#8208;selective thermal emission, achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems with energy directed to a single output angle remains challenging due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, we&#160;present a general strategy for achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems. With periodic perturbation and broken mirror symmetry, metasurfaces behave as resonant metagratings whose resonances can be diffracted to symmetric output angles with distinct efficiency, allowing for high emissivity towards a single direction. The asymmetric directional thermal emitter is experimentally demonstrated at mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths with high emissivity (&#949; = 0.61) at the observation angle of +30&#176;, and low emissivity (&#949;&lt;0.3) at other angles. This work highlights the potential for manipulating the directionality of thermal emission, which holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on various thermal&#8208;engineering applications.

         <title>Recent Progress of Supramolecular Chemotherapy Based on Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemotherapy is widely recognized as an effective approach for treating cancer due to its ability to eliminate cancer cells using chemotherapeutic drugs. However, traditional chemotherapy suffers from various drawbacks, including limited solubility and stability of drugs, severe side effects, low bioavailability, drug resistance, and challenges in tracking treatment efficacy. These limitations greatly hinder its widespread clinical application. In contrast, supramolecular chemotherapy, which relies host&#8211;guest interactions, presents a promising alternative by offering highly efficient and minimally toxic anticancer drug delivery. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions. We emphasize the significant role it plays in guiding cancer therapy. Drawing on a wealth of cutting&#8208;edge research, we aim to present a timely and valuable resource for individuals interested in the field of supramolecular chemotherapy or cancer therapy. Furthermore, we aspire to contribute to progression of the field of supramolecular chemotherapy toward clinical application.

         <title>Mitochondrion&#8208;Inspired Magnesium&#8208;Oxygen Biobattery With High Energy Density in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable batteries are urgently needed as a power source to meet the demands of the next generation of biomedical electronic devices. However, existing implantable batteries suffer from unsatisfactory energy densities, hindering the miniaturization of these devices. Here, we report on a mitochondrion&#8208;inspired magnesium&#8208;oxygen biobattery that achieves both high energy density and biocompatibility in vivo. The resulting biobattery exhibits a recorded energy density of 2517 Wh&#183;L&#8211;1/1491 Wh&#183;kg&#8211;1 based on the total volume/mass of the device in vivo, which is &#8764;2.5 times higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, and can adapt to different environments for stable discharges. The volume of the magnesium&#8208;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm3 and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance implantable batteries.

Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, w e propose a novel method that leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8208;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. O ur approach involves in the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8208;electrostatic tweezer that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting, stable transport in clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with the freedom to move in three dimensions, but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8208;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

         <title>Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles by a Step&#8208;Alloying Strategy as a Superior Multifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle (HEA&#8208;NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;Hmix of 45&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. This strategy further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is significant for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion.

Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;m KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;m MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;m KOH. The work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

&lt;p&gt;A step-alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high-entropy-alloy nanoparticle (HEA-NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy-alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step-alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA-NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich-Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA-NPs-(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA-NPs-(14) only requires the ultralow overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits ultralong durability for 400 and 264&#160;h under 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH, respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH-universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA-NPs-(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; MeOH and a half-wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH.

         <title>Inducing Single Spin&#8208;Polarized Flat Bands in Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several years of research have demonstrated that graphene is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;gen electronics. In this regard, the capability of rendering it spin&#8208;polarized opens up the doors of the spintronic field. In this work, it is demonstrated that single spin&#8208;polarized bands are formed near the Fermi level by interfacing a graphene layer grown on a cobalt film with europium.








Abstract
Due to the fundamental and technological implications in driving the appearance of non&#8208;trivial, exotic topological spin textures and emerging symmetry&#8208;broken phases, flat electronic bands in 2D materials, including graphene, are nowadays a relevant topic in the field of spintronics. Here, via europium doping, single spin&#8208;polarized bands are generated in monolayer graphene supported by the Co(0001) surface. The doping is controlled by Eu positioning, allowing for the formation of a K&#175;$\bar{\mathrm{K}}$&#8208;valley localized single spin&#8208;polarized low&#8208;dispersive parabolic band close to the Fermi energy when Eu is on top, and of a &#960;* flat band with single spin&#160;character when Eu is intercalated underneath graphene. In the latter case, Eu also induces a bandgap opening at the Dirac point while the Eu 4f states act as a spin filter, splitting the &#960; band into two spin&#8208;polarized branches. The generation of flat bands with single spin character, as revealed by the spin&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, opens up new pathways toward the realization of spintronic devices exploiting such novel exotic electronic and magnetic states.

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dramatic modifications of the surface electronic structures of the magnetic topological insulator compounds MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 are directly visualized using micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A general method to achieve a minimal dispersion with topological bands close to the Fermi energy is demonstrated across the compounds.








Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present study in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that place the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this study, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization, and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications can provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

         <title>The Importance of Effective Ligand Concentration to Direct Epithelial Cell Polarity in Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the effective ligand concentration is engineered into dynamic, supramolecular hydrogels via bioactive peptide ligands that are robustly incorporated in supramolecular fibers. Epithelial cell polarity is regulated by a tension&#8208;based balance between cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8722;cell interactions, which is dominated by the effective ligand concentration in 2D, while in 3D also the bulk stiffness plays a role.








Abstract
Epithelial cysts and organoids are multicellular hollow structures formed by correctly polarized epithelial cells. Important in steering these cysts from single cells is the dynamic regulation of extracellular matrix presented ligands, and matrix dynamics. Here, control over the effective ligand concentration is introduced, decoupled from bulk and local mechanical properties, in synthetic dynamic supramolecular hydrogels formed through noncovalent crosslinking of supramolecular fibers. Control over the effective ligand concentration is realized by 1) keeping the ligand concentration constant, but changing the concentration of nonfunctionalized molecules or by 2) varying the ligand concentration, while keeping the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules constant. The&#160;results show that in 2D, the effective ligand concentration within the&#160;supramolecular fibers rather than gel stiffness (from 0.1 to 8&#160;kPa) regulates epithelial polarity. In 3D, increasing the effective ligand concentration from 0.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m strengthens the effect of increased gel stiffness from 0.1 to 2&#160;kPa, to synergistically yield more correctly polarized cysts. Through integrin manipulation, it is&#160;shown that epithelial polarity is regulated by tension&#8208;based homeostasis between cells and matrix. The&#160;results reveal the effective ligand concentration as influential factor in regulating epithelial polarity and provide insights on engineering of synthetic biomaterials for cell and organoid culture.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

The velocity-, pressure-, and temperature-fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid-filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Lattice Compressive Strain of Pt&#8208;Skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong confinement effect induced by modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC effectively ensures the ultrasmall size of Pt&#8208;based intermetallics and enhances the durability of the catalyst. The strain of Pt skins imposed by intermetallic cores is tailored to optimize the adsorption properties of the catalyst for intermediates of oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in highly effective and durable oxygen reduction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores is tailored for highly effective ORR through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promote Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultrasmall size (average size of &lt;4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles&#160;and sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are 11&#8208; and 15&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30&#160;000 cycles, and even 95% for 100&#160;000 cycles, while Pt/C retains only 51.2% for 30&#160;000 cycles. Rationalized by density functional theory, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Symmetry Control of Unconventional Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques in IrO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional spin&#8211;orbits have the potential for field&#8208;free switching of perpendicular magnetic materials which is desired for next generation spintronic devices. Low symmetry requirements, however, have limited the number of materials hosting unconventional spin transport. Here, epitaxial design is used to study which symmetry elements restrict unconventional spin transport providing a new route for discovering next generation spintronic materials.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torques generated by a spin current are key to magnetic switching in spintronic applications. The polarization of the spin current dictates the direction of switching required for energy&#8208;efficient devices. Conventionally, the polarizations of these spin currents are restricted to be along a certain direction due to the symmetry of the material allowing only for efficient in&#8208;plane magnetic switching. Unconventional spin&#8211;orbit torques arising from novel spin current polarizations, however, have the potential to switch other magnetization orientations such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which is desired for higher density spintronic&#8208;based memory devices. Here, it is demonstrated that low crystalline symmetry is not required for unconventional spin&#8211;orbit torques and can be generated in a nonmagnetic high symmetry material, iridium dioxide (IrO2), using epitaxial design. It is shown that by reducing the relative crystalline symmetry with respect to the growth direction large unconventional spin currents can be generated and hence spin&#8211;orbit torques. Furthermore, the spin polarizations detected in (001), (110), and (111) oriented IrO2 thin films are compared to show which crystal symmetries restrict unconventional spin transport. Understanding and tuning unconventional spin transport generation in high symmetry materials can provide a new route towards energy&#8208;efficient magnetic switching in spintronic devices.

Bright deep&#8208;red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer (FET). The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs display high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Hydrogel Electrolytes Based on Slide&#8208;Ring Pseudo&#8208;Polyrotaxane for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring&#8208;shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn2+ transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries at 5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion&#8208;transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single&#8208;Zn&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxane structure. The SIHE exhibits a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and a high ionic conductivity of 22.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Symmetric batteries with SIHE demonstrate stable Zn plating/stripping performance for over 160 h, with a homogenous and smooth Zn deposition layer. Full cells with La&#8208;V2O5 cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 439 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible ZIBs display stable electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, such as bending, cutting, puncturing, and soaking. This work provides a simple design strategy for single&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolytes, which could pave the way for long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.








Abstract
2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed&#8208;induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.

         <title>Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.








Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load.

     alt="Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well-Defined Crease Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well-defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation-dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well-defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating-induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well-designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade-off between the abilities of jacking-up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralow Tip&#8208;Force Driven Sizable&#8208;Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable&#8208;area (2500 times larger than the tip&#8208;surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer&#8208;thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6, driving by a single&#8208;point ultralow tip&#8208;force with the surface intact.








Abstract
Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano&#8208;tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip&#8208;force. Here it is demonstrated that the deliberate engineering of transverse flexoelectricity offers a powerful tool for improving the mechanical domain switching. Sizable&#8208;area domain switching under an ultralow tip&#8208;force can be realized in suspended van der Waals ferroelectrics with the surface intact, due to the enhanced transverse flexoelectric field. The film thickness range for domain switching in suspended ferroelectrics is significantly improved by an order of magnitude to hundreds of nanometers, being far beyond the limited range of the substrate&#8208;supported ones. The experimental results and phase&#8208;field simulations further reveal the crucial role of the transverse flexoelectricity in the domain manipulation. This large&#8208;scale mechanical manipulation of ferroelectric domain provides opportunities for the flexoelectricity&#8208;based domain controls in emerging low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and related devices.

         <title>Mdm2 Targeting Reassembly Peptide (Trap) Nanoparticles For P53 Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. Our results revealed that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF was inhibited in p53&#8208;wild type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild type tumors. Therefore, we developed ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy. Our results elucidated that the MtrapNPs responded to and formed a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilized and activated p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs were used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibited significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, our study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild type tumors. Thus, the novel MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are of great significance for alleviating the growing energy crisis by providing efficient and sustainable energy storage solution. However, the multiple issues associated with the diverse components in a battery system as well as the interphase problems greatly hinder their applications. Proteins and its subunits, peptides and amino acids, are versatile biomolecules. Functional groups in different amino acids endow these biomolecules with unique properties including the self&#8208;assembly, ion conducting, antioxidation, great affinity to exterior species, etc. Besides, protein and its subunit materials can not only work in solid forms, but also in liquid forms when dissolved in solutions, making them more versatile to realize materials engineering via diverse approaches. In this review, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding about the properties of proteins and its subunits, and research progress of using these versatile biomolecules to address the engineering issues of various rechargeable batteries, including alkali&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, metal&#8208;air batteries, and flow batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in electrode, electrolyte, separator, binder, catalyst, interphase modification, as well as recycle of rechargeable batteries are involved, and the impacts of biomolecules on electrochemical properties are particularly emphasized. Finally, perspectives on this interesting field are also provided.

         <title>Boosting The Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing The Competitive Adsorption of Organic And OH&#8722; Over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by 1) low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures were synthesized using a novel in&#8208;situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; could be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in&#8208;situ characterizations, contact angle analysis and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibited excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple&#8208;Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, And Anionic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high&#8208;performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core&#8208;shell PBAs were employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enabled the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that resulted in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presented ultra&#8208;low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming leading&#8208;edge PBA&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity was revealed, assisted by DFT calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs were found to help turn the PBAs into Se&#8208;doped core&#8208;shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation were combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway.

The resulting material presented ultra-low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming leading-edge PBA-based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity was revealed, assisted by DFT calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs were found to help turn the PBAs into Se-doped core-shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation were combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Patterning Complex Line Motifs in Thin Films Using Immersion Controlled Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of self&#8208;organization principles that enable scalable routes towards complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here reaction&#8208;diffusion driven, immersion controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced, a self&#8208;organization strategy using immersion controlled reaction&#8208;diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction&#8208;diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands&#8208;on tunability of the line spacing (d = 10 &#8722; 300&#8201;&#181;m) as well as error&#8208;correction against defects. This immersion&#8208;driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi&#8208;dimensional patterns such as square&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, rectangle&#8208; and triangle&#8208;shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer&#8208;scale diffraction gratings with user&#8208;defined features as well as an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.

By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction-diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front.

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;doped Carbon Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate the energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient and durable catalysts. Here, we report the design of N&#8208;doped carbon coated Co nanoparticles (NPs) as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of this Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability. In this study, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex 3D deformations including bending, twisting, and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Modulating Zinc Metal Reversibility by Confined Antifluctuator Film for Durable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the designed Zn anode antifluctuator that well integrates conductivity, buffering, mechanical strength, and anti&#8208;corrosion characteristics, the symmetric and full cell both deliver super&#8208;high cycling performance and enable the realization of the integration with electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device as artificial neural networks, and the integrated device achieves excellent linearity and handwritten digit recognition rate.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, the porous Zn@C solid, hollow, and yolk&#8211;shell microsphere films are developed as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8211;shell microspheres (Zn@C yolk&#8211;shell microsphere [ZCYSM]) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2&#160;at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) are integrated to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of a perovskite oxide is significantly promoted by a facile metal&#8211;vacancy strategy. The newly developed vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite nanofibers exhibit comparable activities to the commercial Pt/C and even surpass it under low temperature. The developed catalyst can drive knittable fibrous&#8208;type and sandwich&#8208;type zinc&#8211;air batteries under low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with impressive performance.








Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8211;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics and enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

Abstract
The integration of microorganisms and engineered artificial components has shown considerable promise for creating biohybrid microrobots. The unique features of microalgae make them attractive candidates as natural actuation materials for the design of biohybrid microrobotic systems. In this review, w e will introduce microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots for diverse biomedical and environmental applications. W e will describe first the distinct propulsion and phototaxis behaviors of green microalgae as well as important properties from other photosynthetic microalga systems (blue&#8208;green algae and diatom) that are crucial to constructing powerful biohybrid microrobots. W e then focus on chemical and physical routes for functionalizing the algae surface with diverse reactive materials towards the fabrication of advanced biohybrid microalgae robots. Finally, w e present representative applications of such algae&#8208;driven microrobots, including drug delivery, imaging, and water decontamination, highlighting the distinct advantages of these active biohybrid robots, along with future prospects and challenges.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Structure Binder Achieves Highly Integrated Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>

Abstract
As a promising component for next&#8208;generation high energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, silicon&#8208;based electrode has attracted increasing attention by virtue of ultrahigh theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, fast capacity fade posed by tremendous silicon&#8208;based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large&#8208;scale applications. Herein we develop an aqueous&#8208;oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon&#8208;based electrodes. In AOB binder, the hydrophobic tetrazole groups&#8208;containing polymer (donate as PPB) and water&#8208;soluble amorphous poly(acrylic acid) mimicks the &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix structure of spidroin, respectively. Benefitted by such biomimetic design, AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life. Such a strategy endows a 3.3 Ah soft package cells assembled with Si/C composite anode and NCM811 cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 2.92 Ah after 700 cycles. This work marks a milestone in developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicon&#8208;based electrodes towards high energy density lithium battery applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;based Three&#8208;Dimensional Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of submicron particles. While films, droplets and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, we report a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into three&#8208;dimensional objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment. Rheology, photopolymerization and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering and optical characterization, we show that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating three&#8208;dimensional objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>High&#8208;density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;shaped CMOS backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VRss) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g. as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and an ultrastable passivation, e.g. to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. Here, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs were deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy were performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers led to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitated direct vacuum deposition of orange and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allowed to switch each pixel individually. OLED pixels generated a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW/mm2, corresponding to &gt;40,000&#160;cd/m2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self-organization in a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell-like entities (protocells) under non-equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell-sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non-equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self-oscillating cell-sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life-like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The founding objective of structural DNA nanoscience is demonstrated by using self&#8208;assembled DNA scaffolds for the structure determination of biomolecules by X&#8208;ray diffraction. A structural library of 32 metal&#8208;mediated DNA base pairs (mmDNA) with Ag+, Hg2+, and Au+is assembled and the fundamental design rules for an expanded mmDNA coding system further elucidated, toward the development of molecular electronics and designer nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs are constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials is impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination is explored. The tensegrity triangle is employed to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and generalized design rules for mmDNA construction are elucidated. Two binding modes are uncovered: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations show additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Optical Switching of Hole Transfer in Double&#8208;Perovskite/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole&#8208;transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported. This provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a semiconductor/graphene heterojunction.








Abstract
Synergically combining their respective ultrahigh charge mobility and strong light absorption, graphene (Gr)/semiconductor heterostructures are promising building blocks for efficient optoelectronics, particularly photodetectors. Charge transfer (CT) across the heterostructure interface crucially determines device efficiency and functionality. Here, it is reported that hole&#8208;transfer processes dominate the ultrafast CT across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene (DP/Gr) heterostructures following optical excitation. While holes are the primary charges flowing across interfaces, their transfer direction, as well as efficiency, show a remarkable dependence on the excitation wavelength. For excitation with photon energies below the bandgap of DPs, the photoexcited hot holes in Gr can compete with the thermalization process and inject into in&#8208;gap defect states in DPs. In contrast, above&#8208;bandgap excitation of DP reverses the hole&#8208;transfer direction, leading to hole transfer from the valence band of DPs to Gr. Experimental evidence that increasing the excitation photon energy enhances CT efficiency for both below&#8208; and above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation regimes is further provided, unveiling the positive role of excess energy in enhancing interfacial CT. The possibility of switching the hole&#8208;transfer direction and thus the interfacial photogating field by tuning the excitation wavelength, provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a DP/Gr heterojunction.

         <title>Quantum Dots Facilitate 3D Two&#8208;Photon Laser Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D two&#8208;photon laser lithography is considered a disruptive nanostructuring technology in many fields. However, enhancing the printing resolution and developing new printing materials are still in much demand. In this work, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this situation, by incorporating chemically modified quantum dots, is presented, showing superb performance improvement. The resolution enhancement mechanism is then further elucidated.








Abstract
In the past two decades, direct laser writing (DLW) technologies have seen tremendous growth. However, strategies that enhance the printing resolution and the development of printing material with assorted functionalities are still sparser than expected. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this bottleneck is presented. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are selected to carry out this task, most importantly via surface chemistry modification to enable their copolymerization with themonomers, resulting in transparent composites. The evaluations indicate that the QDs show great colloidal stability and their photoluminescent properties are well&#8208;preserved. This allows further exploration of the printing characteristics of such composite material. It is shown that in the presence of the QDs, the material provides a much lower polymerization threshold with faster linewidth growth, indicating that the QDs form a synergetic relationship with the monomer and the photoinitiator, widening the dynamic range of the material and thus increasing the writing efficiency for broader fields of applications. Lowering the polymerization threshold reduces the minimum achievable feature size by &#8776;32%, which is well&#8208;matched with STED&#8208;based (i.e., stimulated&#8208;emission depletion microscopy) methods in writing 3D structures. The study further elucidates the mechanism of the synergetic behavior, further guiding the future development of functional materials for DLW&#8208;related printing technologies.

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Phase Recycling of Metals from Li&#8208;Ion Batteries in Rotating, Concentric&#8208;Liquid Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal mixtures from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are rapidly and selectively separated one&#8208;pot in a rotating, concentric&#8208;liquid reactor. In this reactor, vigorous stirring at interfacial regions does not cause mixing of the aqueous metal&#8208;feed and acceptor layers, while the organic extractants are allowed to shuttle between these layers multiple times.








Abstract
Efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for making their numerous applications sustainable. Hydrometallurgy&#8208;based separation methods are an indispensable part of the recycling process but remain limited by the extraction efficiency and selectivity, and typically require numerous binary liquid&#8211;liquid extraction steps in which the capacity of the extracting organic phase or partition coefficient of extracted metals become an overall bottleneck. Herein, rotating reactors are described, in which the aqueous feed, organic extractant, and aqueous acceptor phases are all present in the same rotating vessel and can be vigorously stirred and emulsified without the coalescence of aqueous layers. In this arrangement, the extractant molecules are not equilibrated with the feed and, instead, &#8220;shuttle&#8221; between the feed/extractant and the extractant/acceptor interfaces multiple times, with each such molecule ultimately transferring approximately ten metal ions. This shuttling allows for using extractant concentrations much lower than in previous designs even for extremely concentrated feeds and, simultaneously, ensures unprecedented speed and selectivity of the one&#8208;pot processes. These experimental results are accompanied by theoretical considerations of the selectivity versus speed trends as well as discussion of parameters essential for system upscaling.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale observation directly shows that a significant amount of oxygen loss is induced exclusively by lattice strain in pristine layered oxides without any electrochemical Li extraction under high voltage application. This work offers crucial insight toward the importance of strain relaxation to suppress oxygen loss for better cycling performance of layered oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading are critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#63743;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single-crystal LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic-column-resolved imaging reveals that local Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Layered and Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anodes in Ester Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative interface catalysis mechanism is developed to controllably design a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on hard carbon anodes in ester electrolytes by surface&#8208;reconstruction with abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds, which are active centers for preferentially catalyzing salt reduction. Due to such rationally regulated SEI, sodium&#8208;storage performance regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability is comprehensively enhanced.








Abstract
Constructing a homogenous and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium&#8208;storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium&#8208;storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g&#8722;1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high&#8208;performance HC anodes for sodium storage.

         <title>Mobile Kink Solitons in a Van der Waals Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile solitons are discovered in a van der Waals material as kinks and antikinks along domain walls in the 2D layer with spontaneously broken symmetry. The mobility, electronic states, and topology of kink solitons are elucidated, which makes the application of solitons in van der Waals electronic materials promising.








Abstract
Kinks, point&#8208;like geometrical defects along dislocations, domain walls, and DNA, are stable and mobile, as solutions of a sine&#8208;Gordon wave equation. While they are widely investigated for crystal deformations and domain wall motions, electronic properties of individual kinks have received little attention. In this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of 1T&#8208;TaS2. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures and in&#8208;gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger solitons. The twelvefold degeneracy of the domain walls in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der Waals materials&#160;architectures.

         <title>Design of Fluoro&#8208;Free Surfaces Super&#8208;Repellent to Low&#8208;Surface&#8208;Tension Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread use of perfluoroalkyls for super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces is environmentally unsustainable, motivating the exploration of fluoro&#8208;free alternatives. In this work, the concept of liquid&#8208;centric design and the revised limits for using fluoro&#8208;free materials (hydrocarbons and silicones) in achieving super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids is demonstrated. Scale bar in image: 1 mm. 








Abstract
Super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces feature high liquid contact angles and low sliding angles find key applications in anti&#8208;fouling and self&#8208;cleaning. While repellency for water is easily achieved with hydrocarbon functionalities, repellency for many low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (down to 30 mN&#160;m&#8722;1) still requires perfluoroalkyls (a persistent environmental pollutant and bioaccumulation hazard). Here, the scalable room&#8208;temperature synthesis of stochastic nanoparticle surfaces with fluoro&#8208;free moieties is investigated. Silicone (dimethyl and monomethyl) and hydrocarbon surface chemistries are benchmarked against perfluoroalkyls, assessed using model low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (ethanol&#8211;water mixtures). It is discovered that both hydrocarbon&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;silicone&#8208;based functionalization can achieve super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency down to 40&#8211;41 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 and 32&#8211;33 mN&#160;m&#8722;1, respectively (vs&#160;27&#8211;32 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 for perfluoroalkyls). The dimethyl silicone variant demonstrates superior fluoro&#8208;free liquid repellency likely due to its denser dimethyl molecular configuration. It is shown that perfluoroalkyls are not necessary for many real&#8208;world scenarios requiring super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency. Effective super&#8208;repellency of different surface chemistries against different liquids can be adequately predicted using empirically verified phase diagrams. These findings encourage a liquid&#8208;centric design, i.e., tailoring surfaces for target liquid properties. Herein, key guidelines are provided for achieving functional yet sustainably designed super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency.

         <title>Hydroiodic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths toward Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelation&#8211;densification approach of MXenes to produce thick and dense electrodes with superhigh areal capacitance is proposed. Hydroiodide acids can not only serve as initiators to trigger the gelation of MXenes and construct stable 3D&#160;networks, but also leave highly shrinking porous structures by application of capillary forces during their controlled removal.








Abstract
The assembly of 3D&#160;structured materials from 2D&#160;units paves a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which are long sought after for practical energy&#8208;storage devices. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) are promising for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet face huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion&#8208;transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8211;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger gelation, while HI serves as a spacer to prevent nanosheets from restacking during capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;Area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of interfacial forces during the transfer process, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized, which is compatible with batch production of graphene wafers on target substrates.








Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities is successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles, and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of chemical vaport deposition (CVD) graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Piezoelectric BiO2&#8722;x Nanosheets for Augmented Piezocatalytic, Sonothermal, and Enzymatic Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheet is developed by a defect engineering strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lowering the energy gap, and is applied for the synergistic piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies. Density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancies are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy is a new&#8208;emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;enabled therapeutic strategy that relies on built&#8208;in electric field and energy&#8208;band bending of piezoelectric materials activated by ultrasound (US) irradiation. Despite becoming a hot topic, material development and mechanism exploration are still underway. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheets (NSs) demonstrate outstanding piezoelectric properties. Under US, a piezo&#8208;potential of 0.25&#160;V for BiO2&#8722;x NSs is sufficient to tilt the conduction band to be more negative than the redox potentials of O2/&#8226;O2&#8722;, &#8226;O2&#8722;/H2O2, and H2O2/&#8226;OH, which initiates a cascade reaction for ROS generation. Moreover, the BiO2&#8722;x NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase&#8208;like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H2O2&#8208;overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO2&#8722;x NSs are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.

         <title>A Composite of Hierarchical Porous MOFs and Halloysite Nanotubes as Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A novel H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT composite of hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 and hollow halloysite nanotube is employed as an electrolyte in lithium&#8208;ion conduction in solid&#8208;state batteries, presenting excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material have emerged in the field of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). In this work, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material is harvested through the in situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and Li+&#8208;transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 is further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{+}}$ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE has efficient lithium&#8208;dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogels featuring a &#8220;porous brick and fiber&#8221; architecture are fabricated via in situ nanoscale hetero&#8208;assembly and ambient pressure drying, in which mesoporous minerals are generated in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The aerogels integrate challenging requirements of thermal superinsulation, excellent compressive stiffness, superelasticity, high bending flexibility, good impact resistance, and easy scalability for robust thermal management under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel, synthesized via in situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network, is reported. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8211;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulting aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). These aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.








Abstract
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy&#8208;storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+. In this study, an ultrafast, universal, and cost&#8208;effective superfilling approach is developed to construct a metal artificial interface decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and 2D&#160;diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes can be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributes to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled&#8208;up Sn@Zn//&#946;&#8208;MnO2 cells. Given the facile and cost&#8208;effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, this work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialization, and commercialization purposes.

         <title>Incorporating Wireless Strategies to Wearable Devices Enabled by a Photocurable Hydrogel&#160;for Monitoring Pressure Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocurable hydrogel is developed to implement a two&#8208;in&#8208;one wearable device with a simple structure, which can quantify and visualize pressure simultaneously. Incorporated with wireless strategies, two integrated systems of smart patch and passive sensing are demonstrated, showing the potential for timely and on&#8208;site monitoring of physiological signals, and human&#8211;machine interfaces for various pressure information acquisition.








Abstract
Advances in emerging technologies for wireless collection and the timely analysis of various information captured by wearable devices are of growing interest. Herein, a crosslinked ionic hydrogel prepared by a facile photocuring process is proposed, which&#160;allows wearable devices to be further incorporated into two wireless integrated systems for pressure monitoring applications. The device exhibits a simplified structure by effectively sharing functional layers, rather than conventional two separate combinations, offering the salient performance of iontronic sensing and electrochromic properties to simultaneously quantify and visualize pressure. The developed smart patch system is demonstrated to monitor physiological signals in real&#8208;time utilizing the user interface of remote portable equipment with the Bluetooth protocol and on&#8208;site electrochromic displays. Moreover, a passive wireless system based on the magnetic coupling effect is designed, which can operate free from the battery and simultaneously acquire multiple pressure information. It is envisioned that the strategies would hold enormous potential for flexible electronics, versatile sensing platforms, and wireless on&#8208;body networks.

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for&#160;Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as a prototype, oxygen vacancies are found to introduce shallow energy levels, and deep energy levels are identified. More surface oxygen vacancies induces the formation of deeper surface trapped states to enhance charge separation and introduce more low&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr centers to boost water oxidation activity.








Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. In this work, the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) are regulated via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. Oxygen vacancies identified in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere induces the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of the PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in the PbCrO4 photoanode, a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated AM1.5G is acheived. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing the water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Enzymatic Regulation of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein is loaded in coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells, and client proteins are taken up based on their affinity for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which can be regulated by their phosphorylation state. Using a kinase or phosphatase, protein&#8211;protein interactions of native interaction domains are regulated in situ. This system mimics the recruitment of client proteins to biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Membraneless organelles are important for spatial organization of proteins and regulation of intracellular processes. Proteins can be recruited to these condensates by specific protein&#8211;protein or protein&#8211;nucleic acid interactions, which are often regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications. However, the mechanisms behind these dynamic, affinity&#8208;based protein recruitment events are not well understood. Here, a coacervate system that incorporates the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein to study enzymatically regulated recruitment of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;binding proteins is presented, which mostly bind in a phosphorylation&#8208;dependent manner. Synthetic coacervates are efficiently loaded with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, and phosphorylated binding partners, such as the c&#8208;Raf pS233/pS259 peptide (c&#8208;Raf), show 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;dependent sequestration with up to 161&#8208;fold increase in local concentration. The c&#8208;Raf domain is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf) to demonstrate recruitment of proteins. In situ phosphorylation of GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf by a kinase leads to enzymatically regulated uptake. The introduction of a phosphatase into coacervates preloaded with the phosphorylated 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf complex results in a significant cargo efflux mediated by dephosphorylation. Finally, the general applicability of this platform to study protein&#8211;protein interactions is demonstrated by the phosphorylation&#8208;dependent and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated active reconstitution of a split&#8208;luciferase inside artificial cells. This work presents an approach to study dynamically regulated protein recruitment in condensates, using native interaction domains.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Depolymerizable &#948;&#8208;Lactone Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerizable vitrimers are developed through a one&#8208;pot synthesis approach. The low&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature polymer from the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the biobased &#948;&#8208;lactone is cross&#8208;linked with dynamic acetal linkages. The cross&#8208;linked vitrimer allows reprocessing and healing and can easily depolymerize back to monomers for closed&#8208;loop recycling. These vitrimers exhibit excellent properties, making them a biobased and sustainable replacement for conventional soft elastomers.








Abstract
A depolymerizable vitrimer that allows both reprocessability and monomer recovery by a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of vitrimers from cyclic lactones is reported. Biobased &#948;&#8208;valerolactone with alkyl substituents (&#948;&#8208;lactone) has low ceiling temperature; thus, their ring&#8208;opening&#8208;polymerized aliphatic polyesters are capable of depolymerizing back to monomers. In this work, the amorphous poly(&#948;&#8208;lactone) is solidified into an elastomer (i.e., &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer) by a vinyl ether cross&#8208;linker with dynamic acetal linkages, giving the merits of reprocessing and healing. Thermolysis of the bulk &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer at 200&#160;&#176;C can recover 85&#8211;90&#160;wt% of the material, allowing reuse without losing value and achieving a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle. It further demonstrates that the new vitrimer has excellent properties, with the potential to serve as a biobased and sustainable replacement of conventional soft elastomers for various applications such as lenses, mold materials, soft robots, and microfluidic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cellulose&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8208;Based Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)&#8208;based luminescent shape&#8208;memory polymers are fabricated by integrating the self&#8208;assembly of CNCs with a co&#8208;polymerization strategy. By sequential hot&#8208;pressing and recovery through heating, circularly polarized luminescence can be switched on and off due to the pressure&#8208;responsive chiral nematic structures.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials that display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great attention for application in chiral sensors and smart displays. However, due to difficulties in the regulation of chiral structures, fine control of CPL remains a challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that cellulose nanocrystal shape&#8208;memory polymers (CNC&#8208;SMPs) with luminescent components enable mechanically responsive CPL. The chiral nematic organization of CNCs in the material gives rise to a photonic bandgap. By manipulating the photonic bandgap or luminescence wavelengths of the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs, precise control of CPL emission with varied wavelengths and high dissymmetry factors (glum) is achieved. Specifically, CPL emission can be switched reversibly by treating the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs with hot&#8208;pressing and recovery by heating. Pressure&#8208;responsive CPL with tunable glum values is ascribed to the pressure&#8208;responsive photonic bandgaps. Moreover, colorimetric and CPL&#8208;active patterns are created by imprinting desired forms into SMP samples. This study demonstrates a novel way to fabricate smart CPL systems using biomaterials.

         <title>Synchronous Interventions of Glucose and Mitochondrial Metabolisms for Antitumor Bioenergetic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycopolymer containing a caged hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide dual&#8208;donor is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase for synchronous interventions of glucose and mitochondrial metabolisms of tumors.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;based mitochondrial bioenergetic intervention is an attractive therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited owing to metabolic plasticity, which allows tumors to shift their metabolic phenotype between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis for energy compensation. To overcome this flexibility, a glycopolymer containing a caged H2S and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dual&#8208;donor (1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose [thioglucose]) is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase (GOx) for complete depletion of tumorigenic energy sources. The loaded GOx catalyzes the glutathione&#8208;activated thioglucose to generate cytotoxic H2S/H2O2, which further induces synergistic defects in mitochondrial function by suppressing cytochrome&#160;c oxidase expression and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential. GOx also blocks glycolysis by depleting endogenous glucose. This synchronous intervention strategy exhibits good anticancer performance, broadening the horizon of antitumor bioenergetic therapy.

         <title>Achieving Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries by a Dual&#8208;Anion Regulated Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte&#160;is developed for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The electrolyte enables fast interfacial kinetics and forms robust inorganic&#8208;rich and highly ion&#8208;conductive electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layers on the surfaces of the electrodes, demonstrates exceptional performance in Li||NCM83 pouch cells, and realizes LMBs&#160;with an ultrahigh capacity of 39.0 Ah and ultrahigh energy density of 521&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) using lithium&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes have been deemed as one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology. However, its practical application is largely hindered by the notorious dendrite growth of lithium&#8208;metal anodes, the fast structure degradation of the cathode, and insufficient electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase kinetics. Here, a dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte is developed for LMBs using lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium difluoro(bisoxalato)phosphate (LiDFBOP) as anion regulators. The incorporation of TFSI&#8722; in the solvation sheath reduces the desolvation energy of Li+, and DFBOP&#8722; promotes the formation of highly ion&#8208;conductive and sustainable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the electrodes. Significantly enhanced performance is demonstrated on Li||LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 pouch cells, with 84.6% capacity retention after 150 cycles in 6.0 Ah pouch cells and an ultrahigh rate capability up to 5 C in 2.0 Ah pouch cells. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an ultralarge capacity of 39.0 Ah is fabricated and achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 521.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The findings provide a facile electrolyte design strategy for promoting the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Shift&#8208;Current Photovoltaics Based on a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Phase in In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric SnS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking phase of 2D tin sulfide (SnS) is successfully achieved on van der Waals substrates and the shift current in SnS is demonstrated. Following the PFM observation that reveals the existence of ferroelectric domains, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed.








Abstract
The shift&#8208;current photovoltaics of group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides has been predicted to be comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Enhancing Prosthetic Control through High&#8208;Fidelity Myoelectric Mapping with Molecular Anchoring Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, molecular anchoring, is applied to improve the detection and quality of low&#8208;level myoelectric signals through gel electrode interacting with and embedding into stratum corneum. Due to high&#8208;fidelity signals based on the anchoring electrodes, the system enables an amputee to drive a prosthesis with phantom limb dexterity.








Abstract
Myoelectric control utilizes electrical signals generated from the voluntary contraction of remaining muscles in an amputee's stump to operate a prosthesis. Precise and agile control requires low&#8208;level myoelectric signals (below 10% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from weak muscle contractions such as phantom finger or wrist movements, but imbalanced calcium concentration in atrophic skin can distort the signals. This is due to poor ionic&#8211;electronic coupling between skin and electrode, which often causes excessive muscle contraction, fatigue, and discomfort during delicate tasks. To overcome this challenge, a new strategy called molecular anchoring is developed to drive hydrophobic molecular effectively interact with and embed into stratum corneum for high coupling regions between ionic fluxes and electronic currents. The use of hydrophobic poly(N&#8208;vinyl caprolactam) gel has resulted in an interface impedance of 20&#160;k&#937;, which is 1/100 of a commercial acrylic&#8208;based electrode, allowing the detection of ultralow myoelectric signals (&#8776;1.5% MVC) that approach human limits. With this molecular anchoring technology, amputees operate a prosthesis with greater dexterity, as phantom finger and wrist movements are predicted with 97.6% accuracy. This strategy provides the potential for a comfortable human&#8211;machine interface when amputees accomplish day&#8208;to&#8208;day tasks through precise and dexterous myoelectric control.

         <title>Physicochemical Dual Cross&#8208;Linking Conductive Polymeric Networks Combining High Strength and High Toughness Enable Stable Operation of Silicon Microparticle Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid) and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber includes robust chemical cross&#8208;linking and multiple physical cross&#8208;linking. Such a design can effectively dissipate the undesirable stress of silicon microparticle anodes by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability.








Abstract
The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycling performance caused by undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) as next&#8208;generation anode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network is designed combining high strength and high toughness by coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid)&#160;and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H&#8208;bonds, by introducing highly branched tannic acid as a physical cross&#8208;linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#181;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8776;97% from 2027.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 19th to 1968.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 200th cycle at 2 A g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stabilizing SiOx anodes with a much lower capacity loss of &#8776;0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress&#8208;distribution ability of the physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network. This work provides an efficient energy&#8208;dissipation strategy toward practical high&#8208;capacity anodes for energy&#8208;dense batteries.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Energy Transfer between Dye&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles: Observation and Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operating range of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5 nm. A study of dye&#8208;loaded fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles connected by DNA duplexes of different lengths reveals efficient energy transfer far beyond the F&#246;rster radius, following a power&#8208;four distance dependence. This phenomenon is applied for amplified detection of a target nucleic acid with attomole sensitivity.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light&#8208;harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5&#160;nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic F&#246;rster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP&#8211;NP distances&#160;of 15 and 20&#160;nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface NP&#8211;NP distance. Based on this long&#8208;distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at &#8776;15&#160;nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single&#8208;molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for &gt;5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection. Breaking the F&#246;rster distance limit for ultrabright NPs opens the route to advanced optical nanomaterials for amplified FRET&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Flat&#8208;Panel Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick&#8208;film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based single&#8208;pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards.

     alt="Mechanochemical Synthesis of High-Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X-ray Flat-Panel Detectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high-entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick-film-based X-ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next-generation X-ray detectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large-scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high-entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X-ray flat-panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single-crystal-based single-pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high-entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&amp;gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(I&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based X-ray flat-panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close-to-single-crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high-entropy perovskite-based X-ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new-generation&#160;X-ray-detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Nanoalloy to Nano&#8208;Laminated Interfaces for Highly Stable Alkali&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces is proposed for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes, tailoring the compositions from nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure. The required thicknesses for nanoalloy interfaces differ from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;metal anodes, and the mechanical stabilities of the interfaces affect electrochemical performances.









Abstract
Metal anodes are considered the holy grail for next&#8208;generation batteries because of their high gravimetric/volumetric specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, several unsolved challenges have impeded their practical applications, such as dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, dead layer formation, and volume change. An electrochemically, chemically, and mechanically stable artificial solid electrolyte interphase&#160;is key to addressing the aforementioned issue with metal anodes. This study demonstrates a new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes. Through tailoring the compositions of the hybrid interfaces, a nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure is realized. As a result, the nanoalloy interface (1Al2O3&#8211;1alucone or 2Al2O3&#8211;2alucone) presents the most stable electrochemical performances for both Li&#8208;and Na&#8208;metal anodes. The optimized thicknesses required for the nanoalloy interfaces for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes are different. A cohesive zone model is applied to interpret the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the mechanical stabilities of the different interfaces on the electrochemical performances is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This approach provides a fundamental understanding and establishes the bridge between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance for alkali&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple melanoma&#8208;characteristic stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator with high biocompatibility is presented, serving as a potent metabolic regulator with irreversible metabolic homeostasis disruption performances of tumor cells through the S&#8208;nitrosylation modification of key metabolic enzymes for the immunosuppressive TME reversion and ICB therapy sensitization of melanoma.








Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. In this work, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite nanogenerator APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO is constructed that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO can efficiently generate peroxynitrite through the in situ coupling of the produced superoxide anion and released nitric oxide. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated peroxynitrite induces a great decrease in metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Meanwhile, the glycolysis&#8208;produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under peroxynitrite stress. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through S&#8208;nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2&#8208;like macrophages to M1phenotype, reduction of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combining APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite overproduction approach is developed and the possible mechanism of peroxynitrite&#8208;mediated TME immunomodulation is explored, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical multiplexed differentiator with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is reported. Experiments with Gaussian beams and biological specimens showcase its excellent computation performance and versatility of simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning. The approach provides a new route toward ultra&#8208;integration and multifunctionality of all&#8208;optical computing devices and the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator can find applications in various real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
Current optical differentiators are generally limited to realizing a single differential function once fabricated. Herein, a minimalist strategy in designing multiplexed differentiators (1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations), implemented with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is proposed, thus improving the functionality of optical computing devices without the cost of complex design and nanofabrication. It is found that the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator exhibits excellent differential&#8208;computation performance and can be used for simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning of objects, corresponding to the functions of the 1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations respectively. Experiments with biological specimens showcase that boundaries of biological tissues can not only be identified, but also the edge information for realizing high&#8208;precision edge positioning is highlighted. The study provides a paradigm in designing all&#8208;optical multiplexed computing meta&#8208;devices, and initiates tri&#8208;mode surface morphology observation by combining meta&#8208;differentiator with optical microscopes, which can find their applications in advanced biological imaging, large&#8208;scale defect detection, and high&#8208;speed pattern recognition, etc.

         <title>Triggering Pt Active Sites in Basal Plane of Van der Waals PtTe2 Materials by Amorphization Engineering for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amorphous strategy is developed to trigger the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms in 2D PtTe2 materials and tailor the electronic properties of Pt active sites via the orbital hybridization with oxygen dopants. O ur findings provide an efficient strategy for designing amorphous catalysts whose number of active sites and adsorption strength to reaction intermediates are significantly increased and optimized.








Abstract
Exposing active sites and optimizing their binding strength to reaction intermediates are two essential strategies to significantly improve the catalytic performance of 2D materials. However, pursuing an efficient way to achieve these goals simultaneously remains a considerable challenge. Here, using 2D PtTe2 van der Waals material with a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, it is observed that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe2 nanosheets (c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped 2D amorphous PtTe2 NSs (a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt&#8208;Te covalent bond in c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, d&#8208;band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals. As a result, a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.

Here, using 2D PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; van der Waals material with a well-defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, it is observed that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (c-PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs) into oxygen-doped 2D amorphous PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs (a-PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt-Te covalent bond in c-PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals and O 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals. As a result, a-PtTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Third Component with Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electrostatic Dipole for Realizing High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic Donor Terpolymers</title>

         <dc:description>
PM6&#8208;based terpolymers containing a saddle&#8208;shaped group with a double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the third component designed for fabrication of polymer solar cells feature strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole for optimizing blend morphology and improving the photovoltaic performances, thus achieving 19.13% efficiency.








Abstract
Terpolymer fabrication is an effective methodology for molecular engineering and generating high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials to construct highly efficient polymer solar cells. Modification of the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component resulting in the formation of a ternary copolymer is reported to outperform PM6 in achieving enhanced device performances. However, one of the major challenges in constructing high&#8208;performance terpolymers is to counter the molecular disorder caused by the backbone entropy induced by the third moiety. In this work, double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is used as the third component, which possesses a&#160;strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole owing to the saddle&#8208;shaped B&#8592;N fused ring structure. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole moment introduced in the modified PM6 terpolymer can be used as a means for tuning and optimizing the nanostructures of the blended films. The prepared PM6&#8208;BNBP&#8208;4 blend polymer with 4% of the benzodithiophene dione monomers replaced by BNBP results in excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.13%. This work demonstrates that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole moment in saddle&#8208;shaped molecules is valuable for achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic donor materials.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;to&#8208;Air Eavesdropping with a Phase&#8208;Engineered Impedance Matching Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;engineered impedance matching metasurface is designed and experimentally demonstrated that serves as an &#8220;acoustic bridge&#8221; linking water and air nearly perfectly and enables remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping with extreme enhancement in sensitivity. This metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness opens an avenue to communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long&#8208;standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water&#8211;air interface. Here, a phase&#8208;engineered water&#8211;air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping. The judiciously designed metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water&#8211;air interface acoustically transparent and, at the same time, freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross&#8208;media orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum&#8208;multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano&#8208;optics and radio frequencies.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping of Halide Perovskites by Noble Metal Interstitial Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over doping of novel halide perovskite semiconductors has been a challenging research area, mainly due to the inability to directly measure and characterize defects. In this work, experimental and theoretical methods are combined to make a compelling case for the controlled, electrochemical formation of noble metal interstitial defects in halide perovskite materials, and their impact on n&#8208;type doping and optoelectronic properties is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are an attractive class of semiconductors, but it has proven difficult to control their electronic doping by conventional strategies due to screening and compensation by mobile ions or ionic defects. Noble&#8208;metal interstitials represent an under&#8208;studied class of extrinsic defects that plausibly influence many perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, doping of metal halide perovskites is studied by electrochemically formed Au+ interstitial ions, combining experimental data on devices with a computational analysis of Au+ interstitial defects based on density functional theory (DFT). Analysis suggests that Au+ cations can be easily formed and migrate through the perovskite bulk via the same sites as iodine interstitials (Ii+). However, whereas Ii+ compensates n&#8208;type doping by electron capture, the noble&#8208;metal interstitials act as quasi&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Experimentally, voltage&#8208;dependent, dynamic doping by current density&#8211;time (J&#8211;t), electrochemical impedance, and photoluminescence measurements are characterized. These results provide deeper insight into the potential beneficial and detrimental impacts of metal electrode reactions on long&#8208;term performance of perovskite photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, as well as offer an alternative doping explanation for the valence switching mechanism of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based neuromorphic and memristive devices.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Release of Nitric Oxide from Hafnium&#8208;Based Nanoradiosensitizers for Enhanced Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but multifunctional hafnium&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer with controlled release of NO under X&#8208;ray irradiation and cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation ability is developed for enhanced radio&#8208;immunotherapy, achieving complete elimination of cancer, especially metastasis.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an extensively used strategy for cancer treatment, but its therapeutic effect is usually limited by the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) and it lacks the ability to control tumor metastases. In this work, a nanoscale coordination polymer, Hf&#8208;nIm@PEG (HNP), is prepared by the coordination of hafnium ions (Hf4+) with 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;nIm), and then modified with lipid bilayers containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, on the one hand, Hf4+ with high computed tomography signal enhancement ability can deposit radiation energy to induce DNA damage, and on the other hand, NO can be persistently released from 2&#8208;nIm, which can not only directly react with the radical DNA to prevent the repair of damaged DNA but also relieves the hypoxic immunosuppressive TME to sensitize radiotherapy. Additionally, NO can also react with superoxide ions to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to induce cell apoptosis. More interestingly, it is discovered that Hf4+ can effectively activate the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to promote the immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Thus, this work presents a simple but multifunctional nanoscale coordination polymer to deposit radiation energy, trigger the release of NO, modulate the TME, activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and finally realize synergistic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA&#8208;origami nanotubes, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical deformation of the DNA&#8208;origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real&#8208;time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.








Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA&#8208;origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organogel artificial muscle is created through combining rational macromolecular design and twist insertion. Such tissue&#8208;like material (Young's modulus&#160;=&#160;133&#160;kPa) can generate ultra&#8208;large actuation strain (66%), ultra&#8208;fast actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), high power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), high actuation stress (0.23&#160;MPa), excellent work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), and highly stable actuation in the open&#8208;air environment.








Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8211;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8211;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power, and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG) is reported. Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments are successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Size&#8208;Transformable and Bioactivity&#8208;Switchable Self&#8208;Assembling Chimeric Peptide Nanoassemblies for Combating Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chimeric peptide nanoassembly consisting of a 14&#8208;carbon alkyl chain unit, a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#160;and pH&#8208;responsive unit, a P. aeruginosa target recognition unit, and a hydrophilic unit is developed. The nanoassemblies exhibit good bactericidal ability in acidic environments and are able to penetrate mature biofilms and kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. These results provide a reference for the development of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nanoassemblies composed of multiple functional fragments are designed for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers at pH 7.4 and is transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, and thus achieves a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nanoassemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological&#8208;environment&#8208;driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with High Oxophilicity Interfaced with PtMo Alloy Nanoparticles Boosts Anti&#8208;CO Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy for efficient hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is reported. It is demonstrated that the weakened Had binding energy and moderate hydroxyl adsorption energy can optimize the absorption behavior of key intermediates, jointly contributing to enhanced hydrogen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR suffer from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to the challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorption toward different adsorbates. Herein, this challenge is overcome by tuning an atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles (NPs) with optimized Had, OHad, and COad adsorption for boosting anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning hydrogen&#8208;cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits high kinetics and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA&#160;&#181;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3&#8208; and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of the PtMo/MoOx interface NPs simultaneously optimizes Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from the amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

         <title>Giant Electrostrain in Lead&#8208;Free Textured Piezoceramics by Defect Dipole Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant electrostrain value as high as 1.6% with low hysteresis and excellent fatigue resistance is achieved in textured BNT&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramics through the synergistic contributions of the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and, foremost, defect dipole engineering.









Abstract
By converting electrical signal into mechanical displacement, piezoelectric actuators are widely used in many applications due to their precise displacement, fast response, and small size. The unipolar electrostrain values larger than 1% reported so far are from lead&#8208;based single crystals or ceramics, which brings environmental concerns. Herein, a giant unipolar electrostrain of 1.6% with good fatigue resistance and low hysteresis in Sr/Nb&#8208;doped Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 lead&#8208;free textured piezoceramics by defect dipole design is reported, which is comparable to or even higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;based piezoelectric single crystals. The engineered defect dipoles in ergodic relaxor ferroelectrics can introduce a large internal bias field along the poling direction, where the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented defect dipoles with large polarizability aligning along the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented spontaneous polarizations of the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced ferroelectric phase greatly benefit the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of the &#12296;00l&#12297;&#8208;textured ceramic. In&#8208;depth microstructural studies reveal that the greatly enhanced electrostrain is realized by the synergistic contributions from the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and most importantly, defect dipole engineering. The present research provides a general strategy for the design of piezoceramics with high electrostrain, which is expected to be promising alternative to lead&#8208;based piezoelectric actuators.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Mechano&#8208;Actuated Biomimetic Membrane Nanopores Self&#8208;Assembled from DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanopores of complex function&#160;are built with DNA nanotechnology. The pores undergo dynamic changes in shape and can be locked in an open state by specific binding of DNA and protein stimuli, and close at high transmembrane potentials. The pores may be used in biosensing and synthetic biology.








Abstract
In bioinspired design, biological templates are mimicked in structure and function by highly controllable synthetic means. Of interest are static barrel&#8208;like nanopores that enable molecular transport across membranes for use in biosensing, sequencing, and biotechnology. However, biological ion channels offer additional functions such as dynamic changes of the entire pore shape between open and closed states, and triggering of dynamic processes with biochemical and physical stimuli. To better capture this complexity, this report presents multi&#8208;stimuli and mechano&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanopores which are created with DNA nanotechnology. The nanopores switch between open and closed states, whereby specific binding of DNA and protein molecules as stimuli locks the pores in the open state. Furthermore, the physical stimulus of high transmembrane voltage switches the pores into a closed state. In addition, the pore diameters are larger and more tunable than those of natural templates. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and mechanically actuated nanopores mimic several aspects of complex biological channels yet offer easier control over pore size, shape and stimulus response. The designer pores are expected to be applied in biosensing and synthetic biology.

         <title>A Functionalized Heterogeneous Catalyst from Atomically Precise Pd1Au8 Clusters Facilitates Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by exchanging Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the resin, realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Due to the defined coordination geometry and composition and ligand of this Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ catalyst, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship can be achieved.








Abstract
It has become possible to establish a connection between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with atomically precise metal clusters. Due to their defined coordination geometry, in this work, atomically precise Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters are exploited to identify the crucial factor that can impact the catalytic efficiency for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process and further gain valuable insight into the exclusive cooperative effect of the central Pd atom and the peripheral Au atoms of the Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ cluster on controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a heterogeneous catalyst, namely Pd1Au8@Resin, is designed by exchanging positively charged Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the porous resin, thereby not only facilitating catalyst recyclability when performed in a batch reactor, but also realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction carried out in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor. The integrated advantages of homogeneous complexes and heterogeneous catalysts are expected to advance the usability of atomically precise metal clusters as heterogeneous catalysts for important bond constructions in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Aqueous Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Cost Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules trapped in carcerand&#8208;like networks lead to quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes, which are compatible with alkali metals with no gas evolution, high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%, and low cost. This work paves innovative ways for water&#8208;based, low&#8208;cost, sustainable batteries, and beyond.









Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes are highly important for batteries due to their sustainability, greenness, and low cost. However, the free water molecules react violently with alkali metals, rendering the high&#8208;capacity of alkali&#8208;metal anodes unusable. Here, water molecules are confined in a carcerand&#8208;like network to build quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes (QAEs) with reduced water molecules' freedom and matched with the low&#8208;cost chloride salts. The formed QAEs possess substantially different properties than liquid water molecules, including stable operation with alkali&#8208;metal anodes without gas evolution. Specifically, the alkali&#8208;metal anodes can directly cycle in a water&#8208;based environment with suppressed growth of dendrites, electrode dissolution, and polysulfide shuttle. Li&#8208;metal symmetric cells achieved long&#8208;term cycling over 7000&#160;h (and over 5000/4000&#160;h for Na/K symmetric cells), and all the Cu&#8208;based alkali&#8208;metal cells exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Full metal batteries, such as Li||S batteries, attained high Coulombic efficiency, long life (over 4000 cycles), and unprecedented energy density among water&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

Battery Recycling
In article number 2211946, Bartosz A. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers present a one&#8208;pot separation of metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Three liquid layers occupy different segments of the rotating cylindrical vessel and are intensely stirred to move selected components between layers. In only ten minutes, all cobalt and manganese migrate from the feed to the acceptor layer (red), while lithium and nickel remain in the processed feed layer (green).

Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes
In article 2212098, Jaekwang Lee, Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a significant amount of oxygen loss can be induced exclusively by lattice strain even in pristine layered oxides, LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, without any electrochemical Li extraction. Calculations based on density functional theory also clarify that shear strain, among many different modes of mechanical strain, provide a major contribution to the energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, critically supporting the experimental observations.

Blood Glucose Monitoring
In article number 2208820, Qiao Jiang, Baoquan Ding, Yan Wu, Ran Liu, and co&#8208;workers describe a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device for quantitatively monitoring blood glucose. Through collaboratively integrating the advantages of fluorescence imaging, DNA origami, and the microneedle patch, the FAOM device can monitor blood glucose in real&#8208;time in a trivially painful, highly sensitive and accurate manner, thus improving test tolerance and patient compliance.

Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2300002, Yu Li, Chuan Wu, Ying Bai, and co&#8208;workers develop an efficient strategy to reconstruct the surface functionality of hard carbons in situ, which can controllably catalyze preferential salt decomposition to form an inorganic&#8208;rich and layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The structurally stable and ion&#8208;conductive SEI enables advanced hard carbon anodes with an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency and long cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: A Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S deposition, the final discharge step contributing 75% capacity to Li&#8211;S batteries, remains a formidable issue due to its sluggish kinetics. The inferior deposition kinetics stem from the huge interfacial impedances, suggesting its interface&#8208;dominated nature. In this review, the progress and outlook of interface engineering for Li2S deposition, associated with the underlying mechanisms and potential problem&#8208;solving strategies, are reviewed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

         <title>Acoustodynamic Covalent Materials Engineering for the Remote Control of Physical Properties Inside Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on vat photopolymerization 3D printing, the fabrication of dynamic cross&#8208;linked material functionalized with reversibly cleavable covalent bonds upon exposure to light and high&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound is realized. This approach opens a new avenue for developing sustainable new methodologies for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of dynamic cross&#8208;linked materials.








Abstract
Advances in vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing (3DP) technology enable the production of highly precise 3D objects. However, it is a major challenge to create dynamic functionalities and to manipulate the physical properties of the inherently insoluble and infusible cross&#8208;linked material generated from VP&#8208;3DP without reproduction. The fabrication of light&#8208; and high&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)&#8208;responsive cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials linked with hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) in polymer chains based on VP&#8208;3DP is reported here. Although the photochemistry of HABI produces triphenylimidazolyl radicals (TPIRs) during the process of VP&#8208;3DP, the orthogonality of the photochemistry of HABI and photopolymerization enables the introduction of reversible cross&#8208;links derived from HABIs in the resulting 3D&#8208;printed objects. While photostimulation cleaves a covalent bond between two imidazoles in HABI to generate TPIRs only near the surface of the 3D&#8208;printed objects, HIFU triggers cleavage in the interior of materials. In addition, HIFU travels beyond an obstacle to induce a response of HABI&#8208;embedded cross&#8208;linked polymers, which cannot be attainable with photostimulation. The present system would be beneficial for tuning the physical properties and recycling of various polymeric materials, but it will also open the door for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of materials when coupled to various dynamic covalent materials.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Film from Laser Recrystallization in Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The orientation of crystals on the substrate and the presence of defects are critical factors in electro&#8208;optic performance. However, technical approaches to guide the orientational crystallization of electro&#8208;optical thin films remains challenging. This article reports on a novel physical method called magnetic field assisted pulse laser annealing (MAPLA) for controlling the orientation of perovskite crystals on substrates. By inducing laser recrystallization of perovskite crystals under a magnetic field and with magnetic nanoparticles, the optical and magnetic fields w ere found to guide the orientational gathering of perovskite units into nanoclusters, resulting in perovskite crystals with preferred lattice orientation in (110) and (220) perpendicular to the substrate. The perovskite crystals obtained by MAPLA exhibited significantly larger grain size and fewer defects compared to those from pulsed laser annealing (PLA) and traditional thermal annealing, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrated improved device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe2O3 nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improved crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhanced long&#8208;term stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro&#8208;optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Drug Release from a Flexible, Tissue&#8208;Adherent, Hybrid Hydrogel Actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced mechanoresponsive drug delivery is introduced. The HHA consists of a soft actuator with a tough drug&#8208;eluting hydrogel layer that can conformally adhere to wet tissue and locally deliver drug in a spatially targeted manger in response to controlled soft robotic actuation.








Abstract
Soft robotic technologies for therapeutic biomedical applications require conformal and atraumatic tissue coupling that is amenable to dynamic loading for effective drug delivery or tissue stimulation.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced mechanoresponsive drug delivery is introduced. The HHA consists of a soft actuator with a tough drug-eluting hydrogel layer that can conformally adhere to wet tissue and locally deliver drug in a spatially targeted manger in response to controlled soft robotic actuation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft robotic technologies for therapeutic biomedical applications require conformal and atraumatic tissue coupling that is amenable to dynamic loading for effective drug delivery or tissue stimulation. This intimate and sustained contact offers vast therapeutic opportunities for localized drug release. Herein, a new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced drug delivery is introduced. The multi-material soft actuator can elicit a tunable mechanoresponsive release of charged drug from its alginate/acrylamide hydrogel layer with temporal control.

The actuator can safely adhere to tissue via a flexible, drug-permeable adhesive bond that can withstand dynamic device actuation.

Abstract
The discovery of antibiotics has saved millions of lives, but the emergence of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria has become another problem in modern medicine. To avoid or reduce the overuse of antibiotics in antibacterial treatments, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, pathogen&#8208;targeting nanoparticles, immunogenic nano&#8208;toxoids, and biomimetic materials are being developed to make sterilization better and smarter than conventional therapies. The common goal of smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) is to increase the antibiotic efficacy or function via an antibacterial mechanism different from that of antibiotics in order to increase the antibacterial and biological properties while reducing the risk of drug resistance. The research and development of SAMs are increasingly interdisciplinary because new designs require the knowledge of different fields and input/collaboration from scientists in different fields. A good understanding of energy conversion in materials, physiological characteristics in cells and bacteria, and bactericidal structures and components in nature are expected to promote the development of SAMs. In this review, the importance of multidisciplinary insights for SAMs is emphasized, and the latest advances in SAMs are categorized and discussed according to the pertinent disciplines including materials science, physiology, and biomimicry.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near&#8208;Zero Standby Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) fiber strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain&#8208;sensor can be used to implement an ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.








Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive&#8208;fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Material Design Strategies for Recovery of Critical Resources from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recovering critical resources from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater sources can offer a sustainable path toward securing their supply chains. This work reviews the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery.








Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery are reviewed. In addition, a critical perspective is offered on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(Glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Water Harvesting and Concurrent Carbon Capture: A Review for Hygroscopic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hygroscopic materials are a solution to global water shortage. Following the structure&#8211;performance relationship, their current performance and future challenges are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions makes water harvesting and concurrent carbon capture practical. An emphasis is laid on metal&#8211;organic frameworks for their excellent performance in water and CO2 adsorption and representative role of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials.








Abstract
As water scarcity becomes a pending global issue, hygroscopic materials prove a significant solution. Thus, there is a good cause following the structure&#8211;performance relationship to review the recent development of hygroscopic materials&#160;and provide inspirational insight into&#160;creative materials. Herein, traditional hygroscopic materials, crystalline frameworks,&#160;polymers, and composite materials are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions of water harvesting and carbon capture makes simultaneously addressing water shortages and reduction of greenhouse effects possible. Concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture is&#160;likely to become a future challenge. Therefore, an emphasis is laid on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for their excellent performance in water and CO2&#160;adsorption, and representative role of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Herein, the water adsorption mechanisms of MOFs are summarized, followed by a review of MOF's water stability, with a highlight on the emerging machine learning (ML) technique to predict MOF water stability and water uptake. Recent advances in the mechanistic elaboration of moisture's effects on CO2&#160;adsorption are reviewed.&#160;This review summarizes recent advances in water&#8211;harvesting porous materials with special attention on MOFs and expects to direct researchers&#8217; attention into the topic of concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture as a future challenge.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;Rousing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofilm microenvironment responsive self&#8208;assembly copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all&#8208;stage biofilm&#8208;associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converts endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

&lt;p&gt;Biofilm microenvironment responsive self-assembly copper-doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all-stage biofilm-associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis-like death and macrophage re-rousing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial biofilm-associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME-responsive copper-doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu-POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re-rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self-assembly of Cu-POM in BME converts endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu-POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu-POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis-like death. CDT re-rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME-responsive Cu-POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis-like death via metabolic interference, while also re-rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all-stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;responsive actuator with notable deformation, rapid response, and heavy workload is prepared via a swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. Its bending deformation under humidity change can be programmed to mimic the burrowing activities of earthworms, opening a new avenue to expand stimuli&#8208;responsive and degradable polymer materials in the areas associated with agricultural considerations.








Abstract
Natural earthworm with the ability to loosen soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired worldwide interest in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, a degradable actuator with the ability to deform in desired ways is presented, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamide via the swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamide in moisture conditions causes rapid and remarkable bending. Such mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques. The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting rain diffusion as well as root breath.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;Stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;Alloy Acceptors Composed of a Hinge&#8208;Like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hinge&#8208;like dimer acceptor DT19 is designed and synthesized as a special third component. This dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality in synergistically improving device efficiency and thermal stability of relevant host systems.








Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, is successfully designed and synthesized. It is incorporated as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrates a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintains a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#160;&#176;C for 200&#160;h. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperforms ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate Toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid state films, which leads to low charge transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, we report a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy to order the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that were incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals were redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which was found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both PM6 and L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 and 300&#160;nm &#8208;thick photoactive layer respectively.

         <title>Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor Single Crystals with Chiral 2D Supramolecular Organization for Anisotropic Chiral Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;-conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high-performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly. Herein, we show that chiral fused-ring electron acceptor BTP-4F single crystal-based phototransistors demonstrate distinguished CPL discrimination capability with current dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;) exceeding 1.4, one of the highest values among state-of-the-art direct CPL detectors. The theoretical calculations prove that the chirality at the supramolecular level in these enantiomeric single crystals originates from chiral exciton coupling of a unique quasi-two-dimensional supramolecular organization consisting of interlaced molecules with opposite helical conformation. Impressively, such supramolecular organization produces a higher &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; along the preferred growth direction of the chiral single crystals in comparison to that of the short axis direction. Furthermore, the amplified, inverted, and also anisotropic current dissymmetry compared to optical dissymmetry has been studied by the finite element simulations. Therefore, we develop a unique chiral supramolecular organization that is responsible for the excellent chiroptical response and anisotropic electronic properties, which not only enables the construction of high-performance CPL detection devices but also allows a better understanding of the structure-property relationships in chiral organic optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conversion&#8208;type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Non&#8208;Alkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, And Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in non&#8208;alkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of non&#8208;alkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>Enabling Scalable Polymer Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Reinforced Stable Interface for 4.5&#160;V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hitherto, it remains a great challenge to stabilize the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces and impede lithium dendrite proliferation in lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich LiNxCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NCM) layer cathodes. Herein, a special molecular&#8208;level designed polymer electrolyte is prepared by the copolymerization of hexafluorobutyl acrylate and methylene bisacrylamide to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces. Verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, there are favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal anodes and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The SEI enriched in lithiophilic N&#8208;(C)3 guides the homogenous distribution of Li+ and facilitates the transport of Li+ through LiF and Li3N, promoting uniform Li+ plating and stripping. Moreover, the CEI with antioxidative amide groups could suppress the parasitic reactions between cathode and electrolyte and the structural degradation of cathode. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy is utilized, which is quite suited for continuous electrolyte fabrication with environmental friendliness. The fabricated polymer electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve prolonged operation with a retention rate of 85.0% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides new insights into molecular design and processibility design for polymer&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues c ould enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;functional Perovskite&#8208;based Photodetector And Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory, which demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. With the advancement of integrated circuits, the miniaturization and high integration of devices are an inevitable trend. Therefore, the combining of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains a challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, we designed a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realized an ultra&#8208;high self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276 mAW&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#215;1011 Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34 mWcm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8764;100 (&#177; 2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultra&#8208;high on/off ratio (&#8764;105), an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of 3&#215;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000 s) were realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. Our device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provide new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Carrageenan as A Sacrificial Binder for 5&#160;V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
5&#160;V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) with its spinel symmetry is a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high&#8208;voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. Herein, we overcome this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSOxF, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN&#8208;based electrode exhibited cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.

However, the high-voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long-term and high-rate cycling. Herein, we overcome this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;-carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode-electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;F, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN-based electrode exhibited cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells And Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, we present a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities. We demonstrate that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppressed all recombination reactions. We achieve champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retained more than 92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Ii Fluorophore with Inverted Dependence of Fluorescence Quantum Yield on Polarity as Potent Phototheranostics for Fluorescence Image&#8208;Guided Phototherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic phototheranostics simultaneously having fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8722;1700&#160;nm) window, photothermal, and photodynamic functions possess great prospects in tumor diagnosis and therapy. However, such phototheranostics generally suffer from low brightness and poor photodynamic performance due to severe solvatochromism. Herein, an organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore AS1, which possesses an inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity, is reported to serve as potent phototheranostics for tumor diagnosis and therapy. After encapsulation of AS1 into nanostructures, the obtained phototheranostics (AS1R) exhibit high extinction coefficients (e.g., 68200 L mol&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm), NIR&#8208;II emission with high fluorescence quantum yield up to 4.7% beyond 1000&#160;nm, photothermal conversion efficiency of ca. 65%, and 1O2 quantum yield up to 4.1%. The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that AS1R are superior to other types of organic phototheranostics in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration. The excellent phototheranostic performance of AS1R enables clear visualization and complete elimination of tumors using a single and low injection dose. This study demonstrates for the first time the merits and prospects of NIR&#8208;II fluorophore with inverted polarity dependence of fluorescence quantum yield as high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents for fluorescence imaging and phototherapy of tumors.

         <title>Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we develop a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, in response to the tumor microenvironment (TEM)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT), which was enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, the biotuner could effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, our approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <title>Towards Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution Processed Flexible Perovskite Nanocrystal&#8208;Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning from display/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here we report the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystal layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable, and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultra&#8208;flexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultra&#8208;flexibility enabled the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultra&#8208;flexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Tunable Organic Active Neural Probe Enabling Near&#8208;Sensor Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifier is monolithically integrated with organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a highly flexible substrate. The active neural probe records local field potentials in an experimental rat model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This approach creates a new near&#8208;sensor processing paradigm in neural interface technology.








Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers are presented by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. The organic voltage amplifiers are validated as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. These results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Probing Optical Multi&#8208;Level Memory Effects in Single Core&#8208;Shell Quantum Dots And Application Through 2d&#8208;0d Hybrid Inverters</title>

Abstract
Challenges in the development of a multi&#8208;level memory device for multinary arithmetic computers have posed an obstacle to low&#8208;power, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed operation. For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type&#8208;I core/shell quantum dots, we demonstrate a 2D&#8208;0D hybrid optical multi&#8208;level memory device operated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with multi&#8208;level memory characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, we also establish the mechanism of the optical multi&#8208;level memory effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent quantum dots facing a double ZnS shell, which we test by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D&#8208;0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent multi&#8208;level memory characteristics in the 2D&#8208;0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a multi&#8208;level memory inverter to produce multi&#8208;level memory effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system based on the proposed optical multi&#8208;level memory inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR&#8208;10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;structure simulation of methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for identifying promising molecular semiconductors: discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene showing ultrahigh mobility</title>

Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility was not realized in other methylchalocogenated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials.
To realize this, we developed a new computational approach to simulating crystal structures of all methylchalocogenated pyrenes, which was then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) was expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. We thus chose MT&#8208;peropyrene as the synthetic target and developed a new peropyrene synthesis method. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors showed mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior And High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (q2DCPs) are polymers that consist of linear conjugated polymer chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, w e report the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at an air/H2SO4(95%) interface. The unique interfacial environment facilitated chain extension, prevented disorder, and resulted in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus w e investigated the temperature&#8208;dependent charge transport properties of q2DPPy using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method revealed that the q2DPPy film exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS revealed a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8764;107.1 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1.

This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;-electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus w e investigated the temperature-dependent charge transport properties of q2DPPy using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The vdP method revealed that the q2DPPy film exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long-range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz-TDS revealed a band-like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short-range high THz mobility of &#8764;107.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Spectral And Directional Emissivity with Gradient Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero InAs Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Controlling both the spectral bandwidth and directionality of emitted thermal radiation is a fundamental challenge in contemporary photonics. Recent work has shown that materials with a spatial gradient in the frequency range of their epsilon near zero (ENZ) response can support broad spectrum directionality in their emissivity, enabling high total radiance to specific angles of incidence. However, this capability has been limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials with phonon&#8208;polariton resonances over long&#8208;wave infrared wavelengths. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate an approach using doped III&#8208;V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth and directionality of infrared emissivity. We epitaxially grow and characterize InAs&#8208;based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and directional ranges as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness. Due to its easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate geometry we believe this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications in heat transfer and infrared sensing.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Cation&#8208;&#928; Interactions Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Bright And Spectrally Stable Rec. 2020 Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with pure&#8208;red electroluminescence for practical applications remains a critical challenge because of the problematic luminescence property and spectral instability of existing emitters. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs simultaneously exhibiting exceptional brightness and spectral stability based on CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) capping with aromatic amino acid ligands featuring cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. We prove that strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the PbI6&#8208;octahedra of perovskite units and the electron&#8208;rich indole ring of tryptophan (TRP) molecules not only chemically polish the imperfect surface sites and induce crystal reconstruction of the NCs, but also markedly increase the binding affinity of the ligand molecules, leading to high photoluminescence quantum yields and greatly enhanced spectral stability of the CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Moreover, the incorporation of small&#8208;size aromatic TRP ligands ensures superior charge transport properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at around 635&#160;nm demonstrate a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a max luminance of 12,910&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and outstanding spectral stability, representing one of the best&#8208;performing Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs achieved so far.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

         <title>Rational Design of A Chemical Bath Deposition Based Tin Oxide Electron Transport Layer for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemical bath deposition is widely used to deposit SnOx as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnOx particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA has been reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, we&#160;introduced a volatile oxalic acid (OA) as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H2O2 treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H2O2 treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnOx layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss&#8208;spectroscopy) confirms that the SnOx surface is dominated by Sn4+, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn2+ and Sn4+. This rational design of a CBD SnOx layer leads to devices with T85&#8764;1,500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA&#8208;based device with T80&#8764;250&#160;h. Our&#160;champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnOx to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural carriers for intercellular transfer of bioactive molecules, which have been harnessed for wide biomedical applications. However, a facile yet general approach to engineering interspecies EV&#8208;cell communications is still lacking. Here, w e report the use of DNA to encode the heterogeneous interfaces of EVs and cells in a manner free of covalent or genetic modifications, which enables orthogonal EV&#8208;cell interkingdom interactions in complex environments. W e employ cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands and tetrahedral DNA frameworks with complementary sequences to serve as artificial ligands and receptors docking on EVs and living cells, respectively, which can mediate specific yet efficient cellular internalization of EVs via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. W e show that based on this system, human cells can adopt EVs derived from the mouse, watermelon, and E. coli. By implementing several EV&#8208;cell circuits, w e show that this DNA&#8208;programmed system allows orthogonal EV&#8208;cell communications in complex environments. W e further demonstrate efficient delivery of EVs with bioactive contents derived from STO cells toward monkey female germline stem cells (FGSCs), which enables self&#8208;renewal and stemness maintenance of the FGSCs without feeder cells. This system might provide a universal platform to customize intercellular exchanges of materials and signals across species and kingdoms.

         <title>Stabilisation of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with A 2d Dion&#8208;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, we report a surface dimensionality reduction strategy, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8208;Jacobson layer mainly grew at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer. The resulting inorganic perovskite films exhibited excellent humidity resistance when submerged in an aqueous solution (Isopropanol: Water = 4: 1v/v) and exposed to a 50% humidity air atmosphere. The DJ 2D/3D inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with a Voc of 1.197&#160;eV. It retained 83% of initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. Our work demonstrates an effective way for stabilising efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive And Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffold shows promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, we developed a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI. The hydrogel is composed of DOPA&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to the conventional hydrogel, our hydrogel insured as significant promotion of the immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries were enhanced, including motor function, sensory function and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, our proposed hydrogel represented an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembled Bispecific Nano&#8208;Blocker for Enhancing Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T&#8208;cells activation. However, owing to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components induced unsatisfactory T&#8208;cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies makes it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we reported a peptide&#8208;based bispecific nano&#8208;blocker (BNB) strategy for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that capable of boosting up T&#8208;cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the BNB strategy selectively recognize and bond CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self&#8208;assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, BNB exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, i.e., the elimination half&#8208;life (t1/2) of BNB in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h that is about 50&#8208;time longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcomes potential systemic side effect. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T&#8208;cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, our findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T-cells activation. However, owing to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components induced unsatisfactory T-cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies makes it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we reported a peptide-based bispecific nano-blocker (&lt;b&gt;BNB&lt;/b&gt;) strategy for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD-L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that capable of boosting up T-cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T-cells activation by PD-L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high-performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the &lt;b&gt;BNB&lt;/b&gt; strategy selectively recognize and bond CXCR4/PD-L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self-assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, &lt;b&gt;BNB&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, i.e., the elimination half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of &lt;b&gt;BNB&lt;/b&gt; in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h that is about 50-time longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcomes potential systemic side effect. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T-cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, our findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurface Without Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the two&#8208;dimensional nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in three&#8208;dimensional space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the two&#8208;dimensional design. An example of code&#8208;based all optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which could find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release And Uptake Across A Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, we demonstrated the construction of a series of novel metal&#8208;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic and tetratopic ligands respectively, which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsule possess larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. Our method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating Sirna for Enhanced Mrna Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers were copolymerized to form nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as skeleton, and Acrydite&#8208;DNA as initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8764;34&#160;&#176;C), NF swelled to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, NF de&#8208;swelled to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in NF responded to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA were released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulated the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulated the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our nanosystem showed satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. We envision that our DNA&#8208;based nanosystem provides a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, and promotes the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive And Fast Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3d Printing And Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, w e showcase a new manufacturing paradigm to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. Our mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D printed multiscale microstructures as substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt; 60 &#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185 kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultra&#8208;fast response time (&#8764;36 &#956;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. Our unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to the technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

Abstract
Efficient blue phosphors remain as the formidable challenges for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To circumvent this obstacle, a series of Ir(III) based carbene complexes bearing asymmetric di&#8208;N&#8208;aryl 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene chelates, namely, f&#8208;ct6a &#8210; c, were synthesized and their structures and photophysical properties were comprehensively investigated. Moreover, these emitters can undergo interconversion in refluxing 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, catalyzed by a mixture of sodium acetate (NaOAc) and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#183;H2O) without decomposition. All Ir(III) complexes present good photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 83 &#8211; 88%) with peak maximum (max.) at 443 &#8210; 452&#160;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM = 66 &#8211; 73&#160;nm). Among all fabricated OLED devices, f&#8208;ct6b delivered a max. external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage CIE(x,y) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12), whereas the hyper&#8208;OLED device based on f&#8208;ct6a and 5H,9H,11H,15H&#8208;[1,4] benzazaborino [2,3,4&#8208;kl][1,4]benzazaborino[4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;:4,5][1,4]benzazaborino[3,2&#8208;b]phenazaborine&#8208;7,13&#8208;diamine, N7,N7,N13,N13,5,9,11,15&#8208;octaphenyl (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) exhibited max. EQE of 26.2% and CIE(x,y) of (0.12, 0.13). Finally, the corresponding tandem OLED with f&#8208;ct6b as dopant gave a max. luminance of over 10000 cd&#8901;m&#8210;2 and max. EQE of 42.1%, confirming their candidacies for making true&#8208;blue OLEDs.

All Ir(III) complexes present good photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 83 &#8211; 88%) with peak maximum (max.) at 443 &#8210; 452&#160;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM = 66 &#8211; 73&#160;nm). Among all fabricated OLED devices, f-ct6b delivered a max. external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage CIE(x,y) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12), whereas the hyper-OLED device based on f-ct6a and 5H,9H,11H,15H-[1,4] benzazaborino [2,3,4-kl][1,4]benzazaborino[4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;:4,5][1,4]benzazaborino[3,2-b]phenazaborine-7,13-diamine, N7,N7,N13,N13,5,9,11,15-octaphenyl (&#957;-DABNA) exhibited max. EQE of 26.2% and CIE(x,y) of (0.12, 0.13). Finally, the corresponding tandem OLED with f-ct6b as dopant gave a max. luminance of over 10000 cd&#8901;m&#8210;2 and max. EQE of 42.1%, confirming their candidacies for making true-blue OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Intrinsically Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials synergize the advantages of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), narrowband emission and TADF characteristic, which can be fabricated into highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high color purity, directly facing the urgent market strategic demand of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition and 3D displays. In this contribution, based on edge topology molecular engineering (ETME) strategy, a pair of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, has been developed, which merges the intrinsically helical chirality into MR framework. The optimized CP&#8208;OLEDs with emitters (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and the newly developed ambipolar transport host PhCbBCz exhibit pure green emission with sharp peaks of 532&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 37&#160;nm, and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.29, 0.68). Importantly, they achieve remarkable maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.6% and 29.2%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of &#8722;4.37 &#215; 10&#8722;4 and +4.35 &#215; 10&#8722;4 for (P)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and (M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, respectively.

         <title>Broadband Photodetectors and Imagers in Stretchable Electronics Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of optical devices capable of detecting a wide range of wavelengths with stretchable packaging enables internal evaluations for health conditions and abnormalities of targeted living bodies and various objects without experiencing mechanical stress from an arbitrary surface. This review introduces the trends and detailed techniques of materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems.








Abstract
The integration of flexible electronics with optics can help realize a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of a smart society wherein internal evaluations can be easily performed nondestructively from the surface of various objects that is used or encountered in daily lives. Here, organic&#8208;material&#8208;based stretchable optical sensors and imagers that possess both bending capability and rubber&#8208;like elasticity are reviewed. The latest trends in nondestructive evaluation equipment that enable simple on&#8208;site evaluations of health conditions and abnormalities are discussed without subjecting the targeted living bodies and various objects to mechanical stress. Real&#8208;time performance under real&#8208;life conditions is becoming increasingly important for creating smart societies interwoven with optical technologies. In particular, the terahertz (THz)&#8208;wave region offers a substance&#8208; and state&#8208;specific fingerprint spectrum that enables instantaneous analyses. However, to make THz sensors accessible, the following issues must be addressed: broadband and high&#8208;sensitivity at room temperature, stretchability to follow the surface movements of targets, and digital transformation compatibility. The materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems used to overcome these issues are discussed in detail. Ultimately, stretchable optical sensors and imagers with highly sensitive and broadband THz sensors can facilitate the multifaceted on&#8208;site evaluation of solids, liquids, and gases.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Multi&#8208;ion Engineering Strategies Towards High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As alternatives to the batteries with organic electrolytes, the aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studies. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carriers is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, we are the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>Long&#8208;life Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Anode&#8208;Free Battery Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Initially anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with superb energy capabilities of Li metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. We report a Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh kgcell&#8211;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li metal batteries by 22 &#8211; 47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke or fire accidents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially anode-free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges high production feasibility of Li-ion batteries with superb energy capabilities of Li metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero-Li-excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. We report a Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy for realizing long-life quasi-solid-state anode-free batteries. The Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic-organic hybrid solid-state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi-solid-state anode-free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah-scale quasi-solid-state pouch cells, featuring a high-loading LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li metal batteries by 22 &#8211; 47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi-solid-state anode-free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke or fire accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Peptide&#8208;appended Nanosonosensitizers Targeting Tumor Glycolysis for Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy of Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumor</title>

Abstract
Despite recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, challenges have yet to be surmounted to achieve two major goals of magnifying antitumor immunity and remodeling immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a nanosystem (ODM&#8208;R) that integrates oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (ODM) nanosonosensitizers and R7 peptides with tumor metabolism regulation effects is designed and fabricated for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;immunometabolic therapy of spinal&#8208;metastasized tumor. The ODM generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation to implement sonodynamic therapy (SDT), inducing cancer cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The R7 attached on ODM markedly inhibits the uptake of glucose and excretion of lactic acid in cancer cells by perturbing the glycolysis process. The combination of SDT and tumor glycolysis obstruction by ODM&#8208;R guarantees satisfactory efficacy in synergizing with PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate the spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors, achieving concurrent sonodynamic&#8208;triggered immune activation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remodeling. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.

Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here w e report a strategy to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline polyurethane elastomer by photo&#8208;triggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. Trifunctional molecular motor modified with ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with An Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to the excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to the current injection laser diode, but it has not been realized yet. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) which can sustain intensive carrier injection. Here we report CW lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#183;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically&#8208;pumping. Our results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Core Electron Count As A Versatile And Accurate New Descriptor For Sorting Mechanical Properties Of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating improved sorting strategy. Here, we examine elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure, and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8208;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. The unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, VEC&#8208;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases And Hyaluronan Synthase: A Novel Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8211;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, we constructed a dual&#8211;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowered the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8211;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contributed to eliminating ROS/RNS (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;&#8211;2/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, MPMP nanozyme triggered thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promoted the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating of NF&#8211;&#954;B/IL&#8211;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8211;NIR showed HAS&#8211;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (2.00&#8211;fold) and extracellular (3.12&#8211;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8211;NIR demonstrated superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% reduction) and ACAN expression (2.70&#8211;fold increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8211;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8211;related diseases.

         <title>Target Therapy for Buried Interface Enables Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.05% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The buried interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is pivotal for achieving high efficiency and stability. However, it is challenging to study and optimize the buried interface due to its non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we&#160;develop a facile and effective strategy to modify the SnO2/perovskite buried interface by passivating the buried defects in perovskite and modulating carrier dynamics via incorporating formamidine oxalate (FOA) in SnO2 nanoparticles. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show a longitudinal gradient distribution in the SnO2 layer, mainly accumulating at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which enables high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, minimized defects, superior interface contacts, and matched energy levels between perovskite and SnO2. Significantly, FOA can simultaneously reduce the oxygen vacancies and tin interstitial defects on the SnO2 surface and the FA+/Pb2+ associated defects at the perovskite buried interface. Consequently, the FOA treatment significantly improves the efficiency of the PSCs from 22.40% to 25.05% and their storage&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. This method provides an effective target therapy of buried interface in PSCs to achieve very high efficiency and stability.

         <title>UV&#8208;curing&#8208;enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, which luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, we propose a universal strategy to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8208;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing the generation of highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area and &#8220;easy to realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, non&#8208;destructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of safe and high energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, we report the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode. As a result, we have realized Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000 mAh cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8764;6000 mAh cm&#8722;3) and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have developed a series of full cells based on the Ni anode. The designed Ni&#8208;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8208;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200 mAh cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena towards the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy storage devices.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The outstanding electrical and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge optical applications based on TMDs devices. Finally, future directions in the engineering of 2D TMDs for optoelectronics are discussed.

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, here, w e investigate the potential relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and different scanning probe microscopy techniques, w e demonstrate that the polycrystalline material develops charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography measurements, w e find an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Portable Array for Early&#8208;Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer&#8208;precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array here proposed, based on the SiMoT (Single&#8208;Molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;Transistor) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule Limit&#8208;Of&#8208;Identification, LOI (&lt;1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an ELISA&#8208;like 8&#215;12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D&#8208;printed sensing gate cover plate. KRASmut, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts&#8208;fluid from 5&#8211;6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single&#8208;molecule LOI in 1.5 hours. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic&#8208;sensitivity and 100% diagnostic&#8208;specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid&#8208;biopsy&#8208;based early diagnosis of pancreatic&#8208;cancer precursors in plasma.

         <title>AI&#8208;driven Discovery of Amorphous Fluorinated Polymer Electret with Improved Charge Stability for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, we discovered ionization potential as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high&#8208;throughput computations, and graph neural network models, we screened 1,176,591 functional groups on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP) and identified 3 promising electrets. The electrets were synthesized experimentally as 15&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;thick films. The films were able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 hours and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP&#8208;based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret&#8208;based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.

The films were able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 hours and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP-based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret-based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, w e developed a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8208;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends, but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As results, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8208;ITO anodes have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8208;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of approximately 10,000 hours.

         <title>Identifying A Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions (OER) has not been developed. Moreover, a unifying concept has not been established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, we rationally bridge the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over 10 representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides through statistical methodologies. Orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8764;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast And Controlled Capturing, Loading, And Release of Extracellular Vesicles by A Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in many body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and release of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids such as urine and serum. As a proof of principle, the device w as applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it w as found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice w ere enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improved the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and might therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device could greatly facilitate the development of EV&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spins are promising qudits but their weak interaction with external fields makes single&#8208;molecule readout challenging. A solution that exploits chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in photoinduced electron transfer is envisioned in this work. Progress toward the detection of CISS at the molecular level by magnetic resonance is overviewed and it is shown how CISS could enable initialization, manipulation, and readout of molecular spins at high temperature.








Abstract
Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single&#8208;molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single&#8208;spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) enables visualization of oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in ZrO2 nanocrystals. Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among O/M/T phases.








Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. In this work, the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions are directly captured among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8211;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling oncolytic virus delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The virus can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells; then, the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery.








Abstract
Despite the superior tumor lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs&#8216; delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells. Then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Halides&#8208;Enhanced Buried Interfaces for Stable and Extremely Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Deficit Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, facile, and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides is developed for strengthening the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface, in which precise manipulation of perovskite defects and carrier dynamics has been realized by altering halide electronegativity (&#967;).








Abstract
The perovskite buried interfaces have demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs);&#160;however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we proposed a versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2&#160;defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h), and bending test (10&#160;000&#160;times). This method provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces toward high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>An Overstretch Strategy to Double the Designed Elastic Stretchability of Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overstretch strategy is proposed, which is applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to the soft substrate. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching.








Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;are exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional points (EPs) are employed&#160;&#160;in precisely tuning &#160; perovskite lasing actions. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a nanocavity, EPs periodically emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position: both the internal lasing actions and far&#8208;field radiation are completely reversed with a &lt;100 nm displacement. This research may find use in ultrasensitive position sensing.








Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the success of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are not applicable in nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up&#8208;synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here, the physics of exceptional points (EPs) is employed, and a strategy is demonstrated to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, it is shown that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement of &lt;100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities is confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self&#8208;assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.








Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: Adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. This observation is documented quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales, using polarization&#8208;dependent imaging contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and the slight misorientations are consistently between 1&#176; and 40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveal that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when the bicrystals are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight&#8208;misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

         <title>Flexible Solution&#8208;Processable Black&#8208;Phosphorus&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Memristive Synapses for Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Visual Perception Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu/HfOx/solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/Pt structure is designed and fabricated on a flexible Si substrate for neuromorphic computing and artificial visual perception. The device shows advanced synaptic features like long&#8208;term memory, short term memory, short&#8208;term potentiation, and learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when illuminated by visible light. A 6 &#215; 6 optoelectronic synapse array is constructed and used to mimic the human visual perception and visual memory functions.








Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible&#8208;light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible optoelectronic memristor based on a solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, toward biomimetic retinas is presented. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when visible light is induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light&#8208;induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6 synaptic array is developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices are flexed using a silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown.

&lt;p&gt;To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria-specific ATP-binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)-glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt; (1&#8211;4)-glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell-penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non-specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic-acid-modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human-derived multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8211;A&#8208;Type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters toward Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>

A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self&#8208;powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.

This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and makes F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high&#8208;quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to the direct crystallization of (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Solar cells based on (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here, a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to a corner&#8208;sharing structure instead of an edge&#8208;sharing PbI2 octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA+ can replace IPA in situ to form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)&#8208;perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)&#8208;perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multilobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peony&#8208;pollen&#8208;inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti&#8208;inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.








Abstract
Microparticles (MPs)&#8208;based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug&#8208;release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multilobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with a controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity is reported. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with a hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from the zeolite framework by the defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials. The designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory.

&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long-term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy-driven miscibility. In-situ-formed sub-micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high-performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low-temperature post-treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small-size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; printed CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films and devices exhibit superior stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency of All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Long&#8208;Term Stability Enabled by Y6 as a Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6&#8208;processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h.








Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Inorganic Perovskite Surface Reconfiguration for Stable Inverted Solar Cells with 20.38% Efficiency and Its Application in Tandem Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method involves utilizing 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.38% for p&#8211;i&#8211;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs is obtained. Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 25.31%.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have garnered attention in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their suitable bandgap and impressive thermal stability. However, the efficiency of inverted IPSCs has been limited by the high trap density on the top surface of inorganic perovskite film. Herein, a method for fabricating efficient IPSCs by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) is developed. This modification not only exhibits the synergistic coordination of carbonyl (C=O) and amino (NH2) groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, but also the Br fills halide vacancies and suppresses the formation of Pb0, effectively passivating the defective top surface. As a result, a champion efficiency of 20.38%, the highest efficiency reported for inverted IPSCs to date is achieved. Furthermore, the successful fabrication of a p&#8211;i&#8211;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon TSCs with an efficiency of 25.31% for the first time is demonstrated. Crucially, the unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated IPSCs shows enhanced photostability, retaining 80.33% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h, and thermal stability (maintain 85.98% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C). The unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated TSCs also retains 92.59% of its initial efficiency after 200&#160;h under continuous illumination in ambient air.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Bipolar Photoresponse with Amplified Photocurrents in an Electrolyte&#8208;Assisted Bipolar p&#8211;n Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on p&#8211;n junction gallium nitride nanowires with ruthenium oxides surface decoration is built. The device exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.








Abstract
The p&#8211;n junction with bipolar characteristics sets the fundamental unit to build electronics while its unique rectification behavior constrains the degree of carrier tunability for expanded functionalities. Herein, a bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode employed with a gallium nitride (GaN) p&#8211;n homojunction nanowire array that operates in electrolyte is reported, demonstrating bipolar photoresponse controlled by different wavelengths of light. Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulting RuOx/p&#8211;n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of the RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending, which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;channel optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;band signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multifunctional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.

         <title>Microfluidic Templated Stem Cell Spheroid Microneedles for&#160;Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

An in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical transmission electron microscopy characterization platform is first developed by integrating with an ultra&#8208;flexible piezoresistive molybdenum disulfide&#160;micro&#8208;cantilever for device&#8208;level electromechanical and opto&#8208;electromechanical mechanism exploration.








Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#160;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to immature in&#160;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform is put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with optical, mechanical, and electrical coupling fields for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations are implemented by utilizing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#160;nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2&#160;transistors is demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2&#160;nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#160;situ dynamic bending MoS2&#160;nanodevices without/with laser irradiation reveals asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. This approach provides a step toward advanced in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires in&#160;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback and light sensing.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation toward Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt precipitation is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS)&#8211;weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture. As a result, the solvation structure can transform at low temperature by spontaneous increase in entropy of the electrolyte, with a feature of temperature&#8208;adaption. This ensures a fast de&#8208;ionization process and stable co&#8208;intercalation process at low temperature.









Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, this is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which a solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. The results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the concept is further expanded to construct a series of SS&#8211;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ubtle modulation of the coordination environments by introducing P and S heteroatoms, the Ce electroactive sites are modulated to achieve effective enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction's intrinsic catalytic activity. This work supplies significant references for optimizing the electroactivity of atomic catalysts by a coordination regulation strategy.








Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare&#8208;earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, cerium (Ce) SAs supported on a P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are reported. The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possesses a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2&#160;s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for the ORR, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a high and stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of the air cathode, it also displays remarkable performance in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of S and P sites induces significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work offers a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment toward superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

Crystal Misorientation
In article number 2300373, Andrew J. Lew, Davide Ruffoni, Markus J. Buehler, Pupa U. P. A. Gilbert, and co&#8208;workers reveal that the toughness of polycrystalline seashells and coral skeletons is increased by small misorientation of adjacent crystals. The findings pave the way toward bioinspired materials with tunable toughness.

Polarization Order
Polarization&#8208;switching processes of fluorite&#8208;oxide thin films remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions. In article number 2207736, Chen Ge, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, and co&#8208;workers directly capture the transition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2212210, Funan Liu, Hongjun Li, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers present an oncolytic virus therapy that can target metastasis after systemic administration. Tumor cells that have been pre&#8208;infected with an oncolytic virus serve as the delivery vehicle after pathogenicity has been eliminated by liquid nitrogen shock, but their metastasis&#8208;targeting ability is maintained by the integrity of cellular structure and surface protein preservation. This Trojan&#8208;horse&#8208;like method prevents virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and improves tumor&#8208;specific delivery.

Photoelectrodes
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on a p&#8211;n&#8208;junction GaN nanowire array is shown by Haiding Sun and co&#8208;workers in article number 2300911 to exhibit unambiguously bipolar photoresponse with an output of positive and negative photocurrents under illumination of 365 nm and 265 nm light, respectively. Importantly, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such a photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.

Flame Aerosol Synthesis
In article number 2211104, Lutz M&#228;dler and co&#8208;workers report a novel thermochemical process control with coordinated precursor design, which enables the establishment of a reactive spray process that produces binary metal sulfides with high surface area and crystallinity in the gas phase. Thus a breakthrough technology capable of producing multimetal sulfides (ternary, quaternary) is provided, which will play a key role in the field of non&#8208;oxide materials.

Natural materials and derivatives, functionalization techniques of natural materials, and applications to green flexible electronics are presented in detail in sequence. Last, the perspectives on current challenges and opportunities of green flexible electronics based on natural materials are provided.








Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasing to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO2RR/NO3RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.

Inspired by a world entering a quantum age, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop framework is presented, which addresses key challenges and opportunities to overcome in the manufacturing of quantum materials.








Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high-throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; framework for high-throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topology and Symmetry in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

Quantum Applications
In article number 2201064, Ajit K. Roy and co&#8208;workers present a perspective of quantum technology state of the art wherein critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. As represented in the cover, atomic defects are created in a transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) thin film with a specialized tip in an atomic force microscope. AFM tip tracing indicates atomic&#8208;scale localization of materials states at the defect location. These controlled and localized defect sites are the source of quantum signal generation under a biased field.

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;In this article, time-resolved momentum-microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two-dimensional materials in momentum-space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band-structure by Floquet band engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin-physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi-metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out-of-equilibrium, light-induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface-sensitive, time-resolved photoemission-based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi-dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time-resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band-structure and band-topology by laser fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <title>Quantum Sensing of Thermoelectric Power in Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced. The current materials&#8208;related challenges in current quantum devices are identified and how nanoscale and low&#8208;dimensional materials may be used to overcome these challenges is considered. Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.
