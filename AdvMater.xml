         <title>Reconstruction of Thiospinel to Active Sites and Spin Channels for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reconstruction of thiospinel CoFe2S4 evolves both oxyhydroxide species as active site and Fe3S4 component as spin channel, which is unique. The reconstructed CoFe2S4 shows state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxygen evolution reaction activity because of a strong magnetic anisotropy at the interface between oxyhydroxide and Fe3S4 components. The reconstructed configuration also benefits a robust performance in membrane electrolyzers.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low&#8208;cost anode catalysts. Many pre&#8208;catalysts are found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, a study is reported to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre&#8208;catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2S4, and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2S4 gives a mixture with both Fe&#8211;S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)OxHy) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe&#8211;S component in a major form of Fe3S4. The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)OxHy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O&#8211;O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the precatalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni Alloy Polyhedral Nanochains as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni nanostructures, consisting of ordered nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowires&#8211;nanopolyhedra, are designed and prepared for efficient dual&#8208;function application in direct methanol fuel cells. The nanostructure enjoys the advantages of both the optimal catalytic activity of 0D nanopolyhedra and the robust catalytic stability of 1D nanowires, and also compensates for the nonuniformity of catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by the size effect.








Abstract
Pt nanocatalysts play a critical role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) due to their appropriate adsorption/desorption energy, yet suffer from an unbalanced relationship between size&#8208;dependent activity and stability. Herein, mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni alloy polyhedral nanochains (Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs) with an ordered assembly of a nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowire&#8211;nanopolyhedra architecture are fabricated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for DMFCs, effectively alleviating the size effect. The Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs exhibit 7.23 times higher mass activity for the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of commercial Pt/C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CO stripping measurements demonstrate the prominent stability of the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs to resist CO poisoning. For the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a positive half&#8208;wave potential exceeding Pt/C is achieved by the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs, and it can be well maintained for 10&#160;000 cycles with negligible activity decay. The designed nanostructure can alleviate the agglomeration and dissolution problems of 0D small&#8208;sized Pt&#8211;Ni alloy nanocrystals and enrich surface atom steps and active facets of 1D chain&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a proposed strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts by constructing novel interfacial relationships in mixed dimensions to alleviate the imbalance between catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by size effects.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8211;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model is constructed to describe the crystallization process of the perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). Furtherly, a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy is designed to optimize the D&#8211;C model for high&#8208;quality PNCs. Finally, the green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the PNCs achieved EQE of 22.5%.








Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in situ characterization of the PNCs, it is revealed that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On this basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, the work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Tuning the C1/C2 Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8208;CeO2 Nanorods by Oxidation State Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ceria (CeO2) is one of the most extensively used rare earth oxides. Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalsts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO2 interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, we present a Cu&#8208;CeO2 nanorod (Cu&#8208;CeO2 NR) selective electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst having a well&#8208;controlled Cu&#8208;CeO2 interface. Using in operando analysis and computational techniques, we found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix. In this window, Cu undergoes a transition from the thermodynamically less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C&#8208;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu&#8208;ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27&#8208;times that of a corresponding Cu&#8208;carbon catalyst under the same conditions.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nano Roads Promotes Selective C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction During Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Obtaining multicarbon products via CO2 photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron mediated C&#8208;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2 conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centres having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#8208;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, we present a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, which selectively converts CO2 to a C2 product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through Transmission Electron Microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the presence of charge polarized bismuth centres in Bi19S27Cl3, which is well complemented by DFT calculation. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centres renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centres yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#8208;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates was experimentally mapped by in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

         <title>Single Zinc Atom Aggregates: Synergetic Interaction to Boost Fast Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur electrodes arising from polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics due to their excellent applicability in atomic&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, nitrogen (N)&#8208;anchored SACs on the highly ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays were reported as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cube structure of the aligned carbon nanotubes can promote the rapid mass transfer under high sulfur loadings, and abundant single&#8208;atom active sites further accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms with interatomic distances less than 1&#160;nm further accelerates the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. As a result, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibited outstanding cycle stability with a high areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 7.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (electrolyte to sulfur ratio is about 3.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1). Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivered a high capacity of 953.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Orbital Hybridization&#8208;Driven Charge Density Wave Transition in CsV3Sb5 Kagome Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to its inherent non&#8208;trivial geometry, the unique structural motif of the recently discovered Kagome topological superconductor AV3Sb5 (A&#8201; = &#8201;K, Rb, Cs) is an ideal host of diverse topologically non&#8208;trivial phenomena, including giant anomalous Hall conductivity, topological charge order, charge density wave (CDW), and unconventional superconductivity. Despite possessing a normal&#8208;state CDW order in the form of topological chiral charge order and diverse superconducting gaps structures, it remains unclear how fundamental atomic&#8208;level properties and many&#8208;body effects including Fermi surface nesting, electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and orbital hybridization contribute to these symmetry&#8208;breaking phenomena. Here, we report the direct participation of the V3d&#8212;Sb5p orbital hybridization in mediating the CDW phase transition in CsV3Sb5. The combination of temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray absorption and first&#8208;principles studies clearly indicate the Inverse Star of David structure as the preferred reconstruction in the low&#8208;temperature CDW phase. Our results highlight the critical role that Sb orbitals plays and establish orbital hybridization as the direct mediator of the CDW states and structural transition dynamics in Kagome unconventional superconductors. This is a significant step towards the fundamental understanding and control of the emerging correlated phases from the Kagome lattice through the orbital interactions and provide promising approaches to novel regimes in unconventional orders and topology.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Programming of Fibroblasts into Neurons via a Scalable Magnetoelastic Generator Array</title>

Abstract
Developing scalable electrical stimulating platforms for cell and tissue engineering applications is limited by external power source dependency, wetting resistance, microscale size requirements, and suitable flexibility. Here, we developed a versatile and scalable platform that enables tunable electrical stimulation for biological applications by harnessing the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems to convert gentle air pressure (100 &#8211; 400&#160;kPa) and yield current values of up to 10.5&#160;mA and 9.5&#160;mV. The platform is shown to be easily manufactured and scaled up for integration in multi&#8208;well magnetoelastic plates via three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. We demonstrated that the electrical stimulation generated by this platform enhanced the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device has broad applications in high throughput organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems and paves the way for future development of neural engineering, including cellular therapy via implantable self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation devices.

         <title>Dynamic Epitaxial Growth of Organic Heterostructures for Polarized Exciton Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the location of the dynamic epitaxial growth, a stepwise seeded growth approach is demonstrated for the organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures with a hierarchical spatial organization, such as triblock, core/shell, and axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. Moreover, these prepared organic heterostructures can be used in the micro/nanoscale multiple in/output optical logic gates.








Abstract
Highly spatial and angular precision in epitaxial&#8208;growth process is crucial for constructing organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures (OLDHs) with the desired substructures, which remains significant challenge owing to the unpredicted location of complex heterogeneous nucleation. Herein, a dynamic epitaxial&#8208;growth approach is developed along the tailored longitudinal/horizontal directions to create diverse OLDHs with hierarchical architectures. The controlled morphology evolution of seed crystals from kinetic to thermodynamic species is achieved via incrementally increasing the crystallization time from 0 to 600&#160;s. Accordingly, the kinetic and thermodynamic seed crystals respectively present the specific lattice&#8208;matching crystal&#8208;planes of (100) and (011), which facilitates the longitudinal epitaxial&#8208;growth (LG) process for triblock heterostructures, and the horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth (HG) process for axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. The dominant core/shell heterostructures are prepared via both LG and HG processes with a crystallization time of &#8776;30&#160;s. Significantly, these prepared OLDHs realize the rationally polarized exciton conversion for optical logic gate application through the exciton conversion and photon propagation at the heterojunction. This strategy provides an avenue for the precise synthesis of OLDHs with anisotropy optical characters for integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability: Interfacial Passivation of Crosslinked Fullerene Eliminates the &#8220;Burn&#8208;in&#8221; Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li+ ion migration induced &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells is reported. To block the Li+ ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer is introduced on top of the SnO2 layer, resulting in Li+ immobilization. Finally, the efficiency and stability are significantly improved.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) longevity is nowadays the bottleneck for their full commercial exploitation. Although lot of research is ongoing, the initial decay of the output power &#8211; an effect known as &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation happening in the first 100&#160;h &#8211; is still unavoidable, significantly reducing the overall performance (typically of &gt;20%). In this paper, the origin of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs is demonstrated that is directly related to Li+ ions migration coming from the SnO2 electron transporting layer visualized by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) measurements. To block the ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer on top of the SnO2 layer is introduced, resulting in Li+ immobilization. This results in the elimination of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation, showing for the first time a zero &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; loss in the performances while boosting device power conversion efficiency to &gt;22% for triple&#8208;cation&#8208;based PSCs and &gt;24% for formamidinium&#8208;based (FAPbI3) PSCs, proving the general validity of this approach and creating a new framework for the realization of stable PSCs devices.

         <title>Heterogeneous Strain Distribution Based Programmable Gated Microchannel for Ultrasensitive and Stable Strain Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ion channels in living organisms, discretely distributed laterally free micropillars are introduced into the fluidic channel to act as the gates and construct a gated strain sensor with the conductive liquid infiltrated within the gaps, obtaining a high gauge factor of up to 45&#8201;300, wide broad range of 590%, and great stability of 90&#8201;000&#160;drift&#8208;free cycling tests.








Abstract
Developing highly sensitive strain sensors requires conduction pathways capable of rapidly switching between disconnection and reconnection in response to strain. Ion channels in living organisms exactly control the channel switch through protein&#8208;composed gates, achieving changeable ion currents. Herein, inspired by the gating characteristics of the ion channels, a programmable fluidic strain sensor enhanced by gating ion pathways through heterogeneous strain distribution of discrete micropillars is proposed. During stretching, the contraction and closure of the widthwise gaps between discrete micropillars greatly weaken or even nearly cut off the conduction pathway, resulting in orders of magnitude increase in resistance and thus ultrahigh sensitivity. By adjusting the combination form and structural parameters of the discrete micropillars in the fluidic channel, the sensitivity and strain range can be customized. Thus, a gauge factor&#160;of up to 45&#160;300&#160;and a stretch range of 590% are obtained. Benefiting from the fluidic gating mechanism, no mechanical mismatch can be observed at the interface, breaking through the sensing stability issue of flexible sensors. The proposed sensor can be used to detect the full range of human motion, and integrated into a data glove to achieve human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>A Totipotent &#8220;All&#8208;In&#8208;One&#8221; Peptide Sequentially Blocks Immune Checkpoint and Reverses the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide can transform into &#945;&#8208;helix in response to the tumor microenvironment. It possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade combined with reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can dramatically enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which can be achieved by using multiple&#8208;agent therapy. However, the optimal dose and order of administration of different agents remain elusive. To address this dilemma, multiple agents are often grafted together to construct &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; totipotent drugs, but this usually comes at the cost of a lack of synergy between the agents. Herein, by comprehensively analyzing the conserved sites of the immune checkpoint and TME drug targets, peptide secondary structures, assembly properties, and other physicochemical properties, a high&#8208;content peptide library is designed. By using the &#8220;3D&#8208;molecular&#8208;evolution&#8221; screening strategy, an efficient and totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide (TAP) is obtained, which possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53. It is shown that in mice treated with TAP, with either subcutaneous tumors or patient&#8208;derived xenografts, PD&#8208;L1&#160;is blocked, with increased activation of both T and NK cells whilst reversing the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, TAP can mitigate tumor activity and suppress tumor growth, showing superior therapeutic effect over antibody&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Locking Active Li Metal through Localized Redistribution of Fluoride Enabling Stable Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LiF&#8208;rich interphase is constructed via a LiF dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, which is conceptually different from mainstream methods. The overall protective LiF&#8208;rich interphase endows the metallic Li electrode with significantly improved anticorrosive properties against electrolytes under various test conditions and enables stable Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The creation of fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li&#8208;metal anodes for rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering, a Li&#8208;metal composite design is reported in which LiF can locally redistribute on the Li&#8208;metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li22Sn5/LiF ternary composite is investigated, where the as&#8208;formed LiF&#8208;rich SEI locks the active Li metal from corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li22Sn5/LiF anode displays an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (ACE, &#8776;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Applied to a LiCoO2 full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, a high capacity retention of &#8776;91.1% is realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte additive and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Rational Screening of Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Zn for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration about solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on Zn anodes is based on trial and error, which is laborious, inefficient, and missing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art candidates. In this work, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property. As an output, Zn3(BO3)2 is reported as the SEI on Zn anode.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials are explored as SEIs by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn3(BO3)2 (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO2 shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8776;406 mAh cm&#8722;2) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio, N/P ratio = 2.3), and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.

         <title>Flash recycling of graphite anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing production of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life. A closed&#8208;loop solution, with effective recycling of spent LIBs, will lessen both the environmental impacts and economic cost of their use. Presently, &lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery&#8208;grade graphite. Here, we develop an ultrafast flash recycling method to regenerate the graphite anode and recover valuable battery metal resources.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-increasing production of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life. A closed-loop solution, with effective recycling of spent LIBs, will lessen both the environmental impacts and economic cost of their use. Presently, &amp;lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery-grade graphite. Here, we develop an ultrafast flash recycling method to regenerate the graphite anode and recover valuable battery metal resources. Selective Joule heating is applied for only seconds to efficiently decompose the resistive impurities. The generated inorganic salts, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, can be easily recollected from the flashed anode waste using diluted acid, specifically 0.1&#160;M HCl. The flash-recycled anode preserves the graphite structure and is coated with a solid-electrolyte-interphase-derived carbon shell, contributing to high initial specific capacity, superior rate performance and cycling stability, when compared to anode materials recycled using a high-temperature-calcination method. Life-cycle-analysis relative to current graphite production and recycling methods indicate that flash recycling can significantly reduce the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission while turning anode recycling into an economically advantageous process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tube&#8208;Sponge&#8208;Inspired hierarchical electrocatalysts with boosted mass and electron transfer for efficient oxygen evolution</title>

Abstract
Hindered gas bubble release and limited electron conducting process represent the major bottlenecks for large scale electrochemical water splitting. Both the desorption of bubbles and continuous electron transport are achievable on the surfaces of biomimetic catalytic materials by designing multiscale structural hierarchy. Inspired by the tubular structures of the deep&#8208;sea&#160;sponges, we fabricated an exceptionally active and binder&#8208;free porous nickel tube arrays (PNTA) decorated with NiFe&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;pore nanosheets (NiFe&#8208;PZn). The PNTA facilitated removal of bubbles and electron transfer in oxygen evolution reaction by reproducing trunks of the sponges, and simultaneously, the NiFe&#8208;PZn increase the number of catalytic active sites by simulating the sponge epidermis. With improved external mass transfer and interior electron transfer, the hierarchical NiFe&#8208;PZn@PNTA electrode exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10 mA&#8729;cm&#8722;2 (with a Tafel slope of 50 mV&#8729;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, this electrocatalytic system recorded excellent reaction stability over 360 hours with constant current density of 100 mA&#8729;cm&#8722;2 at the potential of 1.52&#160;V (versus RHE). This work provides a new strategy of designing hierarchical electrocatalysts for highly efficient water splitting.

         <title>Stable cuprous hydroxide nanostructures by organic Ligand functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper compounds have been extensively investigated for diverse applications. However, studies of cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) have been scarce, due to structural metastability. Herein, a facile, wet&#8208;chemistry procedure is reported for the preparation of stable CuOH nanostructures via deliberate functionalization with select organic ligands, such as acetylene and mercapto derivatives. The resulting nanostructures are found to exhibit a nanoribbon morphology consisting of small nanocrystals embedded within a largely amorphous nanosheet&#8208;like scaffold. The acetylene derivatives are found to anchor onto the CuOH forming Cu&#8208;C&#2301; linkages, whereas Cu&#8208;S&#8208; interfacial bonds are formed with the mercapto ligands. Effective electronic coupling occurs at the ligand&#8208;core interface in the former, in contrast to mostly non&#8208;conjugated interfacial bonds in the latter, as manifested in spectroscopic measurements and confirmed in theoretical studies based on first principles calculations. Notably, the acetylene&#8208;capped CuOH nanostructures exhibit markedly enhanced photodynamic activity in the inhibition of bacteria growth, as compared to the mercapto&#8208;capped counterparts, due to a reduced material bandgap and effective photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Results from this study demonstrate that deliberate structural engineering with select organic ligands is an effective strategy in the stabilization and functionalization of CuOH nanostructures, a critical first step in exploring their diverse applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the ampltiude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, we report the modulation of the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal via ferroelectric domain patterning, and demonstrate that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The coupling between the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which has been modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. Our study provides a new material platform that enables reconfiguratable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulator, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Improved Molecular Ordering in a Ternary Blend Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) show great commercialization prospects, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still fall behind their small molecule acceptor&#8208;based counterparts. In all&#8208;polymer blends, the optimized morphology and high molecular ordering are difficult to achieve since there is trouble&#8208;some competition between the crystallinity of the polymer donor and acceptor during the film&#8208;formation process. Therefore, it is challenging to improve the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;PSCs. We herein adopt a ternary strategy to modulate the morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend, in which PM6:PY&#8208;82 was selected as the host blend and PY&#8208;DT was employed as a guest component. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary matrix features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering. As a result, the champion PM6:PY&#8208;82:PY&#8208;DT device produces a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.03%, with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor in comparison with the binary devices. High&#8208;performance large&#8208;area (1 cm2) and thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) all&#8208;PSCs were also successfully fabricated with PCEs of 16.35% and 15.70%, respectively. More importantly, 16.5 cm2 organic solar module affords an encouraging PCE of 13.84% when using the non&#8208;halogenated solvent (o&#8208;xylene), showing the great potential of &#8220;Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab&#8221; transition of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Cost&#8208;Effective Polymeric&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Based Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Linear Polarizers with Tailored Fabry &#8211; P&#233;rot Resonance</title>

Abstract
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur has received considerable attention for application in waste&#8208;based infrared (IR) polarizers with high polarization sensitivities, owing to its high transmittance in the IR region and thermal processability. However, there have been few reports on highly sensitive polymeric sulfur&#8208;based polarizers by replication of pre&#8208;simulated dimensions to achieve a high transmission of the transverse magnetic field (TTM) and extinction ratio (ER). Herein, we introduce a 400&#8208;nanometer&#8208;pitch mid&#8208;wavelength infrared bilayer linear polarizer with self&#8208;aligned metal gratings on polymeric sulfur gratings integrated with a spacer layer (SM&#8208;polarizer). The dimensions of the SM&#8208;polarizer can be closely replicated using pre&#8208;simulated dimensions via a systematic investigation of thermal nanoimprinting conditions. Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin&#8208;coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize TTM in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM&#8208;polarizer yields TTM of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ERs of 3.12 &#215; 103, 5.19 &#215; 103, and 5.81 &#215; 103 at 4&#160;&#956;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective SM&#8208;polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.

Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin-coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize T&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM-polarizer yields T&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ERs of 3.12 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 5.19 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 5.81 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 4&#160;&#956;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost-effective SM-polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.








Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Skyrmions Under Control&#8212;FIB Irradiation as a Versatile Tool for Skyrmion Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel way to guide the motion and control the nucleation of skyrmions, magnetic bubbles envisioned for next&#8208;generation spintronic data storage and computation, by means of local ion irradiation, is presented. It is shown that ion irradiation with an optimized dose can create repulsive barriers and even nucleation centers for skyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic data storage and processing offer certain advances over conventional technologies, amongst which nonvolatility and low power operation are the most outstanding ones. Skyrmions are a promising candidate as a magnetic data carrier. However, the sputtering of skyrmion films and the control of the skyrmion nucleation, motion, and annihilation remains challenging. This work demonstrates&#160;that using optimized focused ion beam irradiation and annealing protocols enables the skyrmion phase in W/CoFeB/MgO thin films to be accessed easily. By analyzing ion&#8208;beam&#8208;engineered skyrmion hosting wires, excited by sub&#8208;100 ns current pulses, possibilities to control skyrmion nucleation, guide their motion, and control their annihilation unfold. Overall, the key elements needed to develop extensive skyrmion networks are presented.

         <title>Tuning surface acidity of mixed conducting electrodes: Recovery of Si&#8208;induced degradation of oxygen exchange rate and area specific resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal oxides are an important class of functional materials, and for many applications, ranging from solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells, oxygen permeation membranes, and oxygen storage materials to gas sensors (semiconducting and electrolytic) and catalysts, the interaction between the surface and oxygen in the gas phase is central. Ubiquitous Si&#8208;impurities are known to impede this interaction, commonly attributed to the formation of glassy blocking layers on the surface. Here, we examine the surface oxygen exchange coefficient (kchem) of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2&#8208;&#948; (PCO), a model mixed ionic electronic conductor, via electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and the area&#8208;specific resistance (ASR) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We demonstrate that even low silica levels, introduced by infiltration, depress kchem by a factor 4,000, while the ASR increases 40&#8208;fold and attribute this to its acidity relative to that of PCO. We further show the ability to fully regenerate the poisoned surface by the subsequent addition of basic Ca&#8208; or Li&#8208;species. This ability to not only recover Si&#8208;poisoned surfaces by tuning the relative surface acidity of an oxide surface, but subsequently outperform the pre&#8208;poisoned response, promises to extend the operating life of materials and devices for which the catalytic oxygen/solid interface reaction is central.

         <title>Curvature in Biological Systems: Its quantification, Emergence and Implications Across the Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface curvature both emerges from, and influences the behavior of, living objects at length scales ranging from cell&#160;membranes to single cells to tissues and organs. The relevance of surface curvature in biology has been supported by numerous recent experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years. In this review, we first give a brief introduction to the key ideas of surface curvature in the context of biological systems and discuss the challenges that arise when measuring surface curvature. Giving an overview of the emergence of curvature in biological systems, its significance at different length scales becomes apparent. On the other hand, summarizing current findings also shows that both single cells and entire cell sheets, tissues or organisms respond to curvature by modulating their shape and their migration behavior. Finally, we address the interplay between the distribution of morphogens or micro&#8208;organisms and the emergence of curvature across length scales with examples demonstrating these key mechanistic principles of morphogenesis. Overall, this review highlights that curved interfaces are not merely a passive by&#8208;product of the chemical, biological and mechanical processes but that curvature acts also as a signal that co&#8208;determines these processes.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, w e enhance the charge transfer kinetics of LLO by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly crosslinked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio&#8208;medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of four&#8208;dimensional (4D) printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the three&#8208;dimensional geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D&#8208;printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties. In this paper, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends towards the 4D printing of LCEs are discussed, which might shed light on future research directions in this new field.

         <title>Transition Metal Ion Doping on ZIF&#8208;8 for Enhanced the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to diverse value&#8208;added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) containing various transition metal ions&#8212;Ni, Fe, and Cu&#8212;at varying concentrations upon doping were fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance were scrutinized via X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF&#8208;8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF&#8208;8 achieved a high partial current density of 11.57&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6&#160;h. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atom facilitated COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF&#8208;8, leading to a local effect between the Zn&#8211;N4 and Cu&#8211;N4 moieties. Additionally, advanced CO2RR pathway was illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre&#8208;H&#8208;covered state under the CO2RR. Our findings expand the pool of efficient MOF&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling in Atomically Thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) multiferroics with magnetoelectric coupling combine the magnetic order and electric polarization in a single phase, provide a cornerstone for constructing high&#8208;density information storages and low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption spintronic devices. The strong interactions between various order parameters are crucial for realizing such multifunctional applications, nevertheless, this criterion is rarely met in classical 2D materials at room&#8208;temperature. Here we design an ingenious space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize atomically thin non&#8208;layered &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic order. Interestingly, the strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are unambiguously discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. More significantly, the robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of the controllable synthesis of 2D multiferroics with robust magnetoelectric coupling, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical applications in low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption electric&#8208;writing/magnetic&#8208;reading devices.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials has been sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we demonstrate a versatile strategy of quenching, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In&#8208;situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8722;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability, and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. We also demonstrate the feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Electron&#8211;Phonon Coupling Suppression by Enhanced Lattice Rigidity in 2D Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite single crystals (PSCs) usually demonstrate better X&#8208;ray detection performance than Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) PSCs. However, the mechanism of the improved performance is still elusive. Here, by the aid of strong interactions between dimethylbiguanide (DGA) and PbI2, we design a novel DJ&#8208;perovskitoid (DGA)PbI4. From the comparison of (DGA)PbI4 to other 2D PSCs, we discovered that the tiniest lattice distortion and increased hydrogen bonds in the atom&#8208;scaled analysis strengthen lattice rigidity and weaken electron&#8208;phonon coupling to suppress disordered scattering of carriers, resulting in significantly improved carrier transport and stability. Therefore, high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1) and a pronounced sensitivity of 4869.0 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 are achieved using (DGA)PbI4, which are the best in 2D Pb&#8208;based PSC devices to date. Finally, the (DGA)PbI4 devices exhibit good spatial&#8208;resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging and excellent long&#8208;term stability to work as a promising candidate for medical diagnostics and nondestructive determination.

         <title>3D Bioelectronics with a Remodellable Matrix for Long&#8208;term Tissue Integration and Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioelectronics hold the key for understanding and treating disease. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;term interfaces between electronics and the body remains a challenge. Implantation of a bioelectronic device typically initiates a foreign body response, which can limit long&#8208;term recording and stimulation efficacy. Techniques from regenerative medicine have shown a high propensity for promoting integration of implants with surrounding tissue, but these implants lack the capabilities for the sophisticated recording and actuation afforded by electronics. Combining these two fields can achieve the best of both worlds. Here, we show the construction of a hybrid implant system for creating long&#8208;term interfaces with tissue. We create implants by combining a microelectrode array with a bioresorbable and remodellable gel. These implants are shown to produce a minimal foreign body response when placed into musculature, allowing us to record long&#8208;term electromyographic signals with high spatial resolution. This device platform drives the possibility for a new generation of implantable electronics for long&#8208;term interfacing.

         <title>Melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomer scaffolds with programmed mechanical response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, significant advances have been achieved to precisely program the response of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) through extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing techniques; however, important challenges remain, especially when well&#8208;defined scaffolds based on ultrafine fibers are required. Here we present the melt electrowriting of reactive liquid crystalline inks leading, after UV&#8208;light&#8208;induced crosslinking, to digitally positioned uniform LCE fibers with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers, hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. The electrowriting process induces the preferential alignment of the mesogens parallel to the fiber's axis. Such an alignment, defined by the printing path, determines the mechanical response of the crosslinked material upon stimulation. Our manufacturing platform allows the preparation of open square lattice scaffolds with ultrafine fibers (few micrometers in diameter), periods as small as 90&#160;&#956;m, and well&#8208;defined morphology. Additionally, the combination of accurate fiber stacking (up to 50 layers) and fiber fusion between layers has led to unprecedented microstructures composed of high aspect&#8208;ratio LCE thin walls. The possibility of digitally controlling the printing of fibers allows us to prepare complex fiber&#8208;based scaffolds with programmed and reversible shape&#8208;morphing, thus opening new avenues to prepare miniaturized actuators and smart structures for soft robotics and biomedical applications.

         <title>Physical Origin of Negative Differential Resistance in V3O5 and Its Application as a Solid&#8208;state Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8208;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy&#8208;efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware&#8208;based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here we report the structural, electrical and thermal properties of V3O5 thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;metal relaxation oscillators. The V3O5 devices show electroforming&#8208;free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&lt;3% variation) cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in&#8208;situ thermal imaging and device modelling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self&#8208;confinement of the current distribution, and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the IMT temperature where it is dominated by the temperature dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, we report the dynamics of individual and coupled V3O5&#8208;based relaxation oscillators, and show that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non&#8208;linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronisation. These results establish V3O5 as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid&#8208;state neurons for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Engineering Stable Lead&#8208;free Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Lessons from Materials Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Substituting toxic lead with tin (Sn) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the most promising route towards the development of high&#8208;efficiency lead&#8208;free devices. Despite the encouraging efficiencies of Sn&#8208;PSCs, they are still yet to surpass 15% and suffer detrimental oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Since their first application in 2014, many investigations into the properties of Sn&#8208;PSCs have contributed to a growing understanding of the mechanisms, both detrimental and complementary to their stability. This review summarizes the evolution of Sn&#8208;PSCs, including early developments to the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches used to benefit the stability of devices. We first outline the degradation pathways associated with Sn&#8208;PSCs, followed by describing how composition engineering (A, B site modifications), additive engineering (oxidation prevention), and interface engineering (passivation strategies) can be employed as different avenues to improve the stability of devices. The knowledge about these properties is also not limited to PSCs and also applicable to other types of devices now employing Sn&#8208;based perovskite absorber layers. A detailed analysis of the properties and materials chemistry reveals a clear set of design rules for the development of stable Sn&#8208;PSCs. Applying the design strategies highlighted in this review will be essential to further improve both the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Assisted Sulfonated Covalent Organic Nanosheets: Extrinsic Charge for Improved Ion Transport and Salinity&#8208;Gradient Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is the vital property of nanofluidic channels for salinity&#8208;gradient energy harvesting and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies. Two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic channels constructed by nanosheets exhibit great superiority in ion selectivity, but a high ion transport rate remains challenging due to the insufficiency of intrinsic surface charge density in nanoconfinement. Herein, we demonstrate extrinsic surface charge into nanofluidic channels composed of surfactant&#8208;assisted sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs), which enable tunable ion transport behaviors. The polar moiety of surfactant is embedded in SCONs to adjust in&#8208;plane surface charges, and the aggregation of non&#8208;polar moiety results in the sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel transformation of SCON solution for membrane fabrication. The combination endows SCON/surfactant membranes with considerable water&#8208;resistance, and the designable extrinsic charges promise fast ion transport and high ion selectivity. Additionally, the SCON/surfactant membrane, serving as a power generator, exhibits huge potential in harvesting salinity&#8208;gradient energy where corresponding output power density can reach up to 9.08&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient (0.5&#160;M NaCl|0.01&#160;M NaCl). The approach to extrinsic surface charge provides new and promising insight into regulating ion transport behaviors.

Additionally, the SCON/surfactant membrane, serving as a power generator, exhibits huge potential in harvesting salinity-gradient energy where corresponding output power density can reach up to 9.08&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a 50-fold salinity gradient (0.5&#160;M NaCl|0.01&#160;M NaCl). The approach to extrinsic surface charge provides new and promising insight into regulating ion transport behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Acoustic Crystallization of 2D Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D colloidal self&#8208;assembly provides a simple strategy to produce functional nanostructure arrays. Regularity of the formed 2D crystal is essential to ensure functionality, but can be difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. The acoustic crystallization of 2D crystals process provides a simple methodology to anneal interfacial colloidal monolayers by periodic extension of the interfacial area, creating long&#8208;range order over macroscopic dimensions.








Abstract
2D colloidal crystallization provides a simple strategy to produce defined nanostructure arrays over macroscopic areas. Regularity and long&#8208;range order of such crystals is essential to ensure functionality, but difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. Here, a simple loudspeaker setup for the acoustic crystallization of 2D colloidal crystals (ACDC) of polystyrene, microgels, and core&#8211;shell particles at liquid interfaces is introduced. This setup anneals an interfacial colloidal monolayer and affords an increase in average grain size by almost two orders of magnitude. The order is characterized via the structural color of the colloidal crystal, the acoustic annealing process is optimized via the frequency and the amplitude of the applied sound wave, and its efficiency is rationalized via the surface coverage&#8208;dependent interactions within the interfacial colloidal monolayer. Computer simulations show that multiple rearrangement mechanisms at different length scales, from the local motion around voids to grain boundary movements via consecutive particle rotations around common centers, collude to remove defects. The experimentally simple ACDC process, paired with the demonstrated applicability toward complex particle systems, provides access to highly defined nanostructure arrays for a wide range of research communities.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Functionalized Nanocomposite Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Strong Alkaline&#8208;Tolerance and High Zinc Anode Stability for Ultralong&#8208;Life Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
Increasing pursuit of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics has put forward the demand of reliable energy devices with high flexibility, durability and enhanced electrochemical performances. Flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (FAZABs) have attracted great interests owing to the high energy density, safety, and environmental benignity, for which quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, flexibility and resistance to leakage problems of traditional liquid electrolytes. Compared to commonly used PVA&#8211;KOH electrolyte with poor electrolyte retention capability and cycling stability, a new type of sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE is applied in FAZABs with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance and high zinc anode stability. Notably, the existence of (1) strong anionic sulfonate groups of QSGPEs, contributing to the exposure of preferred Zn (002) plane which is more resistant to zinc dendrite formation, and (2) nano&#8208;attapulgite electrolyte additives, beneficial for the enhancement of ionic conductivity, electrolyte uptake and retention capability, endows a ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h for the fabricated FAZAB. Furthermore, flexible energy belts and knittable energy wires fabricated with a series/parallel unit of several FAZABs could be used to power various wearable electronics.

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

         <title>Fast, multi&#8208;bit and Vis&#8208;Infrared Broadband Nonvolatile Optoelectronic Memory with MoS2/2D&#8208;perovskite van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nonvolatile optoelectronic memory (NVOM) integrating the functions of optical sensing and long&#8208;term memory can efficiently process and store a large amount of visual scene information, which has become the core requirement of multiple intelligence scenarios. However, realizing NVOM with Vis&#8208;infrared broadband response is still challenging. Herein, we realize the room temperature Vis&#8208;infrared broadband NVOM based on few&#8208;layer MoS2/2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) van der Waals heterojunction. It's found that the 2D&#8208;RPP converted the initial n&#8208;type MoS2 into p&#8208;type and facilitate hole transfer between them. Furthermore, the 2D&#8208;RPP rich of interband states serves as an effective electron trapping layer as well as broadband photoresponsive layer. As a result, the dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/2D&#8208;RPP heterojunction enables the charge to transfer quickly under external field, which enables a large memory window (104&#160;V), fast write speed of 20 &#956;s, and optical programmable characteristics from visible light (405&#160;nm) to telecommunication wavelengths (i.e., 1550&#160;nm) at room temperature. Trapezoidal optical programming can produce up to 100 recognizable states (&gt;6 bits), with operating energy as low as 5.1 pJ per optical program. Our results provide a route to realize fast, low power, multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic memory from visible to the infrared wavelength.

MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Static Random&#8208;Access Memory</title>

The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology. The process challenges of 2DM nanosheet field&#8208;effect transistors are also discussed.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Pass&#8208;Transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconductors</title>

A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <title>A Reconfigurable Two&#8208;WSe2&#8208;Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect is realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

Logic Circuits
Are 2D semiconductors ready for next&#8208;generation IC application? In article number 2202472, Yufeng Xie, Lifeng Bian, Wenzhong Bao, and co&#8208;workers present a wafer&#8208;scale demonstration by circuit&#8208;level fabrication on a 4&#8208;inch MoS2 wafer. While pass&#8208;transistor configuration is more like an expedient to build logic circuits based on n&#8208;type MoS2, future development should add complementary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors to realize more complex ICs.

Memory Cells
In article number 2106321, Yanqing Wu and co&#8208;workers report the smaller footprint of nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide transistors. By adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism, four&#8208;transistor nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory cells are realized for parallel search operations with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202106321"&gt;2106321&lt;/a&gt;, Yanqing Wu and co-workers report the smaller footprint of nonconventional computing-in-memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide transistors. By adopting the charge-trapping mechanism, four-transistor nonvolatile ternary content-addressable memory cells are realized for parallel search operations with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

Piezoelectric Electronics
In article number 2201630, Zhigao Hu, Zengfeng Di, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the synthesis of 2D Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy with variable W concentrations. By precisely tuning the fraction of W close to that of Mo, the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy has the highest configurational entropy and the best piezoelectric properties among Mo1&#8722;xWxS2&#8208;type alloys with different compositions.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Microwave Circuits: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

         <dc:description>
The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Progress and Challenges for Memtransistors in Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid&#8208;state circuits and systems. Gate&#8208;tunable learning and bio&#8208;realistic functions in multi&#8208;terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.








Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase&#8208;changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.

         <title>Revisiting the Nature of Chemical Bonding in Chalcogenides to Explain and Design their Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum chemical bonding descriptors have recently been utilized to design materials with tailored properties. We will review their usage to facilitate a quantitative description of bonding in chalcogenides as well as the transition between different bonding mechanisms. More importantly, these descriptors will also be employed as property predictors for several important material characteristics, including optical and transport properties. Hence, these quantum chemical bonding descriptors can be utilized to tailor material properties of chalcogenides relevant for thermoelectrics, photovoltaics and phase change memories. Relating material properties to bonding mechanisms also shows that there is a class of materials, which are characterized by unconventional properties such as a pronounced anharmonicity, a large chemical bond polarizability, and strong optical absorption. This unusual property portfolio is attributed to a novel bonding mechanism, fundamentally different from ionic, metallic and covalent bonding, which has been called &#8220;metavalent&#8221;. In the concluding chapter, a number of promising research directions are sketched, which explore the nature of the property changes upon changing bonding mechanism and extend the concept of quantum chemical property predictors to more complex compounds.

         <title>Ferromagnetic flexible electronics for brain&#8208;wide selective neural recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible microelectronics capable of straightforward implantation, remotely controlled navigation and stable long&#8208;term recording hold great promise in diverse medical applications, particularly in deciphering complex functions of neural circuits in the brain. Existing flexible electronics, however, are often limited in bending and buckling during implantation, only access to a small tissue region and additionally difficult to be accurately navigated and spatially targeted large groups of neurons with cellular specificity in the brain. Here, we present an injectable class of electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering and precise navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation. After simple transcriptional injection, the rigid coatings would be biodegraded quickly and the bundles of magnetic&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;coated microelectrodes became separated, ultra&#8208;flexible and magnetic actuated for further minimally invasive three&#8208;dimensional interpenetration in the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrated this paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for selective and multiplexed neural activities recording across distant regions in the deep rodent brains and confirmed the mechanical and electrical stability of this system. Coupling with optogenetic neural stimulation, we demonstrated the unique capabilities of this platform in electrophysiological readouts of projection dynamics in vivo. The ability of these miniaturized, remotely controllable and biocompatible ferromagnetic flexible electronics to afford minimally invasive manipulations in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadow applications in other organ systems, with great potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.

         <title>High Entropy Approach to Engineer Strongly Correlated Functionalities in Manganites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a new approach to materials design based on the inherent magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneities present in high entropy (HE) materials to manipulate and enhance strongly correlated functionalities in oxide systems. In this case study, substantial degree of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and unique lattice imperfections are observed in charge&#8208;doped HE&#8208;manganites.








Abstract
Technologically relevant strongly correlated phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and metal&#8208;insulator transitions (MIT) exhibited by perovskite manganites are driven and enhanced by the coexistence of multiple competing magneto&#8208;electronic phases. Such magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneity is governed by the intrinsic lattice&#8208;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbital correlations, which, in turn, are conventionally tailored in manganites via chemical substitution, charge doping, or strain engineering. Alternately, the recently discovered high entropy oxides (HEOs), owing to the presence of multiple&#8208;principal cations on a given sub&#8208;lattice, exhibit indications of an inherent magneto&#8208;electronic phase separation encapsulated in a single crystallographic phase. Here, the high entropy (HE) concept is combined with standard property control by hole doping in a series of single&#8208;phase orthorhombic HE&#8208;manganites (HE&#8208;Mn), (Gd0.25La0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.5). High&#8208;resolution transmission microscopy reveals hitherto&#8208;unknown lattice imperfections in HEOs: twins, stacking faults, and missing planes. Magnetometry and electrical measurements infer three distinct ground states&#8212;insulating antiferromagnetic, unpercolated metallic ferromagnetic, and long&#8208;range metallic ferromagnetic&#8212;coexisting or/and competing as a result of hole doping and multi&#8208;cation complexity. Consequently, CMR &#8776;1550% stemming from an MIT is observed in polycrystalline pellets, matching the best&#8208;known values for bulk conventional manganites. Hence, this initial case study highlights the potential for a synergetic development of strongly correlated oxides offered by the high entropy design approach.

         <title>Complex Oxides for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computers inspired by the brain offer the exciting prospect of energy efficiency. Complex oxides can serve as building blocks for brain&#8208;inspired computing owing to their adaptive electronic structure and high sensitivity to environmental stimuli.








Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. In this review, the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions, and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature, are discussed. The review begins with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect highlighted is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. The focus then turns to collective phenomena, such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions (MITs), ferroelectricity, and related examples, to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure, and in situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices are then discussed. The implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design is then revewed. Finally, outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms, which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing, are highlighted.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developments of biodegradable electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) have attracted considerable attention for successful application in wearable biosensors, artificial intelligence, physiological signal monitoring, robotics, and prosthetics. Progress in materials and various strategies for performance improvement of biodegradable e&#8208;skins and flexible electronics are comprehensively described. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are also outlined and extrapolated to future applications.








Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of the planet. Currently, the demand for wearable electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e&#8208;skins), and health monitoring is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e&#8208;skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e&#8208;skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e&#8208;skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials, and their recent applications in the development of biodegradable e&#8208;skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e&#8208;skins are critically discussed in a near&#8208;future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e&#8208;skins.

         <title>Ultrafast Non&#8208;Equilibrium Synthesis of Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock strategy is proposed to synthesize cathode materials in seconds for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, avoiding high energy and long time consumption. It provides an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics. Mainstream cathode materials are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance, indicative of a universal and efficient synthesis approach.








Abstract
The synthesis of cathode materials plays an important role in determining the production efficiency, cost, and performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, conventional synthesis methods always experience a slow heating rate and involve a complicated multistep reaction process and sluggish reaction dynamics, leading to high energy and long time consumption. Herein, a high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) strategy is reported for the ultrafast synthesis of cathode materials in seconds. The HTS process experiences an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics, and avoids high energy and long time consumption. Mainstream cathode materials (such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li&#8208;rich layered oxide/NiO heterostructured material) are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance. The HTS process not only provides an efficient synthesis approach for cathode materials, but also can be extended beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Endothelialization of Freeform 3D Network of Interconnected Tubular Channels via Interfacial Coacervation by Aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;aqueous Embedded Bioprinting</title>

Abstract
The challenge of bioprinting vascularized tissues is structure retention and in&#8208;situ endothelization. The issue is addressed by adopting an aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;aqueous 3D embedded bioprinting strategy, in which the interfacial coacervation of the cyto&#8208;mimic aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) are employed for maintaining the suspending liquid architectures, and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. By incorporating endothelial cells in the ink phase of ATPS, tubular lumens enclosed by coacervated complexes of polylysine (PLL) and oxidized bacteria celluloses (oxBC) can be cellularized with a confluent endothelial layer, without any help of adhesive peptides. By applying PLL/oxBC ATPS for embedded bioprinting, freeform 3D vascular networks with in&#8208;situ endothelialization of interconnected tubular lumens are achieved. Our simple approach is a one&#8208;step process without any sacrificed templates and post&#8208;treatments. The resultant functional vessel networks with arbitrary complexity are suspended in liquid medium and can be conveniently handled, opening new routes for the in vitro production of thick vascularized tissues for pathological research, regeneration therapy and animal&#8208;free drug development.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity in the Electroproduction of H2O2 via F/S Dual&#8208;Doping in Metal&#8208;Free Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is attracting broad interest in diversified areas including paper manufacturing, wastewater treatment, production of liquid fuels, and public sanitation. Current efforts focus on researching low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and sustainable electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity. Here we&#160;engineer large&#8208;scale H2O2 electrocatalysts based on metal&#8208;free carbon fibers with a fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping strategy. Optimized samples yield with a high onset potential of 0.814 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an almost an ideal 2e&#8722; pathway selectivity of 99.1%, outperforming most of the recent reported carbon&#8208;based or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First principle theoretical computations and experiments demonstrate that the intermolecular charge transfer coupled with electron spin redistribution from fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping is the crucial factor contributing to the enhanced performances in 2e&#8722; ORR. This work opens the door to the design and implementation of scalable, earth&#8208;abundant, highly selective electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and other catalytic fields of industrial&#160;interest.

         <title>Unconventional Spin State Driven Spontaneous Magnetization in a Praseodymium Iron Antimonide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Consolidating a microscopic understanding of magnetic properties is crucial for a rational design of magnetic materials with tailored characteristics. The interplay of 3d and 4f magnetism in rare earth transition metal antimonides is an ideal platform to search for such complex behavior. Here we report on the synthesis, crystal growth, structure and complex magnetic properties of the new compound Pr3Fe3Sb7 as studied by magnetization and electrical&#8208;transport measurements in static and pulsed magnetic fields up to 56&#160;T, powder neutron diffraction and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. On cooling without external magnetic field, Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. The Fe substructure exhibits noncollinear ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature TC &#8776;&#160;380 K. Two spin orientations exist, which approximately align along the Fe&#8211;Fe bond directions, one parallel to the ab plane and a second one with the moments canting away from the c axis. The Pr substructure orders below 40&#160;K, leading to a spin&#8208;reorientation transition (SRT) of the iron substructure. In low fields, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. At 1.4&#160;K, the magnetization approaches saturation above 40&#160;T. The compound exhibits metallic resistivity along the c axis, with a small anomaly at the SRT.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic relaxation of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in its blend with polymer donor raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of polymer solar cells. With flexible spacers to restrict the motion of individual SMAs, the tethered SMAs show higher efficiency, and, most important, large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains.








Abstract
For polymer solar cells (PSCs), the mixture of polymer donors and small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) is fine&#8208;tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record&#8208;holding Y&#8208;series SMAs. Here, a new class of dimeric Y6&#8208;based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers is reported to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, it is found that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart. Most importantly, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains. For the high&#8208;performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87&#160;V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6&#8208;base devices only reach 0.84&#160;V and 16.93%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer&#8208;based device possesses substantially reduced burn&#8208;in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700&#160;h. The tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron spin qubits in silicon are shown to serve as magnetic field sensors at the atomic scale. The work presents a novel spectroscopy technique where a pair of exchange&#8208;coupled electron spins on phosphorus qubits in silicon is used to probe the local magnetic fields to determine the exact location of nuclear spins within the silicon chip.








Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>Suppressing the Loss of Polymer&#8208;Based Dielectrics for High Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. The theoretical progress, measurement of properties, and development of materials are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities in loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectrics have received intensive interest from academic community in the field of high&#8208;power energy storage owing to their superior flexibility and fast charge&#8211;discharge ability. Recently, how to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. Some achievements are made in analyzing the source of loss and suppressing loss via Edison's trial and error method. In this review, the significance of suppressing loss in polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is firstly emphasized. Then, different sources of loss are discussed carefully and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the related measurements is presented. Next, recent research results in suppressing loss are summarized and discussed in detail according to different strategies. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ultrathin Chiral Metasurfaces by Twisted Stacking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple twisted stacking of two layers of nanomaterials can produce ultrathin planarized nanostructures with optical chirality. This review thoroughly examines the recent progress in ultrathin chiroptical metasurfaces prepared through chiral stacking, discussing the monolayer materials, fabrication strategies, and the induced circular dichroism. A special focus is placed on the flexible tunability of the chiroptical responses and relevant optical applications.








Abstract
Artificial chiral nanostructures have been subjected to extensive research for their unique chiroptical activities. Planarized chiral films of ultrathin thicknesses are in particular demand for easy on&#8208;chip integration and improved energy efficiency as polarization&#8208;sensitive metadevices. Recently, controlled twisted stacking of two or more layers of nanomaterials, such as 2D van der Waals materials, ultrathin films, or traditional metasurfaces, at an angle has emerged as a general strategy to introduce optical chirality into achiral solid&#8208;state systems. This method endows new degrees of freedom, e.g., the interlayer twist angle, to flexibly engineer and tune the chiroptical responses without having to change the material or the design, thus greatly facilitating the development of multifunctional metamaterials. In this review, recent exciting progress in planar chiral metasurfaces are summarized and discussed from the viewpoints of building blocks, fabrication methods, as well as circular dichroism and modulation thereof in twisted stacked nanostructures. The review further highlights the ever&#8208;growing portfolio of applications of these chiral metasurfaces, including polarization conversion, information encryption, chiral sensing, and as an engineering platform for hybrid metadevices. Finally, forward&#8208;looking prospects are provided.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VO2 manifests a remarkable metal&#8211;insulator transition that affords the nonlinear, dynamical response needed to emulate the function of biological neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic function is tunable through site&#8208;selective modification, stress, tuning of interfaces, and modification of external circuit elements. Strategies for modulating transformation characteristics are reviewed and inverse design approaches across decades of length and time scales are outlined.








Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by colocating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8211;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. Strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings, are discussed. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in situ processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. Mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics, is emphasized. Opportunities are highlighted for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small&#8208;Scale Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale soft robots have immense potential at present and in the foreseeable future, with utility in exploration, medical, and biomimetic applications, among others. Being enabling technologies, here, the fabrication and integration techniques of small&#8208;scale soft robots are systematically reviewed. By discussing the challenges and opportunities, potential directions for the further development of small&#8208;scale soft robots are highlighted.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale soft robots are attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real&#8208;time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating, and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. Here, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small&#8208;scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing, and swelling, small&#8208;scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism, and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability, and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetics, and other interdisciplinary sciences.

         <title>Fast Transport and Transformation of Biomacromolecular Substances via Thermo&#8208;Stimulated Active &#8220;Inhalation&#8211;Exhalation&#8221; Cycles of Hierarchically Structured Smart pNIPAM&#8211;DNA Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, highly efficient transport and transformation of biomacromolecular substances are achieved through the thermo&#8208;stimulated active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hierarchically structured smart DNA hydrogels. The application of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles in the poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;DNA hydrogels improves the catalytic efficiency of the incorporated DNAzyme or CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a systems by up to 280% or 390%, respectively.








Abstract
Although smart hydrogels hold great promise in biosensing and biomedical applications, their response to external stimuli is governed by the passive diffusion&#8208;dependent substance transport between hydrogels and environments and within the 3D hydrogel matrices, resulting in slow response to biomacromolecules and limiting their extensive applications. Herein, inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, an active strategy to achieve highly efficient biomolecular substance transport through the thermo&#8208;stimulated &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. The cryo&#8208;structured poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM)&#8211;DNA hydrogels, composed of functional DNA&#8208;tethered pNIPAM networks and free&#8208;water&#8208;containing macroporous channels, exhibit thermally triggered fast and reversible shrinking/swelling cycles with high&#8208;volume changes, which drive the formation of dynamic water stream to accelerate the intake of external substances and expelling of endogenous substances, thus promoting the functional properties of hydrogel systems. Demonstrated by catalytic DNAzyme and CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;incorporating hydrogels, significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency with up to 280% and 390% is achieved, upon the introduction of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles, respectively. Moreover, remotely near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggering of &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles is achieved after the introduction of NIR&#8208;responsive MXene nanosheets into the hydrogel matrix. These hydrogel systems with enhanced substance transport and transformation properties hold promise in the development of more effective biosensing and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas sensors are widely used in many areas. Compared to the traditional sensing materials including semiconductors, nanomaterials, and 2D materials, the emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential owing to the maximum atom utilization and unique chemical and physical properties. This work timely summarizes the recent progress and provides future perspectives on the SACs sensing.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) attract extensive attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis in recent years due to the maximum atom utilization and unique physical and chemical properties. The gas sensing is actually a heterogeneous catalysis process but the SACs are new to this area. Although SACs show huge potential in gas sensing, the SACs gas sensing area currently is still at the infancy stage. This work critically reviews the recent advances and current status of single&#8208;atom gas sensing materials. General synthesis routes, characterization methods, and sensing performance indexes are introduced. At the end, the challenges and future prospects on SACs gas sensing are presented from the authors&#8217; perspectives. This work is anticipated to provide insights and guideline for the chemical sensing community.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporal&#8208;efficient noise&#8208;resilient ferroelectric encoder, exploiting the time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike encoding scheme, is proposed for information preprocessing in spiking neural networks.&#160;Our&#160;device manifests prominent ferroelectric dynamics, showing an excellent classification accuracy of 95.14%, in addition to resilience against noise attacks. This work manifests the potential to enable spike&#8208;driven computations for energy&#8208;efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence. Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric encoder is demonstrated for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enable a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset for digit classification. Moreover, this ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset for digit classification. Moreover, this ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Confinement of Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles in Short Mesochannels for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal in situ confinement strategy is developed to synthesize ultrasmall metal nanoparticles in the mesochannels of 1D mesoporous carbon. The obtained catalysts show an impressive electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction performance with nearly 100% conversion efficiency, 98% N2&#160;selectivity, 55% current efficiency, an ultralong cycling stability over 30&#160;days, and an ultrahigh removal capacity of 15&#8201;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable approach for NO3&#8722; removal and high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing compounds manufacturing, which, however, is strongly obstructed by sluggish kinetics, low selectivity, and poor stability. Herein, the in situ confinement of ultrasmall CuPd alloy nanoparticles in mesochannels of conductive core&#8211;shell structured carbon nanotubes@mesoporous carbon substrates (CNTs@mesoC@CuPd) via a simple molecule&#8208;mediated interfacial assembly method is reported. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction, the CNTs@mesoC@CuPd shows a splendid conversion efficiency (100%), N2&#160;selectivity (98%), cycling stability (&gt;30&#160;days), and removal capacity as high as 30&#160;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd, which are much superior to most of the prior reports. Notably, experimental (in situ testing and isotopic labeling) and theoretical results unveil that bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction exhibit exclusive selectivity for N2&#160;and NH3, respectively. This in situ confinement strategy is universal for the synthesis of stable and highly accessible metallic catalysts, which opens an appealing way to synthesize advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimodal orientation of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer films exhibits a figure of merit of 0.40, which is more than 400% superior to the corresponding values of face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on unimodal films.








Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is an important task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, the achievement of ZT to 0.40 is reported by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibits a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic TE (OTE) materials.

         <title>Time&#8208;dependent Polychrome Stereoscopic Luminescence Triggered by Resonance Energy Transfer between Carbon Dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite Composites and Fluorescence Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract
Luminescence multiplexing shows promising application prospects in information security, yet even outstanding time division multiplexing can only carry limited luminescence information. Time&#8208;space division multiplexing can greatly expand the information capacity by simultaneously transferring luminescence information in both time and space dimensions, but it has not been reported yet. Herein, time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system has been successfully developed by designing a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) luminescence system based on resonance energy transfer (RET), in which afterglow lifetime easily regulated carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites are used as energy donors and multicolor fluorescence quantum dots (QDs) as energy acceptors. Taking perovskite QDs (PeQDs) as example, by matching the energy donors with different afterglow lifetimes and the energy acceptors with different fluorescence colors, tunable afterglow emission of PeQDs with wavelength within 463&#8211;614&#160;nm and lifetime within 232&#8211;1500&#160;ms can be realized, in which the maximal RET efficiency reaches 95%. As a proof of concept, such novel luminescence system that carries 8 layers of luminescence information involving 4 dimensions (time and 3D space) is successfully applied in advanced time&#8208;space division multiplexing. This work opens a new perspective for the application of time&#8208;space integrated luminescence systems in advanced information multiplexing.

         <title>Stable Anode&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Tuned Metal Wetting on the Copper Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stable anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (AF&#8208;ASSB) with sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (SE) (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl, LPSCl) is achieved by tuning wetting of lithium metal on &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current&#8208;collector. Lithiophilic 1&#160;&#956;m Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#8208;situ Li activation during the first charge. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency (CE). During continuous plating experiments using half&#8208;cells (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the accumulated thickness of electrodeposited Li on Li2Te&#8208;Cu is more than 70&#160;&#956;m, which is the thickness of Li foil counter&#8208;electrode. Full AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811 cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%. Cryo&#8208;FIB sectioning demonstrates uniform electrodeposited metal microstructure, with no signs of voids or dendrites at the collector&#8208;SE interface. Electrodissolution is uniform and complete, with Li2Te remaining structurally stable and adherent. By contrast, unmodified Cu current&#8208;collector promotes inhomogeneous Li electrodeposition/electrodissolution, electrochemically inactive &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, dendrites that extend into SE, and thick non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interspersed with pores. Density functional theory and mesoscale calculations provide complementary insight regarding nucleation&#8208;growth behavior. Unlike for conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte metal batteries, the role of current collector/support lithiophilicy has not been explored for emerging AF&#8208;ASSBs.

         <title>Overcoming the Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH&#8208;Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
CRISPR genome editing has demonstrated great potential to treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain&#8208;targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a substantial challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;In this study, we created a library of GSH&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) and screened them for brain targeting via systemic delivery of nucleic acids and CRISPR genome editors. In vivo studies demonstrated that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and RVG peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein) targeting both exogenous genes (i.e., Ai14 stop cassette) and disease&#8208;relevant endogenous genes (i.e., App and Th genes) in Ai14 reporter mice and wild&#8208;type mice, respectively. In particular, we observed up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild&#8208;type mice. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR genome editing has demonstrated great potential to treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain-targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which represents a substantial challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;In this study, we created a library of GSH-responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) and screened them for brain targeting via systemic delivery of nucleic acids and CRISPR genome editors. In vivo studies demonstrated that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and RVG peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain-wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein) targeting both exogenous genes (i.e., Ai14 stop cassette) and disease-relevant endogenous genes (i.e., &lt;i&gt;App&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; genes) in Ai14 reporter mice and wild-type mice, respectively. In particular, we observed up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (&lt;i&gt;App&lt;/i&gt;) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (&lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild-type mice. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Response to Precision Medicine: Current Subcellular Targeting Strategies for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging as a potent anti&#8208;cancer treatment, subcellular targeted cancer therapy has drawn increasing attention, bringing great opportunities for clinical application. In this review, we summarize two targeting strategies for four main subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus), including molecule and nanomaterial (inorganic nanoparticles, micelles, organic polymers, and others)&#8208;based targeted delivery or therapeutic strategies. Phototherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; combination therapy are among the strategies covered in detail. Such materials have been constructed based on the specific properties and relevant mechanisms of organelles, enabling the elimination of tumors by inducing dysfunction in the corresponding organelles or destroying specific structures. The challenges faced by organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapies are also summarized. Looking forward, we envision a paradigm for organelle&#8208;targeting therapy with enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to current clinical approaches.

         <title>Stamp&#8208;like Energy Harvester and Programmable Information Encrypted Display based on Fully Printable Thermoelectric Devices</title>

Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) devices exhibit considerable application potential in Internet of Things and personal health monitoring systems. However, TE self&#8208;powered devices are expensive and their fabrication process is complex. Therefore, large&#8208;scale preparation of the TE devices remains challenging. In this work, simple screen&#8208;printing technology was used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly and high&#8208;performance paper&#8208;based TE device, which can be used in both stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TE generators and infrared displays. When used as a paper&#8208;based TE generator, an output power of 940.8 &#956;W was achieved with a temperature difference of 40 K. The programmable infrared pattern based on the TE array display could be used to realize encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting properties. Moreover, a visual extraction algorithm was used to develop a mobile application for processing and decoding the infrared quick response code information. Our findings offer an exciting approach to using paper&#8208;based TEGs in applications such as energy harvesting devices, optical encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and dynamic infrared display.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices could allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, we report a biaxially&#8208;interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths was conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers were used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds were populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Interweaved High Sulfur Loading Li&#8208;S Cathode by Catalytically Active Metalloporphyrin Based Organic Polymer Binders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The elaborate design of powerful Li&#8208;S binders with extended&#8208;functions like polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li+ hopping/transferring in addition to robust adhesion&#8208;property has remained a challenge. Here, we report an in&#8208;situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin based covalent&#8208;bonding organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni and Zn) binders for the first time. Thus&#8208;produced functional binders possess excellent mechanical&#8208;strengths, polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li+ hopping/transferring ability. Specifically, the modulus of Mn&#8208;COP can reach up to &#8764;54.60&#160;GPa (&#8764;40 times higher than PVDF) and the relative cell delivers a high initial&#8208;capacity (1027 mAh g&#8722;1, 1 C and 913 mAh g&#8722;1, 2 C), and excellent cycling&#8208;stability for &gt;1000 cycles even at 4 C. The utilization&#8208;rate of sulfur can reach up to 81.8% and the electrodes based on these powerful binders can be easily scale&#8208;up fabricated (&#8764;20&#160;cm in a batch&#8208;experiment). Noteworthy, Mn&#8208;COP based cell delivers excellent capacities at a high sulfur&#8208;loading (8.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and low E/S ratio (5.8&#160;&#956;L mg&#8722;1), and the utilization&#8208;rate of sulfur is as high as 81.8%, which is the optimal binder performance in Li&#8208;S battery as far as we know and has much potential to meet the &#8220;4H&#8221; and &#8220;4L&#8221; criteria. In addition, theoretical calculations reveal the vital roles of metalloporphyrin and thiourea&#8208;groups in enhancing the battery&#8208;performance.

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;P Alloy Foil to a Well&#8208;Designed Integrated Electrode Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanostructured integrated electrodes with binder&#8208;free design show great potential to solve the ever&#8208;growing problems faced by currently commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries such as insufficient power and energy densities. However, there are still many challenging problems that limit the practical application of this emerging technology, in particular complex manufacturing process, high fabrication cost, and low loading mass of active material. Different from those existing fabrication strategies, here using a Co&#8208;P alloy foil as precursor we demonstrate a simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying method to well address the above issues. The resultant freestanding mesoporous np&#8208;Co(OH)x/Co2P product possesses not only active compositions of high specific capacity and large electrode packing density (&gt;3.0&#160;g cm&#8211;3) to meet the practical capacity requirement, high&#8208;conductivity and well&#8208;developed nanoporous framework to achieve simultaneously fast ion and electron transfer, but also interconnected ligaments and suitable free space to ensure strong structure stability. Its comprehensively excellent electrochemical energy storage (EES) performances in both lithium/sodium&#8208;ion batteries and lithium&#8208;ion capacitors can further illustrate the effectiveness of our integrated electrode preparation strategy, such as remarkable reversible specific capacities/capacitances, dominated pseudo&#8208;capacitive EES mechanism, and ultra&#8208;long cycling life. This study provides new insights for the preparation and design of high&#8208;performance integrated electrodes toward practical applications.

         <title>Complex Living Materials made by Light&#8208;based Printing of Genetically Programmed Bacteria</title>

Abstract
Living materials with embedded microorganisms can genetically encode attractive sensing, self&#8208;repairing and responsive functionalities for applications in medicine, robotics and infrastructure. While the synthetic toolbox for genetically engineering bacteria continues to expand, technologies to shape bacteria&#8208;laden living materials into complex three&#8208;dimensional geometries are still rather limited. Here, we show that bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light&#8208;based printing techniques. Bioluminescent and melanin&#8208;producing bacteria are used to create complex materials with autonomous chemical&#8208;sensing capabilities by harnessing the metabolic activity of wild&#8208;type and engineered microorganisms. The shaping freedom offered by printing technologies and the rich biochemical diversity available in bacteria provides ample design space for the creation and exploration of complex living materials with programmable functionalities for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Entering A New Dimension in Powder Processing for Advanced Ceramics Shaping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Filigree structures can be manufactured via two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization (2PP) operating in the regime of non&#8208;linear light absorption. For the first time it is possible to apply this technique to the powder processing of ceramic structures with a feature size in the range of the critical defect size responsible for brittle fracture and, thus, affecting fracture toughness of high&#8208;performance ceramics. In this way, tailoring of advanced properties can be achieved already in the shaping process. Traditionally, 2PP relies on transparent polymerizable resins, which is diametrically opposed to the usually completely opaque ceramic resins and slurries. Here we present a transparent and photocurable suspension of nanoparticles (resin) with very high mass fractions of yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia particles (YSZ). Due to the extremely well dispersed nanoparticles, scattering of light can be effectively suppressed at the process&#8208;relevant wavelength of 800&#160;nm. Sintered ceramic structures with a resolution of down to 500&#160;nm were obtained. Even at reduced densities of 1 to 4&#160;g/cm3, the resulting compressive strength with 4,5&#160;GPa is equivalent or even exceeding bulk monolithic yttria stabilized zirconia. A ceramic metamaterial is born, where the mechanical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia are altered by changing geometrical parameters and gives access to a new class of ceramic materials.

         <title>Scalable Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron/Nickel Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density up to 200&#160;Wh L&#8722;1</title>

Abstract
Achieving net&#8208;zero emissions requires low&#8208;cost and reliable energy storage devices that are essential to deploy renewables. Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries such as alkaline zinc&#8208;iron (or nickel) flow batteries are well&#8208;suited for energy storage because of their high safety, high efficiency, and low cost. Nevertheless, their energy density is limited by the low solubility of ferro/ferricyanide and the limited areal capacity of sintered nickel electrodes. Here, combining the electrochemical reaction with the chemical reaction of ferro/ferricyanide couple in a home&#8208;made nickel electrode, we report an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with a high energy density of 208.9&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 84.7% at a high current density of 80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The reversible chemical reactions between dual couples are proven to stabilize the nickel electrode by promoting the activation of the nickel electrode and further preventing the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. A kW&#8208;scale stack is demonstrated by the integration of ferro/ferricyanide couple with nickel electrode, delivering a coulombic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 89% at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates a promising pathway for constructing and upscaling flow batteries with high energy density and low cost.

         <title>Efficient inverted perovskite solar cells via improved sequential deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processibility and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, we demonstrate an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability has been achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets. Induced by this synergistic effect, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles.








Abstract
The lack of safe and efficient hydrogen storage is a major bottleneck for large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy. Reversible hydrogen storage of light&#8208;weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH2 as an example, a concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH2 indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH2 upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiHx species that are in situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH2, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH2. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.

Reversible hydrogen storage of light-weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, a concept is demonstrated to achieve solar-driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiH&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species that are in situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong, Thermally Stable, and Food&#8208;Safe&#160;Seaweed&#8208;Based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted through an efficient and low energy consuming way. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong structural material can be prepared. It possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with better overall performance than that of commercial tableware, showing great application potential in the tableware field.








Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, nondegradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by tableware composed of biodegradable structural materials with both food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#160;&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>A Template Editing Strategy to Create Interlayer&#8208;Confined Active Species for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture is created by template editing, suppressing the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation and exhibiting efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER&#8208;related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, a template editing strategy is proposed to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, two types of NiO6 units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks are selectively edited by chemical etching&#8208;assisted electroxidation to create layered &#947;&#8208;NiOOH with intercalated Ni&#8211;O species. In such an interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high&#8208;density intercalated Ni&#8211;O species, which also suppresses the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous&#8208;like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links and conducting polymers enables access to an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network (E&#8208;SPN) exhibiting tissue&#8208;mimetic softness and stretchablity. The resultant material allows for fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of comfortably and accurately measuring electromyography signals in real time. This research will offer a step toward the design and construction of next&#8208;generation, skin&#8208;like bioelectronics.








Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet, and stretchable. Here, an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body, is introduced. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8211;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic cross&#8208;links, coupled with in situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Large Magneto&#8208;Transverse and Longitudinal Thermoelectric Effects in the Magnetic Weyl Semimetal TbPtBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Huge magneto&#8208;transverse and longitudinal power factors are simultaneously detected in the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi. This can be ascribed to the magnetic field&#8208;enhanced transverse and longitudinal thermopower induced by bipolar effect, and large Hall angle related to the large net Berry curvature and high carrier mobility, and the incompletely compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance, respectively.








Abstract
Magnetic topological semimetals provide new opportunities for power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling based on thermoelectric (TE) effect. The interplay between magnetism and nontrivial band topology prompts the magnetic topological semimetals to yield strong transverse TE effect, while the longitudinal TE performance is usually poor. Herein, it is demonstrated that the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi has high value for both transverse and longitudinal thermopower with large power factor (PF). At 300&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, the transverse thermopower and PF reach up to 214&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and 35&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, respectively, which are comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TE materials. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations, longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall resistance measurements, and two&#8208;band model fitting, the large transverse thermopower and PF are attributed to both bipolar effect and large Hall angle. Moreover, the imperfectly compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance induce the maximum magneto&#8208;longitudinal thermopower of 251&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 with a PF of 24&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 at 150&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, which is two times higher than that at zero magnetic field. This work demonstrates the great potential of topological semimetals for TEs and offers a new excellent candidate for magneto&#8208;TEs.

Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin&#8208;film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid&#8208;state battery architecture and thin&#8208;film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for IoT&#8208;enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet&#8208;connected devices for the IoT are discussed. Recent progress in thin&#8208;film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next&#8208;generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells, but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance, and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein we report the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#956;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the resulting substrates have a porosity of 90%, a roughness factor of 15.8 and a Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100&#160;nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gave a sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and a loss of incident light of 41% at an illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates was established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating) and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates was confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production was demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Mesoporous PdN Alloy Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdN alloy nanocubes are reported as the highly active and selective electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to recyclable ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3). The remarkable performance results from combined synergies of mesoporous structure and PdN alloy, which facilitate the adsorption and reactivity of NO3&#8722; and enhance the retention time of electrocatalyzing NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron transfer pathway.








Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is very important for synthesizing recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environmentally friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso&#8208;PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, suppressing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis for more than 20 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso&#8208;PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO3&#8722; and the desorption of NH3 but also increase the retention time of key intermediates for the deeper NITRR electrocatalysis to NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron pathway.

         <title>Engineering Spin Configurations of Synthetic Antiferromagnet by Controlling Long&#8208;Range Oscillatory Interlayer Coupling and Neighboring Ferrimagnetic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable manipulation of the inner spin configuration of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb heterostructure is achieved by controlling long&#8208;range interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. Based on controllable spin regulations, ferrimagnetic&#8208;based synesthetic antiferromagnetic devices with compensated magnetization, enhanced Hall resistance, and wide&#8208;temperature stable spin&#8208;orbit torque switching are realized, which are of great interest for the realistic spin&#8208;orbitronic applications.








Abstract
Controllable manipulation of specific spin configurations of magnetic materials is the key to constructing functional spintronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated by integrating the merits of ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic spin configurations into one synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) heterostructure by controlling both long&#8208;range oscillatory interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. A controllable manipulation of four types of spin configurations of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb SAF heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Co/Pt/Co and ferrimagnetic CoTb layers is successfully achieved. In particular, the compensated magnetization, enhanced anomalous Hall resistance in the remanence state, wide&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque switching of magnetization, and high immunity to the external magnetic field are simultaneously obtained in one of the SAF heterojunctions with macroscopic interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling. This design concept of engineering spin configurations may enable efficient spin manipulation for customized memory and logic applications.

         <title>Engineered Phage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer in Cocktail Therapy against Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, we propose a novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE&#8208;PS) TBTCP&#8208;PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE&#8208;PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed a strong &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.

         <dc:description>
The phase transition, multiple valence bands, and resonant bonding endow GeTe with promising thermoelectric performance. Significant breakthroughs are achieved in GeTe&#8208;based materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in developing high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based materials and devices, including the underlying fundamentals, large&#8208;scale production, novel strategies for boosting performance, and techniques of device assembly.








Abstract
Driven by the intensive efforts in the development of high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectrics for mass&#8208;market application in power generation and refrigeration, GeTe&#8208;based materials display a high figure of merit of &gt;2.0 and an energy conversion efficiency beyond 10%. However, a comprehensive review on GeTe, from fundamentals to devices, is still needed. In this regard, the latest progress on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeTe is timely reviewed. The phase transition, intrinsic high carrier concentration, and multiple band edges of GeTe are fundamentally analyzed from the perspectives of the native atomic orbital, chemical bonding, and lattice defects. Then, the fabrication methods are summarized with a focus on large&#8208;scale production. Afterward, the strategies for enhancing electronic transports of GeTe by energy filtering effect, resonance doping, band convergence, and Rashba band splitting, and the methods for strengthening phonon scatterings via nanoprecipitates, planar vacancies, and superlattices, are comprehensively reviewed. Besides, the device assembly and performance are highlighted. In the end, future research directions are concluded and proposed, which enlighten the development of broader thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Panoramic Mapping of Phonon Transport from Ultrafast Electron Diffraction and Scientific Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integrated experimental&#8208;machine learning framework that extracts crucial hidden phonon thermal transport properties from ultrafast diffraction. The phonon transport results in local atomic vibrations that further links to the time&#8208;dependent diffraction intensities. By using adjoint&#8208;state scientific machine learning approach to solve the inverse thermal transport containing thousands of coupled differential equations, the hidden phonon properties can be reliably uncovered.








Abstract
One central challenge in understanding phonon thermal transport is a lack of experimental tools to investigate frequency&#8208;resolved phonon transport. Although recent advances in computation lead to frequency&#8208;resolved information, it is hindered by unknown defects in bulk regions and at interfaces. Here, a framework that can uncover microscopic phonon transport information in heterostructures is presented, integrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) with advanced scientific machine learning (SciML). Taking advantage of the dual temporal and reciprocal&#8208;space resolution in UED, and the ability of SciML to solve inverse problems involving O(103)$\mathcal{O}({10^3})$ coupled Boltzmann transport equations, the frequency&#8208;dependent interfacial transmittance and frequency&#8208;dependent relaxation times of the heterostructure from the diffraction patterns are reliably recovered. The framework is applied to experimental Au/Si UED data, and a transport pattern beyond the diffuse mismatch model is revealed, which further enables a direct reconstruction of real&#8208;space, real&#8208;time, frequency&#8208;resolved phonon dynamics across the interface. The work provides a new pathway to probe interfacial phonon transport mechanisms with unprecedented&#160;details.

         <title>Regulating Charge Carrier Recombination in the Interconnecting Layer to Boost the Efficiency and Stability of Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The charge carriers of single&#8208;junction solar cells can be fluently extracted and then collected by electrodes, leading to weak charge carrier accumulation and low energy loss (Eloss). However, in tandem solar cells (TSCs), it is a considerable challenge to obtain a balance between the densities of the holes and electrons extracted from the two respective subcells to facilitate an efficient recombination in the interconnecting layer (ICL). Herein, a charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs is proposed, centered on the simultaneous regulation of the defect states of CsPbI1.9Br1.1 perovskite in front subcell and hole transport ability from the perovskite to ICL. The target hole density on the perovskite surface and the hole loss before reaching the ICL are significantly improved. As a result, the hole/electron density offset in the ICL can be effectively narrowed, leading to a balanced charge carrier recombination, which reduces the Eloss in TSCs. The resulting inorganic perovskite/organic 0.062&#8208;cm2 TSC exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17% with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.15&#160;V, and the PCE of the 1.004&#8208;cm2 device (21.69%) exhibited a weak size&#8208;dependence. This charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy can also effectively enhance the operational and ultraviolet&#8208;light stabilities of the TSCs.

         <title>Microparticles Decorated with Cell&#8208;Instructive Surface Chemistries Actively Promote Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wound healing is a complex biological process involving close crosstalk between various cell types. Dysregulation in any of these processes, such as in diabetic wounds, results in chronic non&#8208;healing wounds. Fibroblasts are a critical cell type involved in the formation of granulation tissue, essential for effective wound healing. We screened 315 different polymer surfaces to identify candidates which actively drove fibroblasts towards either pro&#8208; or anti&#8208;proliferative functional phenotypes. Fibroblast&#8208;instructive chemistries were identified, which we synthesized into surfactants to fabricate easy to administer microparticles for direct application to diabetic wounds. The pro&#8208;proliferative microfluidic derived particles were able to successfully promote neovascularisation, granulation tissue formation and wound closure after a single application to the wound bed. These active novel 3D bio&#8208;instructive microparticles show great potential as a route to reducing the burden of chronic wounds.

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic&#8208;crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous&#8208;structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion&#8208;conducting, plastic&#8208;crystal pathways with long&#8208;range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) at 20 &#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#181;m thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi0.83Mn0.06Co0.11O2 (NMC&#8208;83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1. The established structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid&#8208;state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal paper are fabricated by shear coating on the wrinkled interpenetrating network rubber substrate to reflect the same color regardless of viewing angle. The wrinkled photonic crystal paper can be applied as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting film and wide&#8208;angle monochromatic light reflector.








Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) are fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface is combined. Fully polymerizable CLC paints are uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures results in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provides a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP is remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe&#8208;wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, 2D wavy&#8208;wrinkled PCP is successfully developed that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

         <title>Filler&#8208;Integrated Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview on filler&#8208;integrated composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is provided. The categories of fillers and their mechanisms in enhancing ionic conductivity are briefly summarized. Rational design of filler&#8211;polymer interface and filler&#8208;promoted electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is further elaborated. Challenges and directions are outlined, especially a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs is proposed.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) utilizing fillers as the promoting component bridge the gap between solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. The integration of fillers into the polymer matrices is demonstrated as a prevailing strategy to enhance Li&#8208;ion transport and assist in constructing Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface layer, which addresses the two key barriers of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs): low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and high interfacial impedance. Recent review articles have largely focused on the performance of a broad spectrum of CPEs and the general effects of fillers on SSLBs device. Recognizing this, in this review, after briefly presenting the categories of fillers (traditional and emerged) and the promoted ionic conducting mechanisms in CPEs, the progress in the interfacial structure design principle, with the emphasis on the crucial influence of filler size, concentration, and hybridization strategies on filler&#8211;polymer interface that is the most critical to Li&#8208;ion transport is assessed. The latest exciting advances on filler&#8208;enabled in situ generation of a Li+&#8208;conductive layer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface to greatly reduce the interfacial impedance are further elaborated. Finally, this review discusses the challenges to be addressed, outlines research directions, and provides a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs.

         <title>Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analogue Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain&#8208;computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analogue (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N&#8208;coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) computations and application of electron transfer theory to in&#8208;situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine&#8208;mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain&#8208;computer interfacing.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the renewable, ultrathin, large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a cross&#8208;linker, the large&#8208;area, ultralight yet robust MXene&#8208;based aerogels with multifunctionality are prepared through the simple, energy&#8208;efficient, and scalable ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried approach. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, dye adsorption, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil.








Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, 1D nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. This work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;free systems utilize the bioactivity of key cellular reactions&#8212;transcription and translation&#8212;in vitro, where the restriction of sustaining life is eliminated. Supplementation of exogenous genes or substrates into the reactions enables the production of a wide variety of innovative materials beyond the capability of living systems.








Abstract
Motivated by the intricate mechanisms underlying biomolecule syntheses in cells that chemistry is currently unable to mimic, researchers have harnessed biological systems for manufacturing novel materials. Cell&#8208;free systems (CFSs) utilizing the bioactivity of transcriptional and translational machineries in vitro are excellent tools that allow supplementation of exogenous materials for production of innovative materials beyond the capability of natural biological systems. Herein, recent studies that have advanced the ability to expand the scope of biobased materials using CFS are summarized and approaches enabling the production of high&#8208;value materials, prototyping of genetic parts and modules, and biofunctionalization are discussed. By extending the reach of chemical and enzymatic reactions complementary to cellular materials, CFSs provide new opportunities at the interface of materials science and synthetic biology.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell&#8208;Based Meat Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edible prolamin scaffolds with a highly ordered tessellated structure are printed based on the electrohydrodynamic printing technique after formulating food&#8208;grade zein/hordein and zein/secalin inks. Mouse skeletal myoblasts and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells show favorable cellular activities on the prepared fibrous matrix, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in cultured meat production.








Abstract
Cultivating meat from muscle stem cells in vitro requires 3D edible scaffolds as the supporting matrix. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing is an emerging 3D&#8208;printing technology for fabricating ultrafine fibrous scaffolds with high precision microstructures for biomedical applications. However, edible EHD&#8208;printed scaffolds remain scarce in cultured meat (CM) production partly due to special requirements with regard to the printability of ink. Here, hordein or secalin is mixed, which are cereal prolamins extracted from barley or rye, with zein to produce pure prolamin&#8208;based inks, which exhibit favorable printability similar to common polycaprolactone ink. Zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds with highly ordered tessellated structures are successfully fabricated after optimizing printing conditions. The prolamin scaffolds demonstrated good water stability and in vitro degradability due to the porous fiber surface, which is spontaneously generated by culturing muscle cells for 1&#160;week. Moreover, mouse skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs) can adhere and proliferate on the fibrous matrix, and a CM slice is produced by culturing PSCs on prolamin scaffolds with high tissue similarity. The upregulation of myogenic proteins shows that the differentiation process is triggered in the 3D culture, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in CM production.

         <title>Multiple Fusion Strategy for High&#8208;performance Yellow OLEDs with Full Width at Half Maximums down to 23&#160;nm and External Quantum Efficiencies up to 37.4%</title>

Abstract
The pursuit of ideal narrowband yellow multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters is hampered by the mutual constraints of effective spectral redshift and maintaining a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) value. Here, we report a novel multiple fusion molecular design strategy to break this trade&#8208;off. Compared with the selected narrowband parent core, the specific multiple MR effects in target molecules can simultaneously extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length, increase the rigidity of the structure, and reduce the vibrational frequency. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters BN&#8208;DICz and DBN&#8208;ICz show bright yellowish green to yellow emissions in dilute toluene solutions with peaks at 533&#8211;542&#160;nm and extremely small FWHMs of &#8804; 20&#160;nm. Notably, BN&#8208;DICz based electroluminescent device exhibits excellent efficiencies of 37.4%, 136.6&#160;cd/A, and 119.2&#160;lm/W with an FWHM of merely 23&#160;nm, representing the best performance for yellow MR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Ultrafast coherent THz lattice dynamics coupled to spins in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3</title>

Abstract
Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8208;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS3. We investigate the laser&#8208;driven lattice and spin dynamics in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm&#8208;thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump&#8208;probe magneto&#8208;optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long&#8208;range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2 THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which we utilize to excite the hybridized phonon&#8208;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway towards the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8208;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled multi&#8208;Level asymmetric mesochannels for coupled accelerated dual&#8208;Ion selective transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Asymmetric nanofluidic devices hold great potential in energy conversion applications. However, most of the existing asymmetric nanofluidic devices remain a single&#8208;level asymmetric structure and a single&#8208;ion selective layer, which results in weak ion selectivity and limited energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/anodized aluminum/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) nanofluidic device with abundant and ordered mesochannels is constructed from super&#8208;assembly strategy. The resultant MC/AAO/MS exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport and outstanding ion storage&#8208;release performance. Importantly, MC/AAO/MS couples the MC and MS dual&#8208;ion selective layers, which ensures a high ionic conductance and evidently enhances the cation selectivity. Thereby, the MC/AAO/MS demonstrates ascendant salinity gradient energy conversion performance. The power density and conversion efficiency can reach up to 5.37&#160;W/m2 and 32.79%, respectively. Noteworthy, a good energy conversion performance of 63&#160;mW/m2 can still be achieved upon high working area, outperforming 300% of the performance of MC/AAO and MS/AAO single&#8208;level asymmetric nanochannels. Theoretical calculation further verifies that the multi&#8208;level asymmetric structure and dual&#8208;ion selective transport are the reason for the enhanced cation selectivity and energy conversion efficiency. This work opens a new avenue for constructing multi&#8208;level asymmetric structured nanofluidic devices for various applications.

         <title>Controllable Gold Nanocluster&#8211;Emulsion Interface for Direct Cell Penetration and Photothermal Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed tailorable amphiphilic gold nanoclusters facilitate the dynamic formation of emulsions by engaging in interfacial coupling, which enhances emulsion stability and nanocluster photophysical performance. The segregated interfacial microdomains of nanoclusters on the emulsion surface determine their biointerfacial interactions and allow them to directly penetrate cell membranes. The developed functional emulsions are well suited for multifluorescence tracing and photothermal killing.








Abstract
In the view of their ability to be uptaken by cells, colloidal particles can exert diverse physiological effects and are promising vehicles for the intracellular delivery of biologically active substances. Given that the modulation of biomaterial interfaces greatly facilitates the prediction and control of the corresponding cellular responses, the interfacial behavior of hydrophobic dye&#8208;modified gold (Au) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is rationally designed to develop Au NC&#8208;containing emulsions and control their biointerfacial interactions with cell membranes. The observed biological performance is indicative of a physical penetration mechanism. The amphiphilic Au NCs decrease the interfacial energy of two immiscible liquids and hinder droplet coalescence to facilitate the formation of emulsions thermodynamically stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the amphiphilic Au NCs are localized on the emulsion droplet surface and form segregated interfacial microdomains that adapt to the membrane structure and facilitate the traverse of the emulsions across the cell membrane via direct penetration. Fast penetration coupled with excellent photophysical performance endows the emulsions with multifluorescence tracing and efficient photothermal killing capabilities. The successful change of the interaction mode between NCs and biological objects and the provision of a universal formulation to modulate biointerfacial interactions are expected to inspire new bioapplications.

         <title>Colored Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells Exceeding 23.5% Efficiency Enabled by Luminescent Down&#8208;Shift Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Colored solar panels, realized by depositing various reflection layers or structures, are emerging as power sources for building with visual aesthetics. However, these panels suffer from reduced photocurrent generation due to the less efficient light harvesting from visible light reflection and degraded power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, color&#8208;patterned silicon heterojunction solar cells were achieved by incorporating luminescent quantum dots (QDs) with high quantum yields as light converters to realize an asthenic appearance with high PCE. We found that large bandgap (blue) QD layers can convert ultraviolet light into visible light, which can notably alleviate the parasitic absorption by the front indium tin oxide and doped amorphous silicon. Additionally, a universal optical path model was proposed to understand the light transmission process, which is suitable for luminescent down&#8208;shift (LDS) devices. In this study, solar cells with a PCE exceeding 23.5% were achieved using the combination of a blue QD layer and a top low refractive index anti&#8208;reflection layer; the obtained PCE was the highest for a color&#8208;patterned solar cell. Our results suggest an enhanced strategy involving incorporation of luminescent QDs with an optical path design for high&#8208;performance photovoltaic panels with visual aesthetics.

&lt;p&gt;Colored solar panels, realized by depositing various reflection layers or structures, are emerging as power sources for building with visual aesthetics. However, these panels suffer from reduced photocurrent generation due to the less efficient light harvesting from visible light reflection and degraded power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, color-patterned silicon heterojunction solar cells were achieved by incorporating luminescent quantum dots (QDs) with high quantum yields as light converters to realize an asthenic appearance with high PCE. We found that large bandgap (blue) QD layers can convert ultraviolet light into visible light, which can notably alleviate the parasitic absorption by the front indium tin oxide and doped amorphous silicon. Additionally, a universal optical path model was proposed to understand the light transmission process, which is suitable for luminescent down-shift (LDS) devices. In this study, solar cells with a PCE exceeding 23.5% were achieved using the combination of a blue QD layer and a top low refractive index anti-reflection layer; the obtained PCE was the highest for a color-patterned solar cell. Our results suggest an enhanced strategy involving incorporation of luminescent QDs with an optical path design for high-performance photovoltaic panels with visual aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lightweight 3D Graphene Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials science involves trade&#8208;offs between mechanical deterioration and thermal instability. The concept of metamaterials has been proposed as a novel approach to overcome the exclusive responses among physical properties by artificially designing structures at multiple scales, beyond new component compositions or chemical modifications. In this study, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) graphene metamaterial (GM) showing negative thermal expansion was prepared using a strategy of hyperbolically&#8208;oriented freezing under a dual temperature gradient along orthogonal directions after the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly of 2D graphene sheets. As the fundamental construction element of the 3D GM, the graphene sheet displayed anomalous shrinking deformation with a thermal expansion coefficient of (&#8722;6.12 &#177; 0.28) &#215; 10&#8722;6 that was triggered by thermally&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrations of the C&#8208;C bonds. A combination of numerical simulations and experimental investigations validated that anomalous negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior can be effectively delivered to scalable 3D GM candidates at larger dimensions beyond the basic 2D graphene sheets at the microscale. The multiscale design and optimization of the structural characterization of the 3D GM further realized the desirable regulation of the NTE performance with the NTE coefficient ranging from negative ((&#8722;7.5&#177; 0.65) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) to near&#8208;zero values ((&#8722;0.8 &#177; 0.25) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1)). This was attributed to the NTE&#8208;derived release regulation of the primary stress/strain of the microstructure, and the 3D GM exhibited high thermal stability while preserving the desirable structural robustness and fatigue resistance under thermo&#8208;mechanical coupling conditions. Therefore, this 3D GM offers promising potential for applications as protective skin, thermal actuator, smart switcher, and packing filler

         <title>A new class of cluster&#8208;matrix nanocomposite Made of fully miscible components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions were synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atoms Ni&#8208;clusters and an atomic flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel Cluster Ion Beam Deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magneto&#8208;transport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at. % Ni. Magnetometry and magneto&#8208;transport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magneto&#8208;resistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully&#8208;miscible elements.

         <title>Synthesis of MAPbBr3&#8208;Polymer Composite Films by Photolysis of DMF: Towards Transparent and Flexible Optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) with Hierarchical Multilevel Complexity</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physical entities with inherent randomness have been investigated as anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Herein, we demonstrate a transparent and flexible optical PUF label associated with multilevel complexity by taking advantage of the optical properties of hierarchical morphologies of the composite film composed of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles (MAPbBr3 NPs) and the intrinsic spinodal&#8208;decomposition&#8208;like phase separation of polymer blend (PMMA/PS blend). Due to the combinatorial effects of the photolysis synthesis of MAPbBr3 and the thermodynamic instability of the PMMA/PS blend, randomized patterns emerge at two&#8208;level scales. These patterns are intrinsically non&#8208;deterministic, and therefore, the PUF labels from the multilevel random patterns are challenging to replicate. This is mainly attributed to random spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within intricate bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns).

         <title>Interfacial Instability&#8208;Induced (3I) Adhesives through &#8220;Mediator&#8221; Solvent Diffusion for Robust Underoil Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Underoil adhesives are intensively needed in case of oil spill caused by pipeline rupture, but remain a challenge owing to the obstruction of oil layer or their swelling in oil. Herein, we demonstrate a general solvent diffusion principle by introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop a new type of interfacial instability&#8208;induced (3I) adhesives, achieving effective underoil adhesion on various substrates and blocking the oil leakage within seconds. Microscopic characterization reveals a fast and dynamic solvent exchange process that destroys the oil layer by liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial diffusion between &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents and oil, enabling 3I adhesives to contact solid surfaces directly. The principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next&#8208;generation adhesives in complex environments.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to create a wide variety of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, we report a new AM strategy, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8764;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

Abstract
Checkpoint immunotherapy holds great potential to treat malignancies via blocking the immunosuppressive signaling pathways, which however suffers from inefficiency and off&#8208;target adverse effects. We herein report checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) in combination with photodynamic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation to block checkpoint signaling pathways for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. These nano&#8208;PROTACs are composed of a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) and an Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (aPRO) via a caspase 3&#8208;cleavable segment. aPRO is activated by the increased expression of caspase 3 in tumor cells after phototherapeutic treatment and induces targeted degradation of SHP2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent depletion of SHP2 blocks the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), thus reinvigorating antitumor macrophages and T cells. Such a checkpoint PROTAC strategy synergizes immunogenic phototherapy to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, this study represents a generalized PROTAC platform to modulate immune&#8208;related signaling pathways for improved anticancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Checkpoint immunotherapy holds great potential to treat malignancies via blocking the immunosuppressive signaling pathways, which however suffers from inefficiency and off-target adverse effects. We herein report checkpoint nano-proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano-PROTACs) in combination with photodynamic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation to block checkpoint signaling pathways for activatable cancer photo-immunotherapy. These nano-PROTACs are composed of a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) and an Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)-targeting PROTAC peptide (aPRO) via a caspase 3-cleavable segment. aPRO is activated by the increased expression of caspase 3 in tumor cells after phototherapeutic treatment and induces targeted degradation of SHP2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The persistent depletion of SHP2 blocks the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt; and PD-1/PD-L1), thus reinvigorating antitumor macrophages and T cells.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordinated Pd Site within Amorphous Palladium Selenide for Active, Selective and Stable H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability are essential for the practical applications of H2O2 electrosynthesis technology, but it is still formidably challenging. We report that the low&#8208;coordinated structure of Pd sites in amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) can significantly boost the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Detailed investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the disordered arrangement of Pd atoms in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs can promote the activity, while the Pd sites with low&#8208;coordinated environment can optimize the adsorption towards oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to a significant enhancement in both the H2O2 selectivity and productivity. Impressively, a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C exhibits high H2O2 selectivity over 90% in different pH electrolytes. H2O2 productivities with ca. 3245.7, 1725.5, and 2242.1&#160;mmol gPd&#8211;1&#160;h&#8211;1 in 0.1&#160;M KOH, 0.1&#160;M HClO4, and 0.1&#160;M Na2SO4 can be achieved, respectively, in an H&#8208;cell electrolyzer, being a pH&#8208;universal catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical synthesis. Furthermore, the produced H2O2 can reach 1081.8&#160;ppm in a three&#8208;phase flow cell reactor after 2&#160;h enrichment in 0.1&#160;M Na2SO4, showing the great potential of a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>A Switchable One&#8208;Compound Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3, a material for the first one&#8208;compound diode is discovered. A temperature&#8208;gradient driven pn&#8208;junction is realized in a single crystal where p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conduction is accessed without external doping. The transition close to room temperature enables a variety of semiconductor applications.








Abstract
A diode requires the combination of p&#8208; and n&#8208;type semiconductors or at least the defined formation of such areas within a given compound. This is a prerequisite for any IT application, energy conversion technology, and electronic semiconductor devices. Since the discovery of the pnp&#8208;switchable compound Ag10Te4Br3 in 2009, it is in principle possible to fabricate a diode from a single material without adjusting the semiconduction type by a defined doping level. Often a structural phase transition accompanied by a dynamic change of charge carriers or a charge density wave within certain substructures are responsible for this effect. Unfortunately, the high pnp&#8208;switching temperature between 364 and 580 K hinders the application of this phenomenon in convenient devices. This effect is far removed from a suitable operation temperature at ambient conditions. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3&#160;is a room temperature pnp&#8208;switching material and the first single&#8208;material position&#8208;independent diode. It shows the highest ever reported Seebeck coefficient drop that takes place within a few Kelvin. Combined with its low thermal conductivity, it offers great application potential within an accessible and applicable temperature window. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3 and pnp&#8208;switching materials have the potential for applications and processes where diodes, transistors, or any defined charge separation with junction formation are utilized.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>&#8220;Enzyme&#8208;Like&#8221; Spatially Fixed Polyhydroxyl Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Hydrochromic Molecular Switching for Naked Eye Detection of ppm Level Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme-like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>Multiscale Polymeric Materials for Advanced Lithium Battery Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymeric materials indispensable to building safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density advanced batteries, in terms of electrode integrity, interface stability, and extending operational limits, are reviewed. The fundamental understanding of functional polymeric materials for advanced lithium battery chemistry and key research directions are discussed, thus suggesting design strategies for polymeric materials for advanced lithium batteries with improved electrochemical performances.








Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8208;metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the banner of &#8220;More than Moore,&#8221; the key to developing solution&#8208;processed semiconductor&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is to add additional functionality to a limited space. Molecular switches can induce transitions between metastable isomers by non&#8208;destructive stimuli, effectively amplifying the functionality of optoelectronic devices when embedded in semiconductors. This review categorizes and discusses molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded optoelectronic devices according to their operating mechanisms.








Abstract
Recent improvements in the performance of solution&#8208;processed semiconductor materials and optoelectronic devices have shifted research interest to the diversification/advancement of their functionality. Embedding a molecular switch capable of transition between two or more metastable isomers by light stimuli is one of the most straightforward and widely accepted methods to potentially realize the multifunctionality of optoelectronic devices. A molecular switch embedded in a semiconductor can effectively control various parameters such as trap&#8208;level, dielectric constant, electrical resistance, charge mobility, and charge polarity, which can be utilized in photoprogrammable devices including transistors, memory, and diodes. This review classifies the mechanism of each optoelectronic transition driven by molecular switches regardless of the type of semiconductor material or molecular switch or device. In addition, the basic characteristics of molecular switches and the persisting technical/scientific issues corresponding to each mechanism are discussed to help researchers. Finally, interesting yet infrequently reported applications of molecular switches and their mechanisms are also described.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Topology and Symmetry in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.
