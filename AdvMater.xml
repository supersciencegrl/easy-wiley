         <title>Construction of Interfacial Electric Field via Dual&#8208;porphyrin Heterostructure Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure is successfully constructed by coupling tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP) with tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP). The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1 is obtained for ZnTCPP/THPP under full spectrum, which is approximately 5.1 and 17.0 times higher than that of pure ZnTCPP and THPP, respectively. The significantly enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the giant interfacial electric field formed between dual porphyrins, which greatly facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, similar conjugated structures of dual porphyrins also provide proper interface match and decrease interface defects, thus inhibiting the recombination of photoproduced carriers. By rationally combining the appropriate band structures and high&#8208;quality interfacial contact of dual porphyrins, this work provides a fresh insight into the interfacial electric field construction to improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Mechanically Durable Memristor Arrays Based on a Discrete Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memristors constitute a promising functional component for information storage and in&#8208;memory computing in flexible and stretchable electronics including wearable devices, prosthetics and soft robotics. Despite tremendous efforts made to adapt conventional rigid memristors to flexible and stretchable scenarios, stretchable and mechanical damage endurable memristors have never been achieved, which is critical for maintaining reliable functions under unexpected mechanical attacks. Here, we reported the development of stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance based on a discreate structure design. Our memristors possess large stretchability (40%) and excellent deformability (half&#8208;fold), and retain stable performances under dynamic stretching and releasing. We show that our memristors maintain reliable functions and preserve information after extremely mechanical damages including punctures (up to 100 times) and serious torn situations (fully diagonal cut). Our structural strategy offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance, which is vital to achieve reliable functions for flexible and stretchable electronics even in extreme and highly dynamic environments.

         <title>Anionic Redox Regulated via Metal&#8211;Ligand Combinations in Layered Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing demand for energy storage is calling for improvements in cathode performance. In traditional layered cathodes, the higher energy of metal 3d over O 2p orbital results in one band cationic redox, capacity solely from cation can not meet the needs for higher energy density. Emerging anionic redox chemistry is promising to access higher capacity. In recent studies, low&#8208;lying O non&#8208;bonding 2p orbital was designed to activate one&#8208;band oxygen redox, but still accompanied by reversibility problems like oxygen loss, irreversible cation migration and voltage decay. Herein, by regulating metal&#8208;ligand energy level, both extra capacities provided by anionic redox and highly reversible anionic redox process were realized in NaCr1&#8208;yVyS2 system. The simultaneous cationic and anionic redox of Cr/V and S was observed by in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Under high d&#8208;p hybridization, the strong covalent interaction stabilized the electron holes on anions, prevented irreversible dimerization and cation migration, restrained voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of highly reversible anionic redox in layered compounds, and demonstrated the feasibility of anionic redox chemistry based on hybridized bands with d&#8208;p covalence.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here we develop an alternative biosensor transistor concept that relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8208;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically&#8208;engineered channel with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) antibody receptors, we demonstrate real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to aM concentrations in under two minutes in physiological relevant conditions.

         <title>Defect&#8208;free Metal Deposition on Two&#8208;dimensional Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here we show that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultra&#8208;thin 2D materials, and that it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nano&#8208;chemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. Our results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here we show that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. Our work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

         <title>Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Super Plasticity, Ultrafast Self&#8208;healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA&#8208;based gels are attractive materials as they allow intuitive rational design, respond to external physicochemical stimuli, and show great potential for biomedical applications. However, their relatively poor mechanical properties currently limit their technological application considerably as the latter requires mechanical integrity and tunability. With this work, we report a DNA organogel that gels through supramolecular interactions, which induce mesophase ordering, and that exhibits exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and biocompatibility. Moreover, the nature of the supramolecular bond enables complete self&#8208;healing within 3s. Most importantly, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths above 1&#160;MPa, stiffness higher than 20&#160;MPa, and toughness up to 18&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, rendering our materials the strongest among reported DNA networks. In addition, we demonstrate the facile access to composite DNA materials by blending magnetic nanoparticles with the organogel matrix giving access to magnetic field induced actuation. We believe that these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of DNA gels for their use in smart materials and biomedical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt (visible without tools) and covert (hidden and only visible with tools) technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by our proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the three&#8208;dimensional space, the multichannel image (multiplexed image) switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering by Remote Doping of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Leads to High&#8208;Performance IGZO/p&#8208;Si Heterostructure Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here we propose a strategy to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled monolayer based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si hetero&#8208;interfaced devices exhibit greatly enhanced photoresponsive characteristics, including a photo&#8208;switching current ratio with a hundredfold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects were investigated through comprehensive analysis with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and with a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors fabricated at a four&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale, and demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20,000 testing cycles.

LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, we present a multi&#8208;scale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8208;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of Intermediate&#8208;Temperature CO2 Interaction with Molten NaNO3 Salt Promoted MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The optimization of MgO&#8208;based adsorbents as advanced CO2 capture materials is predominantly focused on their molten salt modification for which theoretical and experimental contributions provide great insights for their high CO2&#8208;capture performance. The underlying mechanism of the promotion effect of the molten salt on CO2 capture, however, is a topic of controversy among several theoretical approaches. Herein, advanced experimental characterization techniques, including in situ eTEM, in situ CO2&#8208;DRIFTS, transient 18O&#8208;isotopic exchange, and Density Functional Theory are employed to elucidate the mechanism of CO2 interaction with molten salt&#8208;modified MgO in the 250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C range. Herein, eTEM studies using low (2&#8208;3 mbar) and high (700 mbar) CO2 pressures illustrate the dynamic evolution of the molten NaNO3 salt&#8208;promoted and unpromoted MgO carbonation with high magnification (&lt; 50&#160;nm). The formation of 18O&#8208;NaNO3 (use of 18O2), and that of C16O18O following CO2 interaction, verifies for the first time the proposed theoretical (DFT) reaction path: Conversion of NO3&#8211; (NO3&#8211; &#8594; NO2+ + O2&#8211;), adsorption of NO2+ on MgO with significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength, and formation of [Mg2+ &#8230; O2&#8211;] ion pairs preventing the development of an impermeable MgCO3 shell, which largely increases the rate of bulk MgO carbonation compared to the unmodified MgO.

         <title>Deciphering nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastomas uncovers an augmented antitumor effect of metronomic chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, we show that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endo&#8208;lysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which was not recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced&#8208;stage solid tumors.

         <title>Construction of Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 Heterostructures by Stepwise Topochemical Pathways for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Exploiting effective electrocatalysts based on elaborate heterostructures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been considered as a promising strategy for boosting water splitting efficiency to produce the clean&#160;energy&#8212;hydrogen. However, constructing catalytically active heterostructures with novel composition and architecture remains poorly developed due to the synthetic challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures, composed of single&#8208;crystalline Ni(CN)2 nanoplates surrounded by crystallographically aligned NiSe2 nanosatellites, can be created from nickel&#8208;based Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymers through stepwise topochemical pathways. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures show enhanced performance, which could be attributed to optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites endowed by the synergy between the two components. This work demonstrates a rational synthetic route for creating a novel Ni&#8208;based OER electrocatalyst that possesses nanoscale heterostructure, whose composition, spatial organization, and interface configuration can be finely manipulated.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanomicelles For the Topical Delivery of Aflibercept to Treat Retinal Neovascular Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a co&#8208;polymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal&#8208;scleral routes. EPC is comprised of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylglycol (PPG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept&#8208;loaded nEPCs (nEPCs+A) is capable of penetrating the cornea in ex&#8208;vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina of laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs+A also demonstrates biocompatibility in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti&#8208;VEGF drugs and the intrinsic anti&#8208;angiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti&#8208;VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight-threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a co-polymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal-scleral routes.

Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic anti-angiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti-VEGF drugs and the intrinsic anti-angiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti-VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) to produce ammonia (NH3) at ambient conditions is a promising alternative for the Haber&#8208;Bosch process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) to produce ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at ambient conditions is a promising alternative for the Haber-Bosch process. However, developing highly active and stable NRR catalysts to replace precious metals remains challenging. Herein, we report an unusual NRR electrocatalyst with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (Zn&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;N-C). The Zn&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;N-C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of &#8764;16.1&#160;&#956;g NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at -0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon-based NRR electrocatalysts in which the transition metal is dispersed atomically and anchored at nitrogen (TM-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) sites. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Structural characterizations reveal that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moieties serve as real active sites, and nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR activity. In situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate-limiting step toward NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generation.

         <title>High Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>

Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, we developed a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8764; 60 &#956;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination&#8208;induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photo&#8208;readable memory. Potentially, our novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including in&#8208;memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side&#8208;chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.








Abstract
Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide&#8208;bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low&#8208;cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Dramatically Enhanced Valley&#8208;Polarized Emission of Monolayer WS2 at Room Temperature with Plasmonic Archimedes Spiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have intrinsic valley degrees of freedom, making them appealing for exploiting valleytronic applications in information storage and processing. WS2 monolayer possesses two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, each valley coupling selectively with a circular polarization of light. The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS2. Here, we report efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized PL from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8208;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures. The DVP of WS2 at RT can be enhanced from &lt;&#160;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS2. For CPL on WS2&#8208;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum&#8208;dependent long&#8208;range electron&#8208;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrical tunibility in the valley&#8208;polarized emission from WS2&#8208;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy towards harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.

         <title>Suppressing Step Effect of 3D Printing for Constructing Contact Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing has been considered as a sustainable method to construct complicated 3D structures. However, step effect induced by the traditional point&#8208;by&#8208;point or layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing mode, inevitably occurs and remains an obstacle to realizing the smoothness and uniformity of 3D samples. Here, we propose a continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy to fabricate high&#8208;precision 3D structures based on the digital light processing (DLP) technology. With the control of the confinement of the liquid&#8208;solid interface and the continuous printing mode, liquid film adhering to the cured structure is sucked into the cured layer structures with excess resin adhering to the cured structure scraping off, where the step effect is eliminated and post&#8208;washing is avoided. The morphology and dimension of the confined liquid film can be well regulated by ink properties and printing parameters to optimize the surface smoothness and printing fidelity. In addition, heat accumulation and thermal diffusion are also suppressed, ensuring the long&#8208;term printing stability. Centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with central thickness of &#8764; 135&#160;&#956;m comparable to the commercial ones can be printed, which possesses extreme smoothness (sub 1.3&#160;nm), homogeneous mechanical characteristic, biocompatibility and high optical property with imaging resolution of up to 228.1 lp/mm.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity, Multiband Electronic Structure and High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in TlCuSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting in understanding thermoelectric energy conversion. TlCuSe exhibiting intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), a high power factor (11.6 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), and a high figure of merit ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described.








Abstract
The entanglement of lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient complicates the process of optimizing thermoelectric performance in most thermoelectric materials. Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting and practically important for energy conversion. Herein, an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor TlCuSe that has an intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), a high power factor (11.6&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and a high figure of merit, ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described. The weak chemical bonds, originating from the filled antibonding orbitals p&#8208;d* within the edge&#8208;sharing CuSe4 tetrahedra and long Tl&#63743;Se bonds in the PbClF&#8208;type structure, in conjunction with the large atomic mass of Tl lead to an ultralow sound velocity. Strong anharmonicity, coming from Tl+ lone&#8208;pair electrons, boosts phonon&#8211;phonon scattering rates and further suppresses lattice thermal conductivity. The multiband character of the valence band structure contributing to power factor enhancement benefits from the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Tl+ as well, which modify the orbital character of the valence bands, and pushes the valence band maximum off the &#915;&#8208;point, increasing the band degeneracy. The results provide new insight on the rational design of thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Additives for Ambient 3D Printing with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of commercially relevant acrylics and concomitant 3D printing under ambient conditions is made possible with thiol additives acting as oxygen scavengers. The tadpole and frog are 3D printed using energy efficient red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), metaphorically representing the transformative advance that allows additive manufacturing (or breathing for the frog) in air.








Abstract
With 3D printing, the desire is to be &#8220;limited only by imagination,&#8221; and although remarkable advancements have been made in recent years, the scope of printable materials remains narrow compared to other forms of manufacturing. Light&#8208;driven polymerization methods for 3D printing are particularly attractive due to unparalleled speed and resolution, yet the reliance on high&#8208;energy UV/violet light in contemporary processes limits the number of compatible materials due to pervasive absorption, scattering, and degradation at these short wavelengths. Such issues can be addressed with visible&#8208;light photopolymerizations. However, these lower&#8208;energy methods often suffer from slow reaction times and sensitivity to oxygen, precluding their utility in 3D printing processes that require rapid hardening (curing) to maximize build speed and resolution. Herein, multifunctional thiols are identified as simple additives to enable rapid high&#8208;resolution visible&#8208;light 3D printing under ambient (atmospheric O2) conditions that rival modern UV/violet&#8208;based technology. The present process is universal, providing access to commercially relevant acrylic resins with a range of disparate mechanical responses from strong and stiff to soft and extensible. Pushing forward, the insight presented within this study will inform the development of next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;printing materials, such as multicomponent hydrogels and composites.

         <title>Direct Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Porous Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Membranes with High Gas Permeances and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous single&#8208;layer graphene membranes for gas separation are synthesized by one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Highly dense gas&#8208;sieving pores are created in graphene by tuning the CVD parameters. The resulting graphene membranes exhibit record&#8208;high H2/CH4 separation performance to date: H2/CH4 selectivity &gt;&#160;2000 while H2 permeance &gt;&#160;4000 GPU.








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer graphene containing molecular&#8208;sized in&#8208;plane pores is regarded as a promising membrane material for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to its atomic thickness and low gas transport resistance. However, typical etching&#8208;based pore generation methods cannot decouple pore nucleation and pore growth, resulting in a trade&#8208;off between high areal pore density and high selectivity. In contrast, intrinsic pores in graphene formed during chemical vapor deposition are not created by etching. Therefore, intrinsically porous graphene can exhibit high pore density while maintaining its gas selectivity. In this work, the density of intrinsic graphene pores is systematically controlled for the first time, while appropriate pore sizes for gas sieving are precisely maintained. As a result, single&#8208;layer graphene membranes with the highest H2/CH4 separation performances recorded to date (H2 permeance &gt;&#160;4000 GPU and H2/CH4 selectivity &gt;&#160;2000) are fabricated by manipulating growth temperature, precursor concentration, and non&#8208;covalent decoration of the graphene surface. Moreover, it is identified that nanoscale molecular fouling of the graphene surface during gas separation where graphene pores are partially blocked by hydrocarbon contaminants under experimental conditions, controls both selectivity and temperature dependent permeance. Overall, the direct synthesis of porous single&#8208;layer graphene exploits its tremendous potential as high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;sieving membranes.

         <title>Suppressing Interface Strain for Eliminating Double&#8208;Slope Behaviors: Towards Ideal Conformable Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface strain between film and substrate is first found to play the crucial role in determining device ideality. The release of strain by peeling can reduce the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, which decreases oxygen doped carriers, thereby realizing ideal polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs). The work clarifies the effect of interface strain on the device ideality, offering useful guidance for constructing ideal conformable PFETs.








Abstract
High&#8208;mobility polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) are being actively explored for applications in soft electronic skin and low&#8208;cost flexible displays because of their superior solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and stretchability. However, most of high&#8208;mobility PFETs often deviate from the idealized behavior with variable mobility, large threshold voltage, and high off&#8208;state current, which masks their intrinsic properties and significantly impedes their practical applications. Here, it is first revealed that interface strain between polymer thin film and rigid substrate plays a crucial role in determining the ideality of PFETs, and demonstrate that various ideal conformable PFETs can be successfully fabricated by releasing strain. It is found that strain in film can be released by one&#8208;step peeling strategy, which can reduce &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and suppress generation of oxygen doped carriers, thereby obtaining linearly injected charge carriers and decreased carrier concentration in channel, eventually realizing ideal PFETs. More impressively, the fabricated ideal conformable PFET array displays outstanding conformability to curved objects, and meanwhile showing excellent organic light&#8208;emitting display driving capability. The work clarifies the effect of the interface strain on the device ideality, and strain can be effectively released by a facile peeling strategy, thus offering useful guidance for the construction of ideal conformable PFETs.

A new concept of innovative transmission cavities combined with organic photodetectors (OPDs) is proposed to achieve narrowband photodetection from the VIS to the NIR region. With this approach, an ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones is achieved and is integrated into a miniaturized spectrometer, representing a significant step toward applying OPDs as an attractive alternative for mobile spectrometric sensing.








Abstract
Spectroscopic photodetection plays a key role in many emerging applications such as context&#8208;aware optical sensing, wearable biometric monitoring, and biomedical imaging. Photodetectors based on organic semiconductors open many new possibilities in this field. However, ease of processing, tailorable optoelectronic properties, and sensitivity for faint light are still significant challenges. Here, the authors report a novel concept for a tunable spectral detector by combining an innovative transmission cavity structure with organic absorbers to yield narrowband organic photodetection in the wavelength range of 400&#8211;1100&#160;nm, fabricated in a full&#8208;vacuum process. Benefiting from this strategy, one of the best performed narrowband organic photodetectors is achieved with a finely wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponse (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of &#8776;40&#160;nm), ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones, the maximum response speed of 555&#160;kHz, and a large dynamic range up to 168&#160;dB. Particularly, an array of transmission cavity organic photodetectors is monolithically integrated on a small substrate to showcase a miniaturized spectrometer application, and a true proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept transmission spectrum measurement is successfully demonstrated. The excellent performance, the simple device fabrication as well as the possibility of high integration of this new concept challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;noise silicon photodetectors and will mature the spectroscopic photodetection into technological realities.

         <title>Crystallographic&#8208;Site&#8208;Specific Structural Engineering Enables Extraordinary Electrochemical Performance of High&#8208;Voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering is performed on the cathode material structure for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming at the root causes of the instability based on the fundamental structure/function relationship. The high&#8208;voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode with Fd3&#175;m space group symmetry is employed as a representative, of which two issue&#8208;involved crystallographic sites are directly and simultaneously addressed, contributing to an extraordinarily excellent battery performance.








Abstract
The development of reliable and safe high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by the structural instability of cathode materials during cycling, arising as a result of detrimental phase transformations occurring at high operating voltages alongside the loss of active materials induced by transition metal dissolution. Originating from the fundamental structure/function relation of battery materials, the authors purposefully perform crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering on electrode material structure, using the high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode as a representative, which directly addresses the root source of structural instability of the Fd3&#175;m structure. By employing Sb as a dopant to modify the specific issue&#8208;involved 16c and 16d sites simultaneously, the authors successfully transform the detrimental two&#8208;phase reaction occurring at high&#8208;voltage into a preferential solid&#8208;solution reaction and significantly suppress the loss of Mn from the LNMO structure. The modified LNMO material delivers an impressive 99% of its theoretical specific capacity at 1 C, and maintains 87.6% and 72.4% of initial capacity after 1500 and 3000 cycles, respectively. The issue&#8208;tracing site&#8208;specific structural tailoring demonstrated for this material will facilitate the rapid development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Nanosecond&#8208;Pulsed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed pulsed operation of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two&#8208;fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&#8722;1m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
While metal&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high&#8208;speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.3 kA cm&#8722;2, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&#8722;2, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Finally, integrated distributed feedback (DFB) gratings are explored, which facilitate more directional light emission with a maximum radiance of approximately 1200 kW&#8197;sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2, a more than two&#8208;fold enhancement to forward radiation output.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Responsive Microneedle Robots for Intestinal Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle&#8208;structured robots are developed by a building&#8208;block stacking inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. Such microrobots contain a polarized magnetic substrate for remote guidance, needle tips for intestinal drug release, and a separable connection for tip&#8211;substrate detachment and substrate excretion. These microrobots perform well in delivering insulin to pigs and blood glucose control, indicating their potentials in effective oral macromolecule administration.








Abstract
Oral administration is the most convenient and commonly used approach for drug delivery, while it is still a challenge to overcome the complicated gastrointestinal barriers and realize efficient macromolecular drug absorption. Here, novel magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle robots are presented for efficient oral delivery of versatile macromolecules. These microneedle robots with three components of the magnetic substrate, the separable connection, and tips are generated by a Lego&#8208;brick&#8208;stacking&#8208;inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. With the assistance of commercial enteric capsule encapsulation, they can be taken orally and be released when entering the small intestine. Benefitting from their polarized magnetic substrate, the tips of the microneedle robots can orient to the small intestinal wall, overcome the barriers, insert into the tissue, and deliver encapsulated actives under specific magnetic fields. Besides, after the separable connection degrades, the tips can be left inside the tissue for continuous actives release, and the magnetic substrate can be excreted safely. Based on these features, the practical values of the microneedle robots are demonstrated by using them to orally deliver insulin and efficiently regulate the blood glucose of pigs. It is believed that the proposed microneedle robots can orally deliver diverse macromolecules and thus open a new chapter for oral administration.

         <title>Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Crystal Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation has become the main issue in the field of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. A crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites induced by a solid&#8208;state reaction to achieve defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite is demonstrated. Finally, the defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI3 inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid&#8208;state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI3 perovskite. Upon solid&#8208;state reaction, the Br&#8722; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI3 perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb2+ and conduct certain solid&#8208;state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs+ cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI3. The as&#8208;achieved defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3 not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability. Finally, the CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability. Overall, this work proposes a novel concept of defect compensation in inorganic perovskites through crystal secondary growth induced by solid&#8208;state reaction that is promising for various optoelectronic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defect-triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid-state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. Upon solid-state reaction, the Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and conduct certain solid-state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The as-achieved defect-compensated CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability.

         <title>Robust Jumping Actuator with a Shrimp&#8208;Shell Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is highly desirable to develop compact and robust jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. In this work, a film jumping actuator is reported, which exhibits shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate.








Abstract
It is highly desirable to develop compact&#8208; and robust&#8208;film jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. Besides, the demands for strong actuation force, large bending curvature in a short response time, and good environmental tolerance are significant challenges to the material design. To address these challenges, this paper reports the fabrication of a thin&#8208;film jumping actuator, which exhibits a shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) that is connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures the fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate. The actuator does not exhibit shape distortion at temperatures of up to 225&#160;&#176;C and in concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as when immersed in many organic solvents. This work avails a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance actuators that function under harsh and complicated conditions.

         <title>Dendritic CsSnI3 for Efficient and Flexible Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The injection and transport capacity of holes is significantly stronger than electrons in CsSnI3&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes; therefore, the charge injection is manipulated by preparing a dendritic CsSnI3 structure, increasing the interface area of the perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter and the probability of radiative recombination. As a result, an efficient device is achieved with a record external quantum efficiency of 5.4%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 is emerging as one of the most promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs), which find practical applications including facial recognition, biomedical apparatus, night vision camera, and Light Fidelity. However, in the CsSnI3&#8208;based Pero&#8208;LEDs, the holes injection is significantly higher than that of electrons, resulting in unbalanced charge injection, undesired exciton dissipation, and poor device performance. Herein, it is proposed to manage charge injection and recombination behavior by tuning the interface area of perovskite and charge&#8208;transporter. A dendritic CsSnI3 structure is prepared on the hole&#8208;transporter, only making a bottom contact with the hole&#8208;transporter and exposing all other available crystal surfaces to the electron&#8208;transporter. In other words, the interface area of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter is significantly higher than that of perovskite/hole&#8208;transporter. Moreover, the embedding interface of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter can spatially confine holes and electrons, increasing the radiation recombination. By taking advantage of the dendritic structure, efficient lead&#8208;free NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs are achieved with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.4%. More importantly, the dendritic structure shows great superiorities in flexible devices, for there is almost no morphology change after 2000&#8208;cycles of bends, and the fabricated Pero&#8208;LEDs can keep 93.4% of initial EQEs after 50&#8208;cycles of bends.

         <title>Secondary Bonding Channel Design Induces Intercalation Pseudocapacitance toward Ultrahigh&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional organic electrodes rely on functional groups. In this work, the organic compound 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid is used as an example to reveal that secondary bonds for molecular stacking are connected together to form 3D channels for Li+&#8208;ion intercalation. The secondary bonding channels comprising &#63743;C&#63742;C&#63743; redox sites are identified to display intercalation pseudocapacitance, playing an important role in increasing specific capacity and rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials have shown extraordinary promise for green and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, but usually suffer from low specific capacity and poor rate capability, which is largely caused by inactive components and diffusion&#8208;controlled Li+ intercalation. Herein, high&#8208;rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors&#8217; combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first&#8208;principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four&#8208;electron redox reaction at conventional &#63743;C&#63742;O and &#63743;C&#63742;N groups and a six&#8208;electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (&#63743;H2NC5&#63743;H&#8943;O&#63742;C(OH)&#63743;) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (&#63743;C5H3N&#8943;NH3C5&#63743;). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8&#160;V high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density BPDCA anode&#8208;based hybrid Li&#8208;ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

         <title>Monolayer Support Control and Precise Colloidal Nanocrystals Demonstrate Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between coexisting metal and metal oxide phases determine the properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Atomic layer deposition and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis are combined to precisely control catalyst properties with sub&#8208;nanometer precision. Significant enhancements are observed in methane combustion activity after modification of SiO2 support with only one monolayer of Al2O3, and surface versus bulk contributions of metal&#8211;support interactions are explored.








Abstract
Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer&#8208;controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub&#8208;nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd&#8208;catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al2O3/SiO2 spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al2O3 layer thicknesses ranging from sub&#8208;monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al2O3 situated at the Pd/Al2O3 interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al2O3 interface up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.

     alt="Monolayer Support Control and Precise Colloidal Nanocrystals Demonstrate Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions between coexisting metal and metal oxide phases determine the properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Atomic layer deposition and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis are combined to precisely control catalyst properties with sub-nanometer precision. Significant enhancements are observed in methane combustion activity after modification of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support with only one monolayer of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and surface versus bulk contributions of metal&#8211;support interactions are explored.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer-controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub-nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd-catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer thicknesses ranging from sub-monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; situated at the Pd/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface up layer-by-layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Congener&#8208;Induced Sulfur&#8208;Related Metabolism Interference Therapy Promoted by Photothermal Sensitization for Combating Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial anti&#8208;implant&#8208;associated infection therapy named congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy is proposed, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners. The original nanodrug MnSe2 is devised to generate permeable H2Se into bacteria and eliminated them by specific destruction of metabolic homeostasis with the promotion of photothermal sensitization.








Abstract
Metabolic homeostasis is vital for individual cells to keep alive. Stronger metabolic homeostasis allows bacteria to survive in vivo and do persistent harm to hosts, which is especially typical in implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) with biofilm intervention. Herein, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners, a congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy (SMIT) eradicating IAI is proposed by specific destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The original nanodrug manganese diselenide (MnSe2) is devised to generate permeable H2Se in bacteria, triggered by the acidic microenvironment. H2Se, the congener substitution of H2S, as a bacteria&#8208;specific intermediate metabolite, can embed itself into the H2S&#8208;utilization pathway and further alternatively disrupt the downstream sulfur&#8208;related metabolism state inside bacteria. A proteomic study indicates ribosome&#8208;related proteins are heavily downregulated and the basic metabolic pathways are mainly disordered after SMIT, revealing the destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The efficiency of SMIT is significantly promoted with the mild temperature sensitization provided by the photothermal treatment (PTT) of MnSe2 nanoparticles, verified by the proteomic study and the anti&#8208;IAI effect in vitro and in vivo. With the intelligent nanodrug, a PTT&#8208;promoted SMIT strategy against IAI is provided and a new insight into the interference design toward metabolic homeostasis with biochemical similarity is demonstrated.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Deformation&#8208;Recoverable and Broadband Sound&#8208;Absorbing Microlattice Inspired by the Concept of Traditional Perforated Panels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on traditional perforated panel concepts, a novel broadband sound&#8208;absorbing microlattice with impact&#8208;recovery multifunctionality is presented. The microlattice boasts high averaged absorption coefficients of 0.77 with mechanisms attributing to synergistic impedance matching and a combination of viscous, thermal, and structural damping dissipation. It is also pseudo&#8208;reusable with high strain recovery at 30% with no degradation of sound absorption observed.








Abstract
Noise pollution is a highly detrimental daily health hazard. Sound absorbers, such as the traditionally used perforated panels, find widespread applications. Nonetheless, modern product designs call for material novelties with enhanced performance and multifunctionality. The advent of additive manufacturing has brought about the possibilities of functional materials design to be based on structures rather than chemistry. With this in mind, herein, the traditional concept of perforated panels is revisited and is incorporated with additive manufacturing for the development of a novel microlattice&#8208;based sound absorber with additional impact resistance multifunctionality. The structurally optimized microlattice presents excellent broadband absorption with an averaged experimental absorption coefficient of 0.77 across a broad frequency range from 1000 to 6300&#160;Hz. Extensive simulation and experiments reveal absorption mechanisms to be based on viscous flow, thermal and structural damping dissipations while broadband capabilities to be on multiple resonance modes working in tandem. High deformation recovery up to 30% strain is also possible from the strut&#8208;based design and viscoelasticity of the base material. Overall, the excellent properties of the microlattice overcome tradeoffs commonly found in conventional absorbers. Additionally, this work aims to present a new paradigm: revisiting old concepts for the developments of novel materials using contemporary methods.

         <title>Ultrafast Interlayer Charge Separation, Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption, and Tunable Overpotential in Twisted Graphitic Carbon Nitride Bilayers for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking g&#8208;C3N4 as a representative example, it is theoretically found that twisted bilayers are endowed with good charge separation, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer, and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption. Due to the induced large moir&#233; potentials, the overpotentials of HER and OER on the twisted bilayers are significantly reduced. Therefore, twist is better and of great potential in catalysis.








Abstract
Moir&#233; pattern superlattice formed by 2D van der Waals layered structures have attracted great attention for diverse applications. In experiments, the enhancement of catalytic performance in twisted bilayer systems is reported while its mechanism remains unclear. From high&#8208;accuracy first&#8208;principles and time&#8208;dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer within 120 fs, excellent charge separation, improved visible&#8208;light absorption, and satisfactory overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in twisted graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) bilayers are found, which are beneficial to photocatalytic, photo&#8208;electrocatalytic, or electrocatalytic water splitting. This work provides insightful guidance to advanced nanocatalysis based on twisted layered materials.

         <title>Atomic Scale Control and Visualization of Topological Quantum Phase Transition in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Driven by Their Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state. A pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, atomic manipulation with scanning tunneling microscopy allows for engineering polymers.








Abstract
Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) driven by quantum fluctuations are transitions between distinct quantum phases of matter. At present, they are poorly understood and not readily controlled. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) are used to explore atomic scale control over quantum phase transitions between two different topological quantum states of a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The phase transition is driven by a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that is activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long&#8208;lasting coherent fluctuations between the polymer's two quantum phases near the phase transition, at finite temperature. This work thus presents a new way of exploring atomic&#8208;scale control over QPTs and indicates that emerging quantum criticality in the vicinity of a QPT can give rise to new states of organic matter.

         <title>Multichannel Piezo&#8208;Ultrasound Implant with Hybrid Waterborne Acoustic Metastructure for Selective Wireless Energy Transfer at Megahertz Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is proposed, which integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure, multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The optimized device structure that utilizes a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator provides the advantage of ultrasound frequency selectivity for in vivo multifunctional operations.








Abstract
Ultrasound energy transfer (UET) is developed and integrated into various bioelectronics with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities. However, existing UET platforms generally enable one function at a time due to the single ultrasound channel architecture, limiting the full potential of bioelectronics that requires multicontrol modes. Here, a multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is presented that integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure (HWAM), multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The HWAM that utilizes both a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator is optimized to provide the advantage of ultrasound selectivity at megahertz frequencies. Complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, frequency&#8208;controlled multifunctional operations, such as wireless charging (&#8776;11.08 &#181;W) at 3.3&#160;MHz and high&#8208;sensitivity wireless switch/control (threshold &#8776;0.55&#160;MPa) of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode/motor at 1&#160;MHz, are demonstrated ex vivo using porcine tissue and in vivo in a rat. The developed MC&#8208;PUI enhances UET versatility and opens up a new pathway for wireless implant design.

         <title>A Bioinspired Stretchable Sensory&#8208;Neuromorphic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel form of stretchable integrated system, namely a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, is presented, which comprises an artificial mechanoreceptor, an artificial synapse, and an epidermal photonic actuator as three devices. This system features a bioinspired sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system entailing tactile sensing, pattern learning/inferencing, and visualizing feedback information.








Abstract
Conventional stretchable electronics that adopt a wavy design, a neutral mechanical plane, and conformal contact between abiotic and biotic interfaces have exhibited diverse skin&#8208;interfaced applications. Despite such remarkable progress, the evolution of intelligent skin prosthetics is challenged by the absence of the monolithic integration of neuromorphic constituents into individual sensing and actuating components. Herein, a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, comprising an artificial mechanoreceptor, artificial synapse, and epidermal photonic actuator is demonstrated; these three biomimetic functionalities correspond to a stretchable capacitive pressure sensor, a resistive random&#8208;access memory, and a quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode, respectively. This system features a rigid&#8208;island structure interconnected with a sinter&#8208;free printable conductor, which is optimized by controlling the evaporation rate of solvent (&#8776;160% stretchability and &#8776;18&#160;550 S cm&#8722;1 conductivity). Devised design improves both areal density and structural reliability while avoiding the thermal degradation of heat&#8208;sensitive stretchable electronic components. Moreover, even in the skin deformation range, the system accurately recognizes various patterned stimuli via an artificial neural network with training/inferencing functions. Therefore, the new bioinspired system is expected to be an important step toward implementing intelligent wearable electronics.

         <title>A Cascade Battery: Coupling Two Sequential Electrochemical Reactions in a Single Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. It can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber than traditional batteries and bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, paving a way for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.








Abstract
Currently, rechargeable electrochemical batteries generally operate on one reversible electrochemical reaction during discharging and charging cycles. Here, a cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. Such a concept is demonstrated in an aqueous Zn&#8211;S hybrid battery, where solid sulfur serves as the cathode in the first discharge step and the generated Cu2S catalyzes Cu2+ reduce to Cu/Cu2O to provide the second discharge step. The cascade battery shows many merits compared to traditional batteries. First, it integrates two batteries internally, eliminating the use of additional inactive connecting materials required for external integration. Second, it can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber of the battery than traditional batteries. Third, cascade battery can bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. An ultrahigh areal capacity of 48&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved even at a low solid cathode loading (9.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, providing a paradigm for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.

         <dc:description>
Monolithic fabrication of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) is demonstrated by in situ growth of laser&#8208;induced graphene electrodes with different hydrophobicity in a fluorinated ethylene propylene&#8208;coated polyimide bilayer structure. The DEG exhibits high power conversion efficiency, lighting up 480 LEDs with one water droplet. More importantly, the DEG exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) has emerged as a promising and versatile method for high&#8208;throughput graphene patterning; however, its full potential in creating complex structures and devices for practical applications is yet to be explored. In this study, an in&#8208;situ growing LIG process that enables to pattern superhydrophobic fluorine&#8208;doped graphene on fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) is demonstrated. This method leverages on distinct spectral responses of FEP and PI during laser excitation to generate the environment preferentially for LIG formation, eliminating the need for multistep processes and specific atmospheres. The structured and water&#8208;repellant structures rendered by the spectral&#8208;tuned interfacial LIG process are suitable as the electrode for the construction of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power density of 47.5 W m&#8722;2 from the impact of a water droplet 105&#160;&#181;L from a height of 25&#160;cm. Importantly, the device exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions. The facile process developed can be extended to realize various functional devices.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading.

Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti&#8208;bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single&#8208;atom Ti&#8208;embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single&#8208;atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area&#8208;sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A descriptor, the &lt;i&gt;d&#8211;p&lt;/i&gt; hybridization state between single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large-sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

By comparison of three different boron dipyrromethene compounds, the heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free 10&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;dipyrrolo[1,2&#8208;c:2&#8220;,1&#8221; f][1,3,2] diazaborinin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&#8208;5&#8208;uide is used for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy, in which the anthracene module is able to capture singlet oxygen with laser irradiation and release it in dark conditions for &#8220;afterglow&#8221; photodynamic therapy, leading to the complete suppression of tumors.








Abstract
Improving singlet oxygen (1O2) lifespan by fractionated delivery in dark and hypoxic conditions is a better way to achieve enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, three boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are synthesized to demonstrate that anthracence&#8208;functionalized BODIPY, namely ABDPTPA is an efficient heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer for the reversible capture and release of 1O2. The spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing of ABDPTPA promises a high 1O2 quantum yield of 60% in dichloromethane. Under light irradiation, the anthracene group reacts with 1O2 to produce endoperoxide. Interestingly, after termination of irradiation, the endoperoxide undergoes thermal cycloreversion to produce 1O2, and regenerates the anthracene module to achieve 1O2 &#8220;afterglow,&#8221; which results in a prolonged half lifetime of 1O2 for 9.2&#160;min. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles have a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.6&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 on U87MG cells. Further, the results of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles can inhibit tumor proliferation even at a low dose (200&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1, 100&#160;&#181;L) without any side effects. Therefore, the study provides a generalized 1O2 &#8220;afterglow&#8221; strategy to enhance phototheranostics for complete tumor regression.

         <title>Molecular Ferroelectric&#8208;Based Flexible Sensors Exhibiting Supersensitivity and Multimodal Capability for Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
[C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;polyurethane flexible sensors feature a series of unique characteristic including self&#8208;powering, high sensitivity, and excellent durability. A comprehensive scaling analysis along with computational modeling provides insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes the rules of engineering design and optimization for the molecular ferroelectric&#8208;based flexible sensors.








Abstract
Although excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties matched with or even surpassing those of ferroelectric ceramics have been recently discovered in molecular ferroelectrics, their successful applications in devices are scarce. The fracture proneness of molecular ferroelectrics under mechanical loading precludes their applications as flexible sensors in bulk crystalline form. Here, self&#8208;powered flexible mechanical sensors prepared from the facile deposition of molecular ferroelectric [C(NH2)3]ClO4 onto a porous polyurethane (PU) matrix are reported. [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU is capable of detecting pressure of 3&#160;Pa and strain of 1% that are hardly accessible by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoelectric, triboelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, and presents the ability of sensing multimodal mechanical forces including compression, stretching, bending, shearing, and twisting with high cyclic stability. This scaling analysis corroborated with computational modeling provides detailed insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes rules of engineering design and optimization for the hybrid sponges. Demonstrative applications of the [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU array suggest potential uses in interactive electronics and robotic systems.

         <title>Efficient Ion Sieving in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;Nanometer Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>

Ultrathin covalent organic framework membranes are constructed, where abundant hydrogen bonding sites are lined in the 1D sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm sized channels. The hydrogen&#8208;bond binding interaction between the hydrogen bonding sites and hydrated divalent cations are stronger than that of monovalent cations, enabling efficient metal ion sieving driven by the concentration gradient.








Abstract
Membranes of sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer channels show high ion transport rates, but it remains a great challenge to design such membranes with desirable ion selectivities for ion separation applications. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with a channel size of &#8776;1.4&#160;nm and abundant hydrogen bonding sites, exhibiting efficient ion sieving properties are demonstrated. The COF membranes have high monovalent cation permeation rates of 0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and extremely low multivalent cation permeabilities, leading to high monovalent over divalent ion selectivities for K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;765, Na+/Mg2+ of &#8776;680, and Li+/Mg2+ of &#8776;217. Experimental measurements and theoretical simulations reveal that the hydrogen bonding interaction between hydrated cations and the COF channel wall governs the high selectivity, and divalent cations transport through the channel needs to overcome higher energy barriers than monovalent cations. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer sized membranes with specific interaction sites for high&#8208;efficiency ionic separation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material strategies and design concepts, including holey architectures, precurved layouts, and structured hydrogel adhesives, are introduced for thin, soft wireless devices that can continuously monitor vital signs in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. They enable mechanical and geometrical advantages, soft release of devices from the skin, improved permeability, and visual inspection of the skin through holes.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of vital signs is an essential aspect of operations in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), of particular importance to extremely premature and/or critically ill patients. Current approaches require multiple sensors taped to the skin and connected via hard&#8208;wired interfaces to external data acquisition electronics. The adhesives can cause iatrogenic injuries to fragile, underdeveloped skin, and the wires can complicate even the most routine tasks in patient care. Here, materials strategies and design concepts are introduced that significantly improve these platforms through the use of optimized materials, open (i.e., &#8220;holey&#8221;) layouts and precurved designs. These schemes 1) reduce the stresses at the skin interface, 2) facilitate release of interfacial moisture from transepidermal water loss, 3) allow visual inspection of the skin for rashes or other forms of irritation, 4) enable triggered reduction of adhesion to reduce the probability for injuries that can result from device removal. A combination of systematic benchtop testing and computational modeling identifies the essential mechanisms and key considerations. Demonstrations on adult volunteers and on a neonate in an operating NICUs illustrate a broad range of capabilities in continuous, clinical&#8208;grade monitoring of conventional vital signs, and unconventional indicators of health status.

         <title>Chaotic Organic Crystal Phosphorescent Patterns for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The phosphorescent patterns on the MoS2 seem similar on the macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, the encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment.








Abstract
Since the 4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things based environments have been widely used in various fields ranging from mobile to medical devices. Simultaneously, information leakage and hacking risks have also increased significantly, and secure authentication and security systems are constantly required. Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are in the spotlight as an alternative. Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and atomic seed heterostructure for security labels with PUFs. Phosphorescent organic crystal patterns are formed on MoS2. They seem similar on a macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment with lengths of 25&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, security labels with phosphorescent PUFs can offer superior randomness and no&#8208;cloning codes, possibly becoming a promising security strategy for authentication processes.

         <title>Controllable Solution&#8208;Phase Epitaxial Growth of Q1D Sb2(S,Se)3/CdS Heterojunction Solar Cell with 9.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar cell device based on (hk1)&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)S3 grown on top of hexagonal CdS is successfully prepared. The enhanced device performance is attributed not only to the faster charge transport along the vertically oriented (Sb4X6)n ribbons, but also to the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction owing to the formation of favorable covalent bond at the junction.








Abstract
Antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is a promising photoabsorber for stable and high efficiency thin film photovoltaics (PV). The unique quasi&#8208;1D (Q1D) crystal structure gives Sb2(S,Se)3 intriguing anisotropic optoelectronic properties, which intrinsically require the optimization of crystal growth orientation, especially for electronic devices with vertical charge transport such as solar cells. Although the efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells has been improved greatly through optimizing the material quality, the fundamental issue of crystal orientation control in polycrystalline films remains unsolved, resulting in charge carrier recombination losses in the device. Herein, the epitaxial growth of vertically&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)3 film on hexagonal CdS is successfully realized via a solution&#8208;based synergistic crystal growth process. The crystallographic orientation relationship between Sb2(S,Se)3 light absorber and the CdS substrate has been rigorously investigated. The best performing Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 9.2% owing to the faster charge transport in the bulk and the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction. This study points to a new direction to control the crystal growth of mixed&#8208;anion Sb2(S,Se)3, which is crucial to achieve high efficiency solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides with low dimensionality.

         <title>Superior Sodium Storage Properties in the Anode Material NiCr2S4 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: An X&#8208;ray Diffraction, Pair Distribution Function, and X&#8208;ray Absorption Study Reveals a Conversion Mechanism via Nickel Extrusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results of an extensive study of pseudo&#8208;layered NiCr2S4 as an anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries are reported. Electrochemical and kinetic characteristics, X&#8208;ray absorption, diffraction, and total&#8208;scattering experiments evidence a complex and unusual charge storage mechanism: nickel extrusion and sodium insertion via formation of a NaCrS2 intermediate followed by the full conversion to nanocrystalline Ni0, Cr0, and Na2S is observed.








Abstract
The pseudo&#8208;layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 is observed at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 in the potential window 3.0&#8211;0.1&#160;V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface&#8208;controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0&#8211;0.3&#160;V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3&#8208;type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long&#8208;term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.

To achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with extremely high aspect ratio of &#8776;100 and large Ru loading amount reaching up to &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% are synthesized via an efficient and facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The R&#8208;NiRu demonstrate a superb HER performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a great challenge. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with high&#8208;loading amount have attracted great interest due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Herein, by using nickel foam as the substrate, the authors design and precisely synthesize atomic ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with a high atomic Ru loading amount reaching &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The presence of concentrated Cl&#8722; in the synthetic system is beneficial for constructing ultrathin nanoribbons, which, with abundant edge &#63743;OH groups, make it easy to trap atomic Ru. Taking advantage of the synergy between atomic Ru and the nanoribbon morphology of nickel hydroxide, R&#8208;NiRu exhibit a low overpotential of 16&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 40&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in aqueous 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH solution, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope of 43&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that atomically dispersed Ru can significantly reduce the HER energy barrier. Moreover, R&#8208;NiRu maintains exceptional stability after 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This efficient and facile synthetic strategy provides a new avenue for designing efficient catalysts.

         <title>Molecular Dopant&#8208;Dependent Charge Transport in Surface&#8208;Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Field Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants with different electron affinities, charge transfer processes and the scattering effects induced by dopant molecules are directly related for understanding charge transport in a molecular&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide channel. This systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) reveals intrinsic molecular properties that can achieve efficient and controllable molecular doping in TMDCs.








Abstract
The controllability of carrier density and major carrier type of transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) is critical for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. To utilize doping in TMDC devices, it is important to understand the role of dopants in charge transport properties of TMDCs. Here, the effects of molecular doping on the charge transport properties of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are investigated using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ), tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (magic blue), and molybdenum tris(1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolene) (Mo(tfd&#8208;COCF3)3). The temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements show that the dopant counterions on WSe2 surface can induce Coulomb scattering in WSe2 channel and the degree of scattering is significantly dependent on the dopant. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of charge transfer between WSe2 and dopants is related to not only doping density, but also the contribution of each dopant ion toward Coulomb scattering. The first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations show that the amount of charge transfer is mainly determined by intrinsic properties of the dopant molecules such as relative frontier orbital positions and their spin configurations. The authors&#8217; systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped TMDCs will be directly relevant for pursuing molecular routes for efficient and controllable doping in TMDC nanoelectronic devices.

Air&#8208;stable large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys with tunable composition and no evidence of phase segregation are realized by confinement heteroepitaxy. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.








Abstract
Chemically stable quantum&#8208;confined 2D metals are of interest in next&#8208;generation nanoscale quantum devices. Bottom&#8208;up design and synthesis of such metals could enable the creation of materials with tailored, on&#8208;demand, electronic and optical properties for applications that utilize tunable plasmonic coupling, optical nonlinearity, epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero behavior, or wavelength&#8208;specific light trapping. In this work, it is demonstrated that the electronic, superconducting, and optical properties of air&#8208;stable 2D metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys are synthesized byConfinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near&#8208;complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.

         <title>Crack Suppression in Conductive Film by Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregation toward Flexible Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid amyloid&#8208;like protein nanofilm with high mechanical strength and robust interfacial adhesion shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal on a flexible substrate, and significantly diminishes the development of microcracks after repetitive bending or stretching of metal&#8208;coated polymer substrates. This work demonstrates the significant contribution of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation in the fabrication of flexible conductive devices.








Abstract
A fatal weakness in flexible electronics is the mechanical fracture that occurs during repetitive fatigue deformation; thus, controlling the crack development of the conductive layer is of prime importance and has remained a great challenge until now. Herein, this issue is tackled by utilizing an amyloid/polysaccharide molecular composite as an interfacial binder. Sodium alginate (SA) can take part in amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of the lysozyme, leading to the facile synthesis of a 2D protein/saccharide hybrid nanofilm over an ultralarge area (e.g., &gt;400&#160;cm2). The introduction of SA into amyloid&#8208;like aggregates significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the hybrid nanofilm, which, with the help of amyloid&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, effectively diminishes the microcracks in the hybrid nanofilm coating after repetitive bending or stretching. The microcrack&#8208;free hybrid nanofilm then shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal in a Kelvin model on a substrate, which noticeably suppresses the formation of microcracks and consequent conductivity loss during the bending and stretching of the metal&#8208;coated flexible substrates. This work underlines the significance of amyloid/polysaccharide nanocomposites in the design of interfacial binders for reliable flexible electronic devices and represents an important contribution to mimicking amyloid and polysaccharide&#8208;based adhesive cements created by organisms.

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection is reported.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Superior Flexibility in Oxide Ceramic Crystal Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible ceramic nanofibers are fabricated using a ball&#8208;milling&#8208; and curved&#8208;drafting&#8208;assisted electrospinning technique. With this strategy, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals are connected by twin or amorphous grain boundaries, are formed after sintering. The single nanofiber is knottable, while the nanofiber membrane can be folded without fracture, displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter.








Abstract
Oxide crystal ceramics are commonly hard and brittle, when they are bent they typically fracture. Such mechanical response limits the use of these materials in emerging fields like wearable electronics. Here, a polymer&#8208;induced assembly strategy is reported to construct orderly assembled TiO2 crystals into continuous nanofibers that are stretchable, bendable, and even knottable. Ball&#8208;milling the spinning sol and curved&#8208;drafting the electrospun nanofibers significantly improve the molecular structural order and reduce pore defects in the precursor nanofibers. Using this method, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals (brick) are connected by twin grain boundaries or an amorphous region (mortar), are formed after sintering. Mechanical measurements and finite element analysis simulation indicate that the dislocation slip of &#8220;bricks&#8221; and the elastic deformation of &#8220;mortar&#8221; render the nanofibers with a small bending rigidity of &#8776;22 mN and a small elastic modulus of &#8776;20.8 Gpa, thus displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter. More importantly, the reported approach can be easily extended to synthesize a wide range of soft, yet tough ceramic membranes, such as ZrO2 and SiO2.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Circular&#8208;Economy Recycling for Proteins: Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of peptides and high&#8208;tech proteins (silk fibroins, &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films) are depolymerized into their amino acid components. Such amino acids are used as the only source of monomers for polymerizing biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase), outside living organisms. The process is repeated multiple times showing that sequence&#8208;defined polymers can be recycled by fulfilling the principles of circular economy.








Abstract
The billion tons of synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials (i.e. plastics) produced yearly are a great challenge for humanity. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. Proteins are sequence&#8208;defined natural polymers that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (the monomers) followed by their re&#8208;assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed off of random protein mixtures that are &#8220;recycled&#8221; into new proteins whose identity depends on the cell's specific needs. In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;free, cell&#8208;free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase).

         <title>Approaching Nearly 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Organic Light Emitting Diodes Utilizing a Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with an Extended Linear Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Structure</title>

         <dc:description>
A green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with an extended &#960;&#8208;system of linear donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;donor (D) structure is established to simultaneously obtain a horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 92%, a reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8211;1 and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, together affording a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1%.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring preferential horizontal emitting dipole orientation (EDO) are in urgent demand for enhanced optical outcoupling efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, simultaneously manipulating EDO and optoelectronic properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, an extended linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure with both enlarged donor (D) and acceptor (A) &#960;&#8208;systems is established, not only elaborately manipulating parallel horizontal molecular orientation and EDO along its long axis by multi&#8208;driving&#8208;forces for a high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//), but also delocalizing distribution of frontier energy levels for optimized electronic properties. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter simultaneously affords a high &#920;// of 92%, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1. The corresponding OLED achieves a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% among all green TADF devices without any external light&#8208;extraction techniques, together with a maximum power efficiency of 112.0&#160;lm W&#8208;1 and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off. These findings may inspire even better full&#8208;color TADF emitters that push the device efficiency toward the theoretical limits.

         <title>Novel Ultrabright and Air&#8208;Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh&#8208;brightness photocathode materials for use in next&#8208;generation free&#8208;electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials.








Abstract
The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X&#8208;ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub&#8208;nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data&#8208;driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M2O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability.

     alt="Novel Ultrabright and Air-Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh-brightness photocathode materials for use in next-generation free-electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X-ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub-nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial-and-error-based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data-driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gas Sensors
In article number 2105199, Yeon Sik Jung and co&#8208;workers achieve highly selective, quantitative, and multiplex detection of mixed trace level aromatic compound gases through synergistically integrated multimodal sensing. The design of the 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA) significantly enhances both chemoresistive sensing and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy simultaneously. 3D&#8208;CMA multimodal sensors accurately identify the composition and concentrations of mixed gases with very similar molecular structures.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between singleatom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries, is proposed by Shiyong Zhao, Qianfan Zhang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105947. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

Security Labeling
In article 2102542, Dong Hyuk Park, Wook Park, Sunkook Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate chaotic phosphorescent patterns based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Phosphorescent&#8208;pattern&#8208;based PUFs achieve superior microscale randomness and no&#8208;cloning code with ease of fabrication. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain of more than 1017 is achieved on a 25 &#956;m&#8208;cubic MoS2 sample.

Photocathode Materials
The discovery of high&#8208;brightness photocathode materials can considerably expand the capabilities of X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser facilities. In article number 2104081, Evan R. Antoniuk, Evan J. Reed, and co&#8208;workers perform a comprehensive screening of over 74 000 materials to identify novel photocathode candidates. The newly discovered materials are demonstrated to achieve higher brightness and superior air stability than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

Quantum Phase Transitions
As reported by Pavel Jelinek and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104495, length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state and a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a strong candidate for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Super&#8208;thin h&#8208;BN layers have gained significant attention from the scientific community for many applications, including nanoelectronics, photonics, biomedical, anti&#8208;corrosion, and catalysis, among others. This review provides a systematic elaboration of the structural, electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of h&#8208;BN followed by a comprehensive account of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis strategies for 2D h&#8208;BN, including chemical exfoliation, chemical, and physical vapor deposition, and other methods that have been successfully developed in recent years. It further elaborates a wide variety of processing routes developed for doping, substitution, functionalization, and combination with other materials to form heterostructures. Based on the extraordinary properties and thermal&#8208;mechanical&#8208;chemical stability of 2D&#160;h&#8208;BN, various potential applications of these structures are described.

         <dc:description>
Underwater adhesives are in high demand from medical to ocean technology. Key specific challenges are discussed to achieve underwater adhesion, and then an overview of strategies of the existing research and the performances of underwater adhesives achieved is presented. Finally, the possible solutions for the challenges, along with future research directions are discussed.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives are in high demand in both commercial and industrial sectors. Compared with adhesives used in dry (air) environments, adhesives used for wet or submerged surfaces in aqueous environments have specific challenges in development and performance. In this review, focus is on adhesives demonstrating macroscopic adhesion to wet/underwater substrates. The current strategies are first introduced for different types of underwater adhesives, and then an overview is provided of the development and performance of underwater adhesives based on different mechanisms and strategies. Finally, the possible research directions and prospects of underwater adhesives are discussed.

         <title>Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites by Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy on Cobalt Oxides to Enhance the Electrooxidation of Biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) process is complicated, including the HMF and OH&#8722; jointly adsorbed and coupled with each other. In this work, the role of oxygen vacancies is investigated during HMFOR. It is found that the OH&#8722; tends to fill into Vo and participate in the dehydrogenation of HMF molecules, which can improve the catalytic activity of HMFOR.








Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; can fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90 and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m PBS solution. This work sheds insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

         <title>Preparation of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Heterophase Pd@Ir Nanostructures for High&#8208;performance Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Abstract
With the development of phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN), construction of noble metal heterostructures with unconventional crystal phases, including heterophases, has been proposed as an attractive approach towards the rational design of highly efficient catalysts. However, it still remains challenging to realize the controlled preparation of such unconventional&#8208;phase noble metal heterostructures and explore their crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent applications. Here, we synthesize various Pd@Ir core&#8208;shell nanostructures with unconventional fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase (2H: hexagonal close&#8208;packed; fcc: face&#8208;centered cubic) through a wet&#8208;chemical seeded method. As a result, heterophase Pd66@Ir34 nanoparticles, Pd45@Ir55 multi&#8208;branched nanodendrites and Pd68@Ir22Co10 trimetallic nanoparticles have been obtained via the phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase Ir&#8208;based nanostructures on 2H&#8208;Pd seeds. Importantly, the heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acid condition. An overpotential of only 11.0&#160;mV is required to achieve the current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites, which is lower than those of the conventional fcc&#8208;Pd47@Ir53 counterpart, commercial Ir/C and Pt/C. Our work not only demonstrates an appealing route to synthesize novel heterophase nanomaterials for promising applications in the emerging field of PEN, but also highlights the significant role of crystal phase in determining their catalytic properties.

         <title>MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al for Li&#8208;S battery: shape or size?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with controllable shapes and sizes show a great potential in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, neither the relationship between shapes and specific capacity nor the influence of MOF particle size on cyclic stability have been fully established yet. Herein, MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al with various shapes, forming hexagonal platelet crystals (HPC), hexagonal bipyramidal crystals (HBC), and hexagonal prismatic bipyramidal crystals (HPBC) were successfully prepared via co&#8208;solvent methods. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the HBC shape with highly exposed (101) planes can effectively adsorb lithium polysulfides (LPS) during the charge/discharge process. By changing the relative proportion of the co&#8208;solvents, HBC samples with different particle sizes were prepared. When these MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al crystals were used as sulfur host materials, it was found that those with the smaller size of HBC shape deliver the higher initial capacity. These investigations establish that different crystal planes have different adsorption abilities for LPS, and that the MOF particle size should be considered for a suitable sulfur host. More broadly, this work provides a strategy for designing sulfur hosts in Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. In this manuscript, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MoS2 transistor circuits. The Ti3C2Tx films are prepared on glass substrates by a spray coating process followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, the films after a vacuum annealing exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8764; 11,000 S/cm) and a lower work function (&#8764; 4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling&#8208;off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. We demonstrate high yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm thick dielectric layer. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, NMOS inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8208;N Diodes Created in A Single donor&#8208;acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
P&#8208;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, thermoelectric devices, etc. Creating p&#8208;n junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high performance single organic material p&#8208;n junctions have been seldom reported because the diffusion of the dopant counter ions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, we report a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) copolymer films with only one p&#8208;type dopant. The achieved lateral devices exhibited high current densities of &#8764;3.83 A/cm2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8764;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high frequency identification tags. The p&#8208; to n&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism was proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode was obtained which was due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create p&#8208;n junctions in ways of silicon based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Materials for implantable surface electrode arrays: current status and future directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface electrode arrays are mainly fabricated from rigid or elastic materials, and precisely manipulated ductile metal films which offer limited stretchability. However, the living tissues to which they are applied are non&#8208;linear viscoelastic materials which can undergo significant mechanical deformation in dynamic biological environments. Further, the same arrays and compositions are often repurposed for vastly different tissues rather than optimizing the materials and mechanical properties of the implant for the target application. By first characterizing the desired biological environment, and then designing a technology for a particular organ, surface electrode arrays may be more conformable, and offer better interfaces to tissues while causing less damage. Here, the various materials used in each component of a surface electrode array are first reviewed, and we then describe electrically active implants in three specific biological systems: the nervous system, the muscular system, and skin. We last offer considerations for fabricating next&#8208;generation surface arrays that overcome current limitations.

         <title>A hydrogel ionic circuit&#8208;based high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis device for intraocular macromolecules and nanoparticles delivery</title>

Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical current&#8208;based, non&#8208;invasive drug delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage due to Joule heating and electrochemical (EC) reactions. Here, we describe a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC)&#8208;based iontophoresis device for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery. Our HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering EC reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, our device allows safe application of high current intensities (&#8764;87&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. Our high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery to both anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. Our studies highlight the significant safety enhancement enabled by a HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of our device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

&lt;p&gt;Iontophoresis is an electrical current-based, non-invasive drug delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage due to Joule heating and electrochemical (EC) reactions. Here, we describe a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC)-based iontophoresis device for high-efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery.

         <title>A Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic Semiconductor Photocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation in a &#8220;One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8208;Birds&#8221; Manner</title>

         <dc:description>
A Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed out of oxygen&#8208;deficient semiconductor MoO3 spheres for efficient nitrogen photofixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the spheres &#8220;kill two birds with one stone.&#8221; They serve as active sites for nitrogen molecules and induce localized surface plasmon resonance simultaneously. Apparent quantum efficiencies of over 1% are recorded from 700&#160;nm up to 1064&#160;nm.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8722;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8722;x serve as the &#8220;stone.&#8221; They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystals: What's Right for Me?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystals are the basis for many &#8220;smart&#8221; materials used in, for instance, soft robotics and polymer optics. Recently, their potential and appeal for different additive manufacturing techniques has been demonstrated. Insight into the usage of liquid crystals in 3D printing for fabrication at both micro&#8208; and centimeterscale is provided for those wanting to join this exciting, developing field.








Abstract
Recent years have seen major advances in the developments of both additive manufacturing concepts and responsive materials. When combined as 4D printing, the process can lead to functional materials and devices for use in health, energy generation, sensing, and soft robots. Among responsive materials, liquid crystals, which can deliver programmed, reversible, rapid responses in both air and underwater, are a prime contender for additive manufacturing, given their ease of use and adaptability to many different applications. In this paper, selected works are compared and analyzed to come to a didactical overview of the liquid crystal&#8208;additive manufacturing junction. Reading from front to back gives the reader a comprehensive understanding of the options and challenges in the field, while researchers already experienced in either liquid crystals or additive manufacturing are encouraged to scan through the text to see how they can incorporate additive manufacturing or liquid crystals into their own work. The educational text is closed with proposals for future research in this crossover field.

         <title>Continuous Energy Harvesting from UBIQUITOUS Humidity Gradient Using liquid&#8208;infused Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Humidity&#8208;based power generation that converts internal energy of water molecules into electricity is an emerging approach for harvesting clean energy from nature. Here we propose that intrinsic gradient within humidity field near sweating surfaces, such as river, soil or animal skins, is a promising power resource when integrated with liquid&#8208;infused nanofluidics. Specifically, we expose capillary&#8208;stabilized ionic liquid (IL, Omim+Cl&#8722;) film to above humidity field to create a sustained transmembrane water content difference, which enables asymmetric ion&#8208;diffusion across the nanoconfined fluidics, facilitating long&#8208;term electricity generation with the power density of &#8764;12.11 &#956;W/cm2. We attribute this high record to the nanoconfined IL that integrates van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to block movement of Omim+ clusters while allow for directional diffusion of moisture&#8208;liberated Cl&#8722;. This humidity gradient triggered large ion&#8208;diffusion flux for power generation indicates great potential of sweating surfaces considering that most of the earth is covered by water or soil.

         <title>Oligoethylene glycol sidechains increase charge generation in organic semiconductor nanoparticles for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen evolution photocatalysts. We demonstrate that employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol sidechains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2 evolution efficiency compared to their non&#8208;glycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and non&#8208;geminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2 evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion and Water Transport During Solar Evaporation Enabled by Amorphous Hollow Multishelled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuel, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global drinkable water scarcity. However, the suboptimal structure and composition designs still result in a trade&#8208;off between photothermal conversion, water transport and tolerance to harsh environments. Here, we develop an ultra&#8208;stable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) for solar evaporation. This HoMS results in highly efficient photo&#8208;absorption and photothermal conversion, as well as the actual water evaporation enthalpy is decreased. We achieve super&#8208;fast evaporation speed of 4.02&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. More importantly, a World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, heavy metal&#8208; and bacteria&#8208;contained water, even from the extremely acidic/alkaline, radioactive water sources. Notably, the concentration of pseudovirus SC2&#8208;P could be decreased by 6 orders of magnitude after evaporation.

         <title>A Tissue&#8208;like Soft All&#8208;hydrogel Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To develop wearable and implantable bioelectronics accommodating the dynamic and uneven biological tissues and reducing undesired immune responses, it is critical to adopt batteries with matched mechanical properties with tissues as power sources. However, batteries available cannot reach the softness of tissues due to high Young's moduli of components (e. g., metals, carbon materials, conductive polymers or composite materials). The fabrication of tissue&#8208;like soft batteries thus remains a challenge. Here we report the first ultrasoft batteries totally based on hydrogels. The ultrasoft batteries exhibited Young's moduli of 80&#160;kPa, perfectly matching skin and organs (e. g., heart). The high specific capacities of 82 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel lithium&#8208;ion batteries and 370 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel zinc&#8208;ion batteries at a current density of 0.5 A&#183;g&#8211;1 were achieved. Both high stability and biocompatibility of the all&#8208;hydrogel batteries has been demonstrated upon the applications of wearable and implantable. This work illuminates a pathway for designing power sources for wearable and implantable electronics with matched mechanical properties.

         <title>Nanophotonic Materials for Twisted Light Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), offers not only fundamental new insights into structured light&#8208;matter interactions, but also a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. However, current OAM experiments still rely on bulky, expensive, and slow&#8208;response diffractive or refractive optical elements, hindering today's OAM systems to be largely deployed. In the last decade, nanophotonics has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic devices harnessing the generation and detection of OAM modes. We summarize recent metasurface devices developed for OAM generation in both real and momentum space, presenting design principle and exemplary devices. Moreover, we summarize recent development of whispering gallery mode&#8208;based passive and tunable micro&#8208;cavities, capable of extracting degenerate OAM modes for on&#8208;chip vortex emission and lasing. In addition, we discuss the design principle of different plasmonic devices and photodetectors recently developed for on&#8208;chip OAM detection. We further discuss current challenges faced by the nanophotonic field for twisted light manipulation and future advances to meet these challenges. We believe twisted light manipulation in nanophotonics will continue to make significant impact on future development of ultracompact, ultrahigh&#8208;capacity, and ultrahigh&#8208;speed OAM systems&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>

Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). Such challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, we developed brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared &#8545;b (NIR&#8208;&#8545;b) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoparticles via rational design that involved twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter was utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of our nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcame previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that our ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5 W cm&#8211;2). Collectively, our work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;&#8545; AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; single junction solar cell efficiency has been improved from less than 5% to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics (TOPV) have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus became a turning point in the OPV field. In this article, we review the development of NIR absorbing materials for OPVs. According to the low&#8208;energy absorption window, here we classify NIR photovoltaic materials (p&#8208;type (polymers) and n&#8208;type (fullerene and non&#8208;fullerene)) into four categories: 700&#8211;800&#160;nm, 800&#8211;900&#160;nm, 900&#8211;1000&#160;nm, and greater than 1000&#160;nm. Each sub&#8208;section will cover the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure&#8208;property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window will be constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, we present a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors. Finally, we discuss challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next&#8208;generation organic photovoltaics and beyond.

         <title>Multicolor Photonic Pigments for Rotation&#8208;asymmetric Mechanochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photonic crystals have been extensively explored to replace inorganic pigments and organic dyes as coloring elements in printing, painting, sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their brilliant structural colors, chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, most existing photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based pigments can only display monochromatic colors once made, and generating multicolors has to start with designing different building blocks. Here, we report a novel photonic pigment featuring highly tunable structural colors in the entire visible spectrum, made by the magnetic assembly of monodisperse nanorods into body&#8208;centered tetragonal photonic crystals. Their prominent magnetic and crystal anisotropy makes it efficient to generate multicolors using one photonic pigment by magnetically controlling the crystal orientation. Further, the combination of angle&#8208;dependent diffraction and magnetic orientation control enables the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic films that display distinct patterns and encrypted information in response to rotation. The efficient multicolor generation through precise orientational control makes this novel photonic pigment promising in developing high&#8208;performance structural colored materials and optical devices.

&lt;p&gt;Photonic crystals have been extensively explored to replace inorganic pigments and organic dyes as coloring elements in printing, painting, sensing, and anti-counterfeiting due to their brilliant structural colors, chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, most existing photonic-crystal-based pigments can only display monochromatic colors once made, and generating multicolors has to start with designing different building blocks. Here, we report a novel photonic pigment featuring highly tunable structural colors in the entire visible spectrum, made by the magnetic assembly of monodisperse nanorods into body-centered tetragonal photonic crystals. Their prominent magnetic and crystal anisotropy makes it efficient to generate multicolors using one photonic pigment by magnetically controlling the crystal orientation. Further, the combination of angle-dependent diffraction and magnetic orientation control enables the design of rotation-asymmetric photonic films that display distinct patterns and encrypted information in response to rotation. The efficient multicolor generation through precise orientational control makes this novel photonic pigment promising in developing high-performance structural colored materials and optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Super&#8208;resolution imaging of highly curved membrane structures in giant vesicles encapsulating molecular condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Molecular crowding is an inherent feature of cell interiors. Synthetic cells as provided by giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating macromolecules (polyethylene&#8208;glycol and dextran) represent an excellent mimetic system to study membrane transformations associated with molecular crowding and protein condensation. Similarly to cells, such GUVs exhibit highly curved structures like nanotubes. Upon liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation their membrane deforms into apparent kinks at the contact line of the interface between the two aqueous phases. These structures, nanotubes and kinks, have dimensions below optical resolution. Here, we studied them with super&#8208;resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy facilitated by immobilization in a microfluidic device. We demonstrate the cylindrical nature of the nanotubes based on the superior resolution of STED and automated data analysis. The deduced membrane spontaneous curvature is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we were able to resolve the membrane kink&#8208;like structure as a smoothly curved membrane demonstrating the existence of the intrinsic contact angle, which describes the wettability contrast of the encapsulated phases to the membrane. Resolving these highly curved membrane structures with STED imaging provide important insights in the membrane properties and interactions underlying cellular activities.

         <title>Smart Face Mask based on an Ultrathin Pressure Sensor for Wireless Monitoring of Breath Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we design a wireless smart face mask by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8764;5.5&#160;&#956;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8764;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8764;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, we use it to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Bright and Stable Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation displays and lighting sources but merely used, because vulnerability to electrical and thermal stresses precludes high brightness, efficiency and stability at high current density (J) regimes. Here we demonstrate bright and stable QLEDs on a Si substrate expanding their potential application boundary over the present art. First, we grant tailored interface to quantum dots maximizing quantum yield and mitigating nonradiative Auger decay of multi&#8208;excitons generated at the high J regimes. Second, a heat endurable, top&#8208;emission device architecture is employed and optimized based on optical simulation to enhance the light outcoupling efficiency. Our multi&#8208;lateral approaches realize that the red top&#8208;emitting QLEDs exhibit a maximum luminance of 3,300,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a current efficiency of 75.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and an operational lifetime of 125,000,000 h at an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which are the highest of the values reported so far.

         <title>Antiferromagnetism in Ni&#8208;Based Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the lack of any magnetic order down to 1.7 K in the parent bulk compound NdNiO2; the recently discovered 9&#8211;15 K superconductivity in the infinite&#8208;layer Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films has provided an exciting playground for unearthing new superconductivity mechanisms. In this letter; we report the successful synthesis of a series of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films ranging from 8 to 40&#160;nm. We observe the large exchange bias effect between the superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 films and a thin ferromagnetic layer; which suggests the existence of the antiferromagnetic order. Furthermore; the existence of the antiferromagnetic order is evidenced by X&#8208;ray magnetic linear dichroism measurements. These experimental results are fundamentally critical for the current field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that upregulates M2 macrophage polarization and activates downstream immune signaling to restore tissue homeostasis. These findings provide a more practical, simple, and efficient material strategy for regulating macrophages to treat disease.








Abstract
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, it is reported that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro shows that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibit inflammation and promote tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrate that M&#8208;chirality displays higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induces higher cellular contractile stress and activates mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>New Dimension in Magnetism and Superconductivity: 3D and Curvilinear Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly developing field of curvilinear magnetism and superconductivity is reviewed. The covered topics range from novel physical concepts for material science through first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device demonstrations to established technologies of flexible magnetoelectronics. The review is relevant for a broad community of physicists, material scientists, and engineers, targeting fundamental research and technology transfer activities.








Abstract
Traditionally, the primary field, where curvature has been at the heart of research, is the theory of general relativity. In recent studies, however, the impact of curvilinear geometry enters various disciplines, ranging from solid&#8208;state physics over soft&#8208;matter physics, chemistry, and biology to mathematics, giving rise to a plethora of emerging domains such as curvilinear nematics, curvilinear studies of cell biology, curvilinear semiconductors, superfluidity, optics, 2D van der Waals materials, plasmonics, magnetism, and superconductivity. Here, the state of the art is summarized and prospects for future research in curvilinear solid&#8208;state systems exhibiting such fundamental cooperative phenomena as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity are outlined. Highlighting the recent developments and current challenges in theory, fabrication, and characterization of curvilinear micro&#8208; and nanostructures, special attention is paid to perspective research directions entailing new physics and to their strong application potential. Overall, the perspective is aimed at crossing the boundaries between the magnetism and superconductivity communities and drawing attention to the conceptual aspects of how extension of structures into the third dimension and curvilinear geometry can modify existing and aid launching novel functionalities. In addition, the perspective should stimulate the development and dissemination of research and development oriented techniques to facilitate rapid transitions from laboratory demonstrations to industry&#8208;ready prototypes and eventual products.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, we introduce a simple method to produce tailored single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below ten micrometers and ultra&#8208;thin shells with thicknesses below one micrometer. We provide a detailed picture of the formation mechanism and demonstrate that the process can be extended to produce multi&#8208;shell and multi&#8208;core emulsions. Finally, we demonstrate its application to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. Our method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort and expertise and may widen its application to non&#8208;specialized scientific communities.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Solid Electrolyte with Adjustable Interphases Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Increasing the energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact. However, neither single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize it due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL&#8208;CPEs) are proposed by using the plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based electrolyte composites. In&#8208;situ polymerization of propylene carbonate can function as the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrite. The QDL&#8208;CPEs has high ionic conductivity, enhanced electrochemical reaction window, adjustable electrode/electrolyte interphases, and no additional electrolyte&#8208;electrolyte interfacial resistance. Thus, this ingenious design of QDL&#8208;CPEs improve the cycling performances of the NCM811//QDL&#8208;CPEs//hard carbon full cell at room temperature, paving a new way for designing solid&#8208;state battery systems accessible for practical applications.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Surface Structural Effects on High&#8208;temperature Operational Resiliency of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The worldwide energy demand in electric vehicles and the increasing global temperature have called for development of high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with improved high temperature operational resiliency. However, current attention has been mostly focused on cycling aging at elevated temperature, leaving considerable gaps of knowledge in the failure mechanism and practical control of abusive calendar aging and thermal runaway that are highly related to the eventual operational lifetime and safety performance of LIBs. Herein, using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, we report a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects involved in regulating the high temperature operational tolerance of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. Our results collectively show that an ultraconformal poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) coating can effectively prevent LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode from undesired phase transformation and transition metal dissolution on the surface, atomic displacement and dislocations within primary particles, intergranular cracking along the grain boundaries within secondary particles, and intensive bulk oxygen release during high state&#8208;of&#8208;charge and high temperature aging. The present work highlights the essential role of surface structure controls in overcoming the multiscale degradation pathways of high&#8208;energy battery materials at extreme temperature.

         <title>Metal Ion Oligomerization Inside Electrified Carbon Micropores and Its Effect on Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ion adsorption inside electrified carbon micropores is pivotal for the operation of supercapacitors. Depending on the electrolyte, two main mechanisms have been identified so far, the desolvation of ions in solvents and the formation of superionic states in ionic liquids. Here, it is shown that upon confinement inside negatively charged micropores, transition metal cations dissolved in water associate to form oligomer species. They are identified using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate one with each other via hydroxo bridging, forming ionic oligomers under the synergic effect of spatial confinement and Coulombic screening. The oligomers display sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, which leads to supercapacitor capacitance fading. They may be dissolved by applying a positive potential, so an intermittent reverse cycling strategy is proposed to periodically evacuate micropores and revivify the capacitance. These results reveal new insights into ion adsorption and structural evolution with their effects on the electrochemical performance, providing guidelines for designing advanced supercapacitors.

The cations associate one with each other via hydroxo bridging, forming ionic oligomers under the synergic effect of spatial confinement and Coulombic screening. The oligomers display sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, which leads to supercapacitor capacitance fading. They may be dissolved by applying a positive potential, so an intermittent reverse cycling strategy is proposed to periodically evacuate micropores and revivify the capacitance. These results reveal new insights into ion adsorption and structural evolution with their effects on the electrochemical performance, providing guidelines for designing advanced supercapacitors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;activated Reactive Oxygen Species Amplifier for Enzymatic Cascade Cancer Starvation/Chemodynamic /Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
At present, some progresses have been made in the field of cancer theranostics based on nanocatalysts (NCs), but achieving the precisive theranostics in response to specific tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a major challenge. Herein, we engineered a TME responsive upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8208;Cys&#8208;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to in situ amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for cancer starvation/chemodynamic/immunotherapy. One of the biggest merits of this material is that it can preserve inert (off) in normal tissues, and only in TME can it be specifically activated (on) through a series of enzymatic cascade to boost ROS production via a strategy of open source (H2O2 self&#8208;supplying ability) and reduce expenditure (GSH consuming ability). More importantly, the enhanced oxidative stress by UCCG NCs reverses the immunosuppressive TME, and facilitates antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, the starvation/chemodynamic synergistic therapy triggered by UCCG combined with PD&#8208;L1 antibody effectively inhibited the growth of primary tumors and cancer metastasis. In addition, the UCNPs in UCCG presented upconversion luminescence enhancement, which can be exploited to visualize the reinforced ROS generation in real time. Collectively, this work provided an original method for the devisal and exploitation of UCNPs based catalytic immunotherapy.

         <title>Interlayer Exciton in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Semiconductors for 2D Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optoelectronic materials that allow on&#8208;chip integrated light signal emitting, routing, modulation, and detection are crucial for the development of high&#8208;speed and &#8208;throughput optical communication and computing technologies. Interlayer excitons in 2D van der Waals heterostructures, where electrons and holes are bounded by Coulomb interaction but spatially localized in different 2D layers, have recently attracted intense attentions for their enticing properties and huge potentials in device applications. Here, we present a general view of these 2D&#8208;confined hydrogen&#8208;like bosonic particles and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments with respect to the frontier concepts and prototypes. Staggered type&#8208;II band alignment enabled us to expand the interlayer direct bandgap from the intrinsic visible in monolayers up to near or even mid&#8208;infrared spectrum. Owing to large exciton binding energy together with ultra&#8208;long lifetime, room&#8208;temperature exciton devices and observation of quantum behaviours have been demonstrated. With the rapid advances, we can anticipate that future studies of interlayer excitons will not only allow us to construct all&#8208;exciton information processing circuits but also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas on quantum phenomena.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Anisotropic Polymer Materials for Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anisotropy is the characteristic of a material to exhibit variations in its mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical properties, etc. along different directions. Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the 3D printing of anisotropic polymeric materials is presented, including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination techniques. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, potential applications, existing challenges, and future perspectives.

         <title>Nanotechnology Strategies for Plant Genetic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Plant genetic engineering is essential for improving crop yield, quality, and resistance to abiotic/biotic stresses for sustainable agriculture. Agrobacterium&#8208;, biolistic bombardment&#8208;, electroporation&#8208;, and PEG&#8208;mediated genetic transformation systems have been extensively used in plant genetic engineering. However, these systems have limitations, including species dependency, destruction of plant tissues, low transformation efficiency, and high cost. Recently, nanotechnology&#8208;based gene delivery methods have been developed for plant genetic transformation. This nano&#8208;strategy shows excellent transformation efficiency, good biocompatibility, adequate protection of exogenous nucleic acids, and the potential for plant regeneration. However, the nanomaterial&#8208;mediated gene delivery system in plants is still in its infancy, and there are many challenges for its broad applications. In this review, we first briefly discuss the conventional genetic transformation techniques used in plants. After that, we focus on the progress in the development of nanomaterial&#8208;based gene delivery systems. CRISPR&#8208;Cas&#8208;mediated genome editing and its combined applications with plant nanotechnology are also discussed. The conceptual innovations, methods, and practical applications of nanomaterial&#8208;mediated genetic transformation summarized in this review will be beneficial for promoting plant genetic engineering in modern agriculture.

Abstract
There has been considerable interest in developing synthetic micromotors with biofunctional, versatile, and adaptive capabilities for biomedical applications. In this perspective, cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors emerge as an attractive platform. This new class of micromotors demonstrates enhanced propulsion and compelling performance in complex biological environments, making them suitable for various in vivo applications, including drug delivery, detoxification, immune modulation, and phototherapy. This article reviews various proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies based on different micromotor designs and cell membrane coatings in these areas. The review focuses on the motor structure and performance relationship and highlights how cell membrane functionalization overcomes the obstacles faced by traditional synthetic micromotors while imparting them with unique capabilities. Overall, the cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors are expected to advance micromotor research and facilitate its translation towards practical uses.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Solar Cells for Building Integrated Photovoltaics: Transforming Building Fa&#231;ades Into Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid emergence of organic&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskites for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics promises to impact new photovoltaic concepts. Their high power conversion efficiencies, ability to coat perovskite layers on glass via various scalable deposition techniques, excellent optoelectronic properties and synthetic versatility for modulating transparency and colour, allows perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators. In this review, the unique features and properties of PSCs for BIPV application are accessed. Device engineering and optical management strategies of active layers, interlayers and electrodes for semi&#8208;transparent, bifacial and colourful PSCs are also discussed. The performance of PSCs under conditions that are relevant for BIPV such as different operational temperature, light intensity and light incident angle are also reviewed. Recent outdoor stability testing of PSCs in different countries and other demonstration of scalability and deployment of PSCs are also spotlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for realising perovskite based BIPV are discussed.

         <title>Small Dipole Molecule&#8208;containing Electrolytes for High&#8208;voltage Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising competitors for the next&#8208;generation energy storage system with safety and high specific energy, while limited by the absence of low&#8208;cost aqueous electrolytes with wide electrochemical stability window. The decomposition of aqueous electrolytes is mainly facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and the water molecules in solvation sheath. Here we report three types of small dipole molecules (glycerol, erythritol and acrylamide) to develop aqueous electrolytes with high safety and wide electrochemical stability window (over 2.5&#160;V) for aqueous lithium, sodium and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, respectively. The solvation sheath structures are explored by ab initio MD simulations, demonstrating that three types of dipole molecules deplete the water molecules in the solvation sheath of charge carrier and break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules, thus effectively expand the electrochemical stability window. A battery construct by lithium titanate and lithium manganate in glycerol&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits an output voltage of 2.45&#160;V and remains a specific capacity 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This work provides another strategy for exploiting low&#8208;cost high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for aqueous energy storage system.

         <title>Defective Bimetallic Selenides for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to CO is promising for carbon cycle but still remains challenging. Au is regarded as the most selective catalyst for CO2RR, while the high cost significantly hinders its industrial application. Herein, the bimetallic CuInSe2 is found to exhibit an Au&#8208;like catalytic feature: i) the interaction of Cu and In orbitals induces a moderate adsorption strength of CO2RR intermediates and favors the reaction pathway; ii) the hydrogen evolution is energetically unfavorable on CuInSe2, as a surface reconstruction along with high energy change will occur after hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the Se vacancy is found to induce an electron re&#8208;distribution, slightly tune the band structure and optimize the CO2RR route of bimetallic selenide. Consequently, the Se&#8208;defective CuInSe2 (V&#8208;CuInSe2) achieves a highly selective CO production ability that comparable to noble metals in aqueous electrolyte, and the V&#8208;CuInSe2 cathode shows a satisfactory performance in an aqueous Zn&#8208;CO2 cell. This work demonstrates that designing cost&#8208;effective catalysts with noble metal&#8208;like properties is an ideal strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts. Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides have shown promising prospects as active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique the structural, electronic and catalytic properties.

Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks is discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, we describe the key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. We summarize the requirements for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and conclude the review with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

         <title>Biodegradable Polymer with Effective Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Absorption as Photothermal Agent for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photothermal therapy holds great promise for cancer treatment due to its effective tumor ablation and minimal invasiveness. We report herein a new class of biodegradable photothermal agents with effective adsorption in both Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;I and II windows for deep tumor therapy. As demonstrated in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer model, photothermal therapy using 1064&#160;nm irradiation effectively inhibits tumor progression and prolongs survival spans. This work provides a new design of photothermal agents towards a more effective therapy of tumors.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Syntheses of 2&#8208;D Materials: Flash Joule Heating and Other Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the past 17 years, the larger&#8208;scale production of graphene and graphene family materials has proven difficult and costly, thus slowing wider&#8208;scale commercial applications. The quality of the graphene that is prepared on larger scales has often been poor, demonstrating a need for improved quality controls. Here, current industrial graphene synthetic and analytical methods as well as recent academic advancements in larger&#8208;scale or sustainable synthesis of graphene, defined here as weights more than 200 mg or films larger than 200 cm2, are compiled and reviewed. There is a specific emphasis on recent research in the use of flash Joule heating as a rapid, efficient, and scalable method to produce graphene and other 2&#8208;D nanomaterials. Reactor design, synthetic strategies, safety considerations, feedstock selection, Raman spectroscopy, and future outlooks for flash Joule heating syntheses are presented. To conclude, there is a presentation of the remaining challenges and opportunities in the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of graphene and a perspective on the broader use of flash Joule heating for larger&#8208;scale 2&#8208;D materials synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design of Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod Nanoheterostructure for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Pivotal Role of Hole Transfer and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis becomes one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods (DIRs) nanoheterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8208;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfied for their potential applications. Here, we present the first application of a well&#8208;designed ZnSe/CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods (DORs) nanoheterostructure for efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction with H2O as an electron donor. In&#8208;depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultra&#8208;fast (&#8764;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half&#8208;reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides direct image on spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO2 to CO with a rate of &#8764;11.3&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy&#8208;level alignment and unique morphology balance electrons and holes utilization in this nanoheterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

Here, we present the first application of a well-designed ZnSe/CdS dot-on-rods (DORs) nanoheterostructure for efficient and selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as an electron donor. In-depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultra-fast (&#8764;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half-reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides direct image on spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with a rate of &#8764;11.3&#160;&#956;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy-level alignment and unique morphology balance electrons and holes utilization in this nanoheterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar-to-chemical conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Predictive Theory for Domain Walls in Oxide Ferroelectrics Based on Interatomic Interactions and its Implications for Collective Material Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Domain walls separating regions of ferroelectric material with polarization oriented in different directions are crucial for applications of ferroelectrics. Rational design of ferroelectric materials requires the development of a theory describing how compositional and environmental changes affect domain walls. To model domain wall systems, the discrete microscopic Landau&#8208;Ginzburg&#8208;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Application of dmLGD to the classic BaTiO3, KNbO3 and PbTiO3 ferroelectrics shows that A&#8208;B cation repulsion is the key interaction that couples the polarization in neighboring unit cells of the material. dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations and their interactions enables the prediction of different properties for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3 and PbTiO3 only. It is found that the information necessary to estimate the structure and energy of domain&#8208;wall &#8220;defects&#8221; can be extracted from single&#8208;domain 5&#8208;atom first&#8208;principles calculations, and that &#8220;defect&#8208;like&#8221; domain walls offer a simple model system that sheds light on the relative stabilities of the ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric bulk phases. The dmLGD approach provides a general theoretical framework for understanding and designing ferroelectric perovskite oxides.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. We report a novel silk based embolic material (SEM) that was developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics. Natural silk was processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 microns in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs world&#8208;wide, demonstrated a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolized porcine arteries without recanalization and led to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, we show that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;inspired Design of photo&#8208;mechanically Modulated Display Systems for on&#8208;demand Fluorescent Patterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cephalopods can display variable body color/patterns upon environmental stimulation via bioelectricity&#8208;controlled muscle contraction/expansion of skin chromatophores. However, it remains challenging to produce their artificial display analogues that exhibit reversible and rapid switch between multiple expected luminescent patterns, but such systems are very appealing for many practical uses (e.g., data encryption). Inspired by the bioelectro&#8208;mechanical display tactic of Cephalopods, here we present a conceptually new photo&#8208;mechanically modulated fluorescent system that enables on&#8208;demand display of fluorescent patterns via a cascading stimulation&#8208;mechanical movement&#8208;optical output conduction mechanism. Specifically, this biomimetic system comprises a customizable hollow display panel, and a bottom&#8208;tethered photo&#8208;thermally responsive fluorescent actuator. Under NIR light, the photo&#8208;mechanically bending movements of fluorescent actuator will immediately cover the hollow window of display panel, and synchronously manifest as the display of fluorescent patterns. Owing to its desirable time&#8208; and light power&#8208;dependent actuating behaviors, diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be dynamically and reversibly displayed by facilely controlling this single remote NIR signal. This bio&#8208;inspired strategy is universal and promising for fabricating on&#8208;demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and especially single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output features.

         <title>Homojunction Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cell with Over 1&#160;&#956;m&#8208;Thick Photoactive Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and is difficult to be compatible with large&#8208;scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskites QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well&#8208;suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, we first demonstrate efficient CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells with over 1&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, we introduce an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(perfluoronaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) into CsPbI3 QD arrays to prepare different carrier&#8208;type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge&#8208;transfer doping of QDs and carrier&#8208;type transformation from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell has been assembled using different carrier&#8208;type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realize remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells for the first time, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick QD active&#8208;layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

&lt;p&gt;Pure formamidinum (FA)-based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low-dimensional PSCs (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high-efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D-like phase to 2D phases, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA-based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier-diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;-phase formation of pure FA-based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA-based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA-based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low-dimensional PSCs (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA-based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure-FA-based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin 2D NbWO6 Perovskite Semiconductor based Gas Sensors with Ultrahigh Selectivity under Low Working Temperature</title>

Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity to the environment and human and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing, however the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and for the first time, the gas sensing performance based on the ultrathin nanosheets are investigated. The few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed (&lt; 6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (S = 12.5&#160;versus 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#176;C). A small variation of H2S concentration (&lt; 0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensor working in ambient condition based on low&#8208;dimensional, nontoxic and wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite semiconductor. The high carrier mobility, ultrathin structure and soft peculiarity make this type of 2D perovskite semiconductor an ideal material candidate for the fabrication of flexible, transparent and wearable sensing device in the future.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into a new advanced material, a CPMR&#8208;TADF material. OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persisting net in&#8208;plane polarization in highly La&#8208;substituted multiferroic BiFeO3 films is probed operando using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation directly in prototypical magnetoelectric device architectures. A spontaneous domain structure reordering triggered by the first electrical cycles leads to an abrupt enhancement of this net in&#8208;plane polarization.








Abstract
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of their ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, it is shown that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. It is found that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, the experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Friction MSCs Delivery System Improves the Therapy for Severe Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA supramolecular hydrogel is employed as bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) carrier to treat osteoarthritis (OA). Compared with current clinical strategies, DNA supramolecular hydrogel can significantly improve the vitality of BMSCs during delivery, and provide cells with long&#8208;term anti&#8208;friction protection, excellent permeability, 3D support, and 3D microenvironment of cell proliferation and differentiation, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic effect of BMSCs.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder disease affecting about 500 million people worldwide and mesenchymal sem cells (MSCs) therapy has been demonstrated as a potential strategy to treat OA. However, the shear forces during direct injection and the harsher shear condition of OA environments would lead to significant cell damage and inhibit the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, DNA supramolecular hydrogel has been applied as delivering material for MSCs to treat severe OA model, which perform extraordinary protection in MSCs against the shear force both in vitro and in vivo. It is demonstrated that the DNA supramolecular hydrogel can promote formation of quality cartilage, reduce osteophyte, and normalize subchondral bone under the high friction condition of OA, whose molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects are also investigated. It can be anticipated that DNA supramolecular hydrogel would be a promising cell delivery system for multiple potential MSCs therapy.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is proposed to artificially generate basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes in a broad frequency band other than only at eigenfrequency. A five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one 3D OSPSU is constructed, indicating the potential for nano&#8208;operation in microelectronic manufacturing.








Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters. Herein, inspired by metamaterial theory, a programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is developed to artificially generate basic modes in a broad frequency band other than only in narrow eigenfrequency. A (2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2) arrayed, co&#8208;fired, multilayer 3D OSPSU is painstakingly designed and fabricated for generating basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes at nonresonance. To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed. The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for creating extraordinary material properties of piezoelectric ceramics and will inspire brand&#8208;new piezoelectric device designs.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

Here, a composable-gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on-the-fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time- and (bio)ink-saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via local oxygen vacancy migration is observed via temperature dependent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Observations are supported by finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory calculations pointing toward the discovery of a new method of enhancing functional responses in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a new route toward&#8211; achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Tissue Engineering with Mechanically Induced Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissues composed of a collagenous core surrounded by an epithelial sheet serve as shape&#8208;programmable living matter. The shaping process involves solid to fluid transitions in the epithelium induced by mechanical perturbations, and the generation of spatially distributed surface stresses at the interfaces. Optochemical and microsurgical operations generate a new shape that is autonomously stabilized by the re&#8208;epithelization process.








Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodeling cell&#8211;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

A non&#8208;shrinkage nanoporous separator is designed for enhancing the safety of lithium&#8208;ion battery through a novel gel&#8208;stretching strategy. Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.








Abstract
The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) is fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests reveal that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of vertically stacked red (R), green (G), and blue (B) quantum dots (QDs), from chalcometallate RGB QD precursor films, with amorphous oxide semiconductor indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide phototransistor arrays for high&#8208;resolution active&#8208;matrix driving of color&#8208;selective multispectral photodetection is demonstrated. Efficient QD connectivity for reduced trap density and photopatternability essential for pixelation are achieved, which result in ultrahigh photosensitive optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multifunctional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter&#8208;free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays are developed on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs are vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photopatterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays are successfully implemented with the density of 5500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1 &#215; 1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic ranges (&gt;150&#160;dB).

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices.

&lt;p&gt;The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene-based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high-efficiency fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet-harvesting strategy. However, for blue-emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet-exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high-efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet-exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep-blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively.

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ grown ZnSe overlayer functioning as a cultivator can guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions.








Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost, and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution, and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and elongated lifespan (a&#160;capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8722;1. The reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <title>Interfacial Electrostatic&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Enhanced Photomultiplication for Ultrahigh External Quantum Efficiency of Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to boost the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (OPDs) is suggested by stabilizing trapped electron states within the active layer via electrostatic interactions. By introducing an ionic electrolyte interfacial layer and by the resulting built&#8208;in electrostatic interaction, an ultrahigh EQE (&gt;2&#160;000&#160;000%), responsivity (&gt; 10&#160;000 A W&#8722;1), and visible specific detectivity (&gt;1014 Jones) for OPDs is reported.








Abstract
A photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiode (PM&#8208;OPD), where an electric double layer (EDL) is strategically embedded, is demonstrated, with an exceptionally high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2&#160;210&#160;000%, responsivity of 11&#160;200 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 2.11 &#215; 1014 Jones, and gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 1.92 &#215; 107&#160;Hz, as well as high reproducibility. A polymer electrolyte, poly(9,9&#8208;bis(3&#8242;&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;ethylammoinium&#8208;propyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;fluorene)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,7&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene))dibromide is employed as a work&#8208;function&#8208;modifying layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) to construct an EDL&#8208;embedded Schottky junction with p&#8208;type polymer semiconductor, poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;diyl), resulting in not only advantageous tuning of the work function of ITO but also an enhancement of the electron&#8208;trapping efficiency due to electrostatic interaction between exposed cations and trapped electrons within isolated acceptor domains. The effects of the EDL on the energetics of the trapped electron states and thus on the gain generation mechanism are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the drift&#8211;diffusion approximation of charge carriers. The feasibility of the fabricated high&#8208;EQE PM&#8208;OPD especially for weak light detection is demonstrated via a pixelated prototype image sensor. It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.

&lt;p&gt;A photomultiplication-type organic photodiode (PM-OPD), where an electric double layer (EDL) is strategically embedded, is demonstrated, with an exceptionally high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2&#160;210&#160;000%, responsivity of 11&#160;200 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, specific detectivity of 2.11 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, and gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 1.92 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Hz, as well as high reproducibility. A polymer electrolyte, poly(9,9-bis(3&#8242;-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylammoinium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))dibromide is employed as a work-function-modifying layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) to construct an EDL-embedded Schottky junction with p-type polymer semiconductor, poly(3-hexylthiophene-diyl), resulting in not only advantageous tuning of the work function of ITO but also an enhancement of the electron-trapping efficiency due to electrostatic interaction between exposed cations and trapped electrons within isolated acceptor domains. The effects of the EDL on the energetics of the trapped electron states and thus on the gain generation mechanism are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the drift&#8211;diffusion approximation of charge carriers. The feasibility of the fabricated high-EQE PM-OPD especially for weak light detection is demonstrated via a pixelated prototype image sensor. It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh-sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Importance of Surface Adsorbates in Solution&#8208;Processed Thermoelectric Materials: The Case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline SnSe is prepared from surfactant&#8208;free particles prepared in solution. Ionic species adsorbed on the surface compensate for the particles&#8242; charge and remain during processing. The adsorbates affect the nano/microstructure of the final material and its transport properties. In the case of sodium, it remains as a dopant and forms secondary phases that induce energy filtering effects.








Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerges as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na+ ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8211;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>An Axially Continuous Graphene&#8211;Copper Wire for High&#8208;Power Transmission: Thermoelectrical Characterization and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter copper wires offer significantly enhanced thermoelectrical properties including a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit. The application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through these innovative graphene&#8211;metal wires is possibly due to 224% higher surface heat dissipation, 41% higher electrical conductivity, and improved thermal stability (i.e., 41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450 &#176;C).








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;power electrical transmission continues to increase with technical advances in electric vehicles, unmanned drones, portable devices, and deployable military applications. In this study, significantly enhanced electrical properties (i.e., a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit) are demonstrated by synthesizing axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter wires. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the observed enhancements, the electrical properties of pure copper wires and axially continuous graphene&#8211;copper (ACGC) wires with three different diameters are characterized while controlling the experimental conditions, including ambient temperature, gases, and pressure. The study reveals that the main mechanism that allows the application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through the ACGC wires is threefold: the continuous graphene layers considerably improve: 1) surface heat dissipation (224% higher), 2) electrical conductivity (41% higher), and 3) thermal stability (41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450&#160;&#176;C), compared with pure copper wires. In addition, it is observed, through the use of high&#8208;speed camera images, that the ACGC wires exhibit very different failure behavior near the current density limit, compared with the pure copper wires.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematical design and comparison, Cu&#8208;TCPP stands out from a series of ionically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (IC&#8208;MOFs) for volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detection. H2S and CH3SH can be detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1 ppm, respectively. The sensors display outstanding selectivity toward VSCs, and their low&#8208;cost and facile preparation make the devices disposable.








Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here, highly selective chemical sensors are developed with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOFs are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable strategy is attempted using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique to fluorinate&#160;hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The nature of fluorine bonding to the&#160;hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are evaluated using various analytical techniques and theoretical models. Interestingly, the derived F&#8208;hBN displays significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties and displays a semiconducting behavior.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a 2D dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is reported. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed perovskite artificial synapse is demonstrated that emulates a biological synapse. The perovskite synapse employs a field&#8208;effect transistor layout with a ferroelectric gate dielectric, wherein the channel conductance can be updated by ferroelectric polarization in a non&#8208;volatile fashion. The perovskite artificial synapse emulates essential synaptic behavior, offering a route to utilize perovskites in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, a solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor is reported for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarization provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarization. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. The strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Optimized Colossal Near&#8208;Field Thermal Radiation Enabled by Manipulating Coupled Plasmon Polariton Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled plasmon polaritons excited by gap&#8208;bridging multilayer graphene/SU8&#160;heterostructures lead to near&#8208;perfect photon&#8208;tunneling probability and improve the state of the art by one order of magnitude in near&#8208;field thermal radiation (NFTR). Electric tuning of graphene Fermi&#8208;level allows for optimized NFTR enhancement. Colossal energy transfer should inspire potential applications in thermophotovoltaic and so on.








Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8776;50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8776;1129&#8208;fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8776;55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Elimination of Interfacial&#8208;Electrochemical&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Induced Polarization in Perovskite Single Crystals for Ultrasensitive and Stable X&#8208;Ray Detector Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers in the coplanar&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detector to isolate the contact between the electrode and the perovskite, the interfacial electrochemical&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced polarization is effectively suppressed under large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1, which results in the superior device performance with a low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites have exhibited bright prospects in high&#8208;sensitivity X&#8208;ray detection. However, they generally suffer from the severe field&#8208;driven polarization issue that remarkably deteriorates the detection performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the interfacial electrochemical reaction between Au electrodes and halogen in MAPbI3 single crystals (SCs) is the major source of the dark current polarization in the metal&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal (MSM)&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors at the initial stage of biasing. By introducing the p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers to isolate the electrodes from contacting the SC surface, the polarization is fully eliminated under a large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the resultant lateral p&#8211;i&#8211;n heterojunction suppresses the dark current of the devices by nearly 3 orders of magnitude as compared to the MSM counterparts and therefore enables a high sensitivity of 5.2 &#215; 106&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 and a record low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1. The excellent biasing stability and sensitivity of the devices allow to prepare the linear detector arrays for X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless&#8208;Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and tunable mass loading of Si NWs is directly grown on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) by a simple and readily scalable glassware setup. Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loadings of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 200 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8208;free Si NWs is restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CCs), as well as complicated/expensive fabrication routes. Herein, a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup is reported. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8208;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings are characterized before and after cycling by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine the effects of Li&#8208;cycling on the morphology. Notably, this approach allows the large&#8208;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8208;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, making it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Anion&#8208;Aggregated Solvation Sheath for Stabilizing High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated Li+ solvation sheath at inner is developed, which guarantees the reversibility of Li plating/stripping and meets the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathode. This peculiar solvated structure plays an important role in tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphases, so as to realize the long&#8208;term cyclability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with limited Li anodes and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 cathodes.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and limited Li&#8208;metal anodes are crucial to realizing high&#8208;energy storage. However, functional electrolytes that are compatible with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li anodes are required for their developments. In this study, the use of a moderate&#8208;concentration LiPF6 and LiNO3 dual&#8208;salt electrolyte composed of ester and ether co&#8208;solvents (fluoroethylene carbonate/dimethoxyethane, FEC/DME), which forms a unique Li+ solvation with aggregated dual anions, that is, PF6&#8722; and NO3&#8722;, is proposed to stabilize high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Mechanistic studies reveal that such a solvation sheath improves the Li plating/stripping kinetics and induces the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with gradient heterostructure and high Young's modulus on the anode, and a thin and robust cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film. Therefore, this novel electrolyte enables colossal Li deposits with a high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;98.9%) for 450 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;assembled Li&#449;LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 full batteries deliver an excellent lifespan and capacity retention at 4.3 V with a rigid negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio. This electrolyte system with a dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated solvation structure provides insights into the interfacial chemistries through solvation regulation for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO2 conversion toward sought&#8208;after products.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3D Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization via In Situ Optical Microscopy&#8208;Assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high-speed side-view and top-view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-based thin-film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin-film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high-speed side-view and top-view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin-film growth and device performance optimization is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent progress and future opportunities to design dual&#8208;stage crosslinked bioinks, which are gels both prior to and after printing. These active, living materials are composed of both acellular and cellular components. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable greater biofunctionality.








Abstract
The encapsulation of cells within gel&#8208;phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next&#8208;generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue&#8208;like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel&#8208;phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries Based on Organic/Organic Cathodes Integrating Multiredox Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous carbon (C) electrodeposited with stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, NAPD) nanorods and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) nanodots, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer cathode, are first synthesized via a novel two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups, Zn//C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers high energy storage performances.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials with redox&#8208;active sites and flexible structure are promising for developing aqueous zinc ion batteries with high capacity and large output power. However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn2+/H+ and a single functional group, which result in inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, the lead is taken in in situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, 1,5&#8208;NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer. In situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups can act as a strong electron donor as well as Zn2+ host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Introducing multiredox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer&#8208;specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al, with the features of high specific capacity, low&#8208;cost, and abundant reserves, is promising for energy storage. The recent progress of Al anodes for various Al&#8208;based batteries is summarized. The challenges of Al anodes leading to a mismatch between theoretical and practical performance are discussed. Comprehensive strategies for Al anodes to boost the electrochemical performance are presented.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid&#8208;scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum&#8208;based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self&#8208;corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries&#8217; practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al&#8208;based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al&#8208;based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self&#8208;corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.

         <title>Novel Materials for Urban Farming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel materials are key to accelerate the development of technologies to improve the productivity and ensure the sustainability of urban farming. The novel material concepts help in improving seed treatment, alternative substrates, nutrients or pesticide delivery, environmental management, and plant health monitoring. This review highlights the current and potential research directions and challenges in these areas.








Abstract
Scarcity of natural resources, shifting demographics, climate change, and increasing waste are four major challenges in the quest to feed the exploding world population. These challenges serve as the impetus to harness novel technologies to improve agriculture, productivity, and sustainability. Urban farming has several advantages over conventional farming: higher productivity, improved sustainability, and the ability to provide fresh food all year round. Novel materials are key to accelerating the evolution of urban farming &#8211; with their ability to facilitate controlled release of nutrients and pesticides, improved seed health, substrates with better water retention capability, more efficient recycling of agricultural waste, and precise plant health monitoring. Materials science enables environmental sustainability and higher harvest yields in urban farms. Here, Singapore is used as an example of a land&#8208;scarce city where urban farming may be the solution for future food production. Potential research directions and challenges in urban farming are highlighted, and how material optimization and innovation drive the development of urban farming to meet national and global food demands is briefly discussed. This review serves as a guide for researchers and a reference for stakeholders of urban farms, policy makers, and other interested parties.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Mediated Twinning&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Fine Hexagonal Microstructure Generated by Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys. However, its activation in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure obtained by laser&#8208;based metal additive manufacturing.








Abstract
The grain size is a determinant microstructural feature to enable the activation of deformation twinning in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals. Although deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys, its activation is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure by introducing ductile body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) nano&#8208;layer interfaces. The fast solidification and cooling conditions of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are exploited to obtain a fine microstructure that, coupled with an intensified intrinsic heat treatment, permits to generate the bcc nano&#8208;layers. In situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction allows tracking the activation and evolution of mechanical twinning in real&#8208;time. The findings obtained show the potential of ductile nano&#8208;layering for the novel design of hcp damage tolerant materials with improved life spans.

         <title>Advancing 2D Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar cells incorporating 2D perovskites show tradeoffs between efficiency and stability. The challenges these solar cells face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. Several recommendations are proposed on how to further improve perovskite solar cells so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as one of the hottest topics in the photovoltaics community owing to their high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCE), and the promise to be produced at low cost. Among various PSCs, typical 3D perovskite&#8208;based solar cells deliver high PCE but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. In contrast to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites that incorporate larger, less volatile, and generally more hydrophobic organic cations exhibit much improved thermal, chemical, and environmental stability. 2D perovskites can have different roles within a solar cell, either as the primary light absorber (2D PSCs), or as a capping layer atop a 3D perovskite absorbing layer (2D/3D PSCs). Tradeoffs between PCE and stability exist in both types of PSCs&#8212;2D PSCs are more stable but exhibit lower efficiency while 2D/3D PSCs deliver exciting efficiency but show relatively poor stability. To address this PCE/stability tradeoff, the challenges both the 2D and 2D/3D PSCs face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. It is ended with several recommendations on how to further improve PSCs so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.
