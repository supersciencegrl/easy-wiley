         <title>Non&#8208;Interleaved Shared&#8208;Aperture Full&#8208;Stokes Metalens via Prior&#8208;Knowledge&#8208;Driven Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;based light field modulation techniques have enabled highly integrated full&#8208;Stokes imagers. Here, the prior&#8208;knowledge&#8208;driven inverse design method is proposed to enable a non&#8208;interleaved shared&#8208;aperture full&#8208;Stokes metalens, significantly promoting the revolution of full&#8208;Stokes imagers toward high performance, such as diffraction&#8208;limited resolution and high diffractive efficiency, with simple hardware architecture. The designed full&#8208;Stokes imager is applied to contactless surface slope measurements.








Abstract
Characterization of electromagnetic wave polarization states is critical in various applications of materials, biomedical, and imaging. The emergence of metasurfaces opens up the possibility of implementing highly integrated full&#8208;Stokes imagers. Despite rapid development, prevailing schemes on metasurface&#8208;based full&#8208;Stokes imagers require interleaved or cascaded designs, inevitably resulting in performance deterioration, bulky size, and complicating the imaging procedure due to misalignment. To overcome these challenges, a non&#8208;interleaved shared&#8208;aperture full&#8208;Stokes metalens enabled by the prior&#8208;knowledge&#8208;driven inverse design methodology is proposed. The metalens can be directly deployed into imagers, performing high&#8208;accuracy diffraction&#8208;limited full&#8208;Stokes imaging without other ancillary components, breaking intrinsic constraints of efficiency and resolution in interleaved design. To demonstrate this, the metalens is integrated into the W&#8208;band passive imaging system, as an alternative solution, to perform polarimetric imaging, which reduces the reliance on the high cost and high complexity of the ortho&#8208;mode transducer and broadband correlator in traditional polarimetric radiometers. Furthermore, with the assistance of a 3D reconstruction method, the feasibility of multi&#8208;polarization information for contactless surface slope measurements is explored. This work may open new paradigms for the full&#8208;Stokes imager designing and broaden the applications of metasurface polarimetric imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Symmetry Control in Photoexcited Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead sulfide quantum dots undergo reversible symmetry changes upon photoexcitation. This process is driven by photogenerated charge carriers, which transitions ground state lower symmetry quantum dots into an excited state higher symmetry phase for about 100 ps. Light&#8208;induced symmetry manipulation offers new ways to control electronic, quantum, photonic and catalytic properties of quantum dots on ultrafast timescales. 








Abstract
Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems. Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials remains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, reversible symmetry changes are unveiled in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X&#8208;ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic&#8208;scale structural modeling and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is revealed that symmetry&#8208;broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off&#8208;centering for about 100&#160;ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties, and the bandgap transiently red&#8208;shifts in the symmetry&#8208;restored quantum dots. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Giant InP Quantum Dots with Stress&#8208;Released Morphological ZnSe&#8208;ZnSeS&#8208;ZnS Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are promising alternatives to cadmium&#8208;based QDs, yet face stability challenges. This study presents a synthetic method for giant InP with morphological ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS shell with over 90% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). By addressing lattice mismatch strain, these giant QDs achieve improved stability, advancing future applications in eco&#8208;friendly displays and energy&#8208;efficient lighting.








Abstract
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are increasingly considered potent alternatives to traditional cadmium&#8208;based QDs. Notwithstanding, the material stability of InP, especially when juxtaposed with its cadmium&#8208;based counterparts, poses significant challenges in its application. Generally, a thick ZnS shell is applied to InP cores to thwart photo&#8208;oxidation and diminish nonradiative recombination. Yet, the pronounced lattice mismatch between the InP core and the ZnS shell can introduce lattice defects, consequently attenuating the luminescence efficiency. This makes the cultivation of a flawless thick shell a paramount challenge. In the present research, a synthetic methodology is elucidated to fabricate highly efficient InP QDs with dimensions exceeding 20&#160;nm, achieved by alleviating the lattice mismatch strain during the shell growth. By regulating the shell composition and morphology, InP/ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with shield&#8208;like morphology are prepared and demonstrate a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%, exhibiting significantly enhanced photostability and thermal stability. This discovery is expected to greatly advance the preparation of highly efficient InP&#8208;based or other QDs, expanding their potential in various applications such as environmentally friendly displays and energy&#8208;saving lighting.

         <title>Quantitative Identification of Dopant Occupation in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative identification of dopant occupation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is proposed by macroscopic sample characterizations. The doping sites of Al and Mg are thus statistically revealed, showing an important influence on the activity of oxygen anions for Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.








Abstract
Elemental doping is widely used to improve the performance of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, macroscopic/statistical investigation on how doping sites are distributed in the material lattice, despite being a key prerequisite for understanding and manipulating the doping effect, has not been effectively established. Herein, to solve this predicament, a universal strategy is proposed to quantitatively identify the locations of Al and Mg dopants in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs). Solid evidence confirms that Al prefers to occupy the transition metal (TM) layer, while Mg evenly occupies both TM and Li layers. As a result, Mg significantly reduces the thickness of LiO2 slabs at room temperature, which will increase the energy barrier of oxygen activation and enhance the structure stability of LLOs. The suppressed oxygen activity in Mg&#8208;doped LLO can be kinetically unlocked at 55&#160;&#176;C. The different characteristics of Al and Mg enlighten an Al/Mg co&#8208;doping strategy to optimize LLOs, which significantly improves the cycle performance while lifting the capacity. These insights from the quantitative identification of doping sites shed light on the manipulation of doping effects toward better cathodes.

         <title>Quantification of Interfacial Charges in Multilayered Nanocapacitors by Operando Electron Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando off&#8208;axis electron holography is used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces and metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO2&#8208; and Al2O3&#8208;based nanocapacitors. The electrostatic potential maps, recorded with a sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, demonstrate that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device.








Abstract
Interfaces in heterostructures play a major role in the functionality of electronic devices. Phenomena such as charge trapping/detrapping at interfaces under electric field affect the dynamics of metal/oxide/metal capacitors and metal/oxide/semiconductor transistors used for memory and logic applications. Charge traps are also key for the stabilization of a ferroelectric polarization and its ability to switch in ferroelectric devices such as ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). However, electric&#8208;field induced charging phenomena remain unclear even in conventional dielectric heterostructures due to a lack of direct measurement methods. Here, it is shown how operando off&#8208;axis electron holography can be used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces as well as metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO2&#8208; and Al2O3&#8208;based nanocapacitors. By mapping the electrostatic potential at sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, it is demonstrated that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device.

&lt;p&gt;Operando off-axis electron holography is used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces and metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based nanocapacitors. The electrostatic potential maps, recorded with a sub-nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, demonstrate that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfaces in heterostructures play a major role in the functionality of electronic devices. Phenomena such as charge trapping/detrapping at interfaces under electric field affect the dynamics of metal/oxide/metal capacitors and metal/oxide/semiconductor transistors used for memory and logic applications. Charge traps are also key for the stabilization of a ferroelectric polarization and its ability to switch in ferroelectric devices such as ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). However, electric-field induced charging phenomena remain unclear even in conventional dielectric heterostructures due to a lack of direct measurement methods. Here, it is shown how operando off-axis electron holography can be used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces as well as metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based nanocapacitors. By mapping the electrostatic potential at sub-nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, it is demonstrated that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device. The unprecedented sensitivity of the electron holography experiments coupled with numerical simulations highlights for the first time the linear relationship between the trapped charges at each interface and the applied bias, and the effect of the trapped charges on the local electrical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Nickel&#8211;Iron Nitride Electrocatalyst for Industrial&#8208;Scale Seawater Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered Ni3FeN electrocatalyst, featuring a conductive nitride core and Cl&#8722;&#8208;resistant hydroxide shell, demonstrates robust hydrogen production in alkaline seawater. Phosphate&#8208;induced surface reconstruction enhances durability, enabling stable performance for over 2500 h at industrial current densities. This study advances seawater&#8208;resistant catalyst design for sustainable, large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis under alkaline conditions is a crucial technology for sustainable hydrogen production. However, achieving the long&#8208;term stability of the electrocatalyst remains a significant challenge. In this study, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction of a transition metal nitride (TMN) can be used to develop a highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Rapid introduction of phosphate groups (PO43&#8722;) accelerates the in situ surface reconstruction of Ni3FeN, generating a catalyst, with a conductive nitride core and Cl&#8722;&#8208;resistant hydroxide shell that demonstrates outstanding performance, maintaining stability for over 2500 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2 current density in alkaline seawater. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the dynamic evolution of active sites, providing insights into the mechanisms driving long&#8208;term stability. This work not only introduces an efficient approach to TMN&#8208;based catalyst design but also advances the development of durable electrocatalysts for industrial&#8208;scale seawater hydrogen production.

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophil as 19F&#8208;MRI Tracer for Alert Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an inflammatory chemotactic&#8208;engineered neutrophil incorporating perfluoro&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#8208;ether nanoemulsion (Neu@PFC) is reported for targeted 19F&#8208;MRI of acute lung injury. This work presents an appealing approach by combining the biocompatible cell&#8208;based 19F&#8208;MRI tracer with multi&#8208;administration routes for alert diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe complication in clinical settings. Alert diagnosis and severity assessment of ALI is pivotal to ensure curative treatment and increase survival rates. However, the development of a precise ALI diagnostic strategy remains a pending task. Here, leveraging neutrophil's inflammation&#8208;homing and physiological barrier&#8208;navigating capability, a facile strategy is proposed for achieving targeted 19F&#8208;MRI detection of ALI based on the nanoengineered neutrophil internalized with perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion (Neu@PFC). The remodeling process poses a negligible impact on the neutrophil's inherent activation and transmigration functions. The migratory behavior of Neu@PFC toward pneumonia is confirmed in vivo using an LPS&#8208;induced ALI murine model. Direct intratracheal (i.t.) administration contributes to a vast deposition of Neu@PFC within the lung, allowing for real&#8208;time 19F&#8208;MRI visualization and the potential to predict progressive pneumonia. Furthermore, intravenous (i.v.) administration of Neu@PFC enables quantitative assessment of the extent of ALI due to the chemokine&#8208;guided neutrophil migration. This study not only provides a pathway to diagnose ALI, but also sheds light on the neutrophil recruitment and activation cues in different tissues and inflammatory conditions, which is a prerequisite for developing potential therapeutic approaches.

         <title>Bacterial Hybrid Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bacteria&#8208;based hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes are prepared with a new protocol to form spheroplast with &gt; 90% scattering reduction, high FP expression yield fairly keeping the photoluminescence features, and high resilience in polymer matrices (1 year under ambient storage) and similar photostabilities compared to their respective films and devices prepared with the purified FPs.








Abstract
Photon down&#8208;converting filters with fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a new frontier in the quest for rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free and non&#8208;toxic color filters for white light&#8208;emitting diodes. There are, however, concerns related to the FP purification costs and lack of FP recyclability/reuse. Here, the direct use of bacteria in photon down&#8208;converting filters can be of utmost relevance, eliminating purification and allowing in situ production of new FPs. However, their high background autofluorescence/scattering and low stability in polymer coatings have traditionally hampered the application of Engineering Living Materials (ELMs) for photon manipulation. Indeed, there are no examples of ELMs in lighting systems. This work discloses the first protocol to prepare living spheroplasts with &gt; 90% scattering reduction, high FP expression fairly keeping their photoluminescence figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, and excellent resilience in polymer films over 1 year under ambient storage. This unlocked the preparation of the first bacteria hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes integrating ELMs for photon conversion. These devices feature similar stabilities to those using purified FPs, while enabling a cost&#8208;effective strategy and active FP recycling by the simple recultivation of spheroplasts. Overall, this work introduces a successful case toward bacteria&#8208;polymer photon manipulation, in general, and a new living lighting concept, in particular.

         <dc:description>
In 2D optoelectronic devices with the electrodes of 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 and channel of WSe2, the photoresponse is effectively controlled by magnetic fields at room temperature. This room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, achieved by the 2D magneto&#8208;band structure, lays the groundwork for multidimensional responsive optoelectronic devices. It holds promise for the development of robust in&#8208;sensor machine vision systems with gate&#8208;free architectures.








Abstract
Interplay between magnetism and photoelectric properties introduces the effective control of photoresponse in optoelectronic devices via magnetic field, termed as magneto&#8208;photoresponse. It enriches the application scenarios and shows potential to construct in&#8208;sensor vision systems for artificial intelligence with gate&#8208;free architecture. However, achieving a simultaneous existence of room&#8208;temperature magnetism and notable photoelectric properties in semiconductors is a great challenge. Here, the room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse is accomplished in all&#8208;2D optoelectronic devices, employing 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 as the source and drain, with WSe2 forming the channel. The interplay between room&#8208;temperature magnetism and photoelectric properties is realized by introducing the unique magneto&#8208;band structure effect from 2D interface, resulting in magneto&#8208;tunable charge transfer between Fe3GaTe2 and WSe2. The photocurrent in this 2D optoelectronic device exhibits robust response to both the direction and amplitude of external magnetic fields. Utilizing constructed 2D optoelectronic devices with magneto&#8208;photoresponse, traditional gate&#8208;controlled phototransistors are replaced and a prototype in&#8208;sensor vision system with visual adaptation, significantly improving the recognition accuracy to over four times in low&#8208;contrast environments is established. These findings pave a way for achieving high&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, thereby guiding the construction of robust in&#8208;sensor vision systems toward high performance and broad applications.

         <title>Picometer&#8208;Level In Situ Manipulation of Ferroelectric Polarization in Van der Waals layered InSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced in situ biasing and atomic&#8208;scale imaging in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope are employed to investigate and manipulate in real space local picometer&#8208;level structure variations and polarization in a prototype 2D vdW ferroelectrics InSe. Intralayer sliding within each Se&#8211;In&#8211;In&#8211;Se quadruple&#8208;layer is identified to be responsible for switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization and ferroelectricity of InSe.








Abstract
Ferroelectric 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials are attracting increasing attention due to their potential applications in next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and in&#8208;memory computing with polarization&#8208;dependent functionalities. Despite the critical role of polarization in governing ferroelectricity behaviors, its origin and relation with local structures in 2D vdW layered materials have not been fully elucidated so far. Here, intralayer sliding of approximately six degrees within each quadruple&#8208;layer of the prototype 2D vdW ferroelectrics InSe is directly observed and manipulated using sub&#8208;angstrom resolution imaging and in situ biasing in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. The in situ electric manipulation further indicates that the reversal of intralayer sliding can be achieved by altering the electric field direction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reversible picometer&#8208;level intralayer sliding is responsible for switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. The observation and manipulation of intralayer sliding demonstrate the structural origin of ferroelectricity in InSe and establish a dynamic structural variation model for future investigations on more 2D ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Morphing in Oxide Ceramic Kirigami Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;dimensional multiferroic nanomembrane architectures with stretchability and shape reconfigurability are demonstrated. Complex 3&#8208;D microarchitectures such as kirigami frames are fabricated using strain and geometrical engineering. Large mechanical deformation by stretching and dynamic shape&#8208;morphing by electric stimuli are demonstrated. These findings open new avenues in the actuation of microscale 3&#8208;D architectures, showcasing the potential of smart materials, micro robotics, and microelectromechanical systems.








Abstract
Interfacial strain engineering in ferroic nanomembranes can broaden the scope of ferroic nanomembrane assembly as well as facilitate the engineering of multiferroic&#8208;based devices with enhanced functionalities. Geometrical engineering in these material systems enables the realization of 3&#8208;D architectures with unconventional physical properties. Here, 3&#8208;D multiferroic architectures are introduced by incorporating barium titanate (BaTiO3, BTO) and cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) bilayer nanomembranes. Using photolithography and substrate etching techniques, complex 3&#8208;D microarchitectures including helices, arcs, and kirigami&#8208;inspired frames are developed. These 3&#8208;D architectures exhibit remarkable mechanical deformation capabilities, which can be attributed to the superelastic behavior of the membranes and geometric configurations. It is also demonstrated that dynamic shape reconfiguration of these nanomembrane architectures under electron beam exposure showcases their potential as electrically actuated microgrippers and for other micromechanical applications. This research highlights the versatility and promise of multi&#8208;dimensional ferroic nanomembrane architectures in the fields of micro actuation, soft robotics, and adaptive structures, paving the way for incorporating these architectures into stimulus&#8208;responsive materials and devices.

         <title>Rhombohedral R3 Phase of Mn&#8208;Doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Epitaxial Films with Robust Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct rhombohedral R3 ferroelectric phase is successfully synthesized in Mn&#8208;doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 epitaxial thin films, with exceptional remnant polarization, retention, and endurance. This advancement enables the controlled phase transition among R3m, R3, and Pca21 polar phases by simply adjusting the Mn dopant concentration and film thickness. The research broadens the understanding of HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and potentially promotes the advancement of integrated ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric materials are emerging as key components for next&#8208;generation nanoscale devices, owing to their exceptional nanoscale properties and compatibility with established silicon&#8208;based electronics infrastructure. Despite the considerable attention garnered by the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, the polar rhombohedral phase has remained relatively unexplored due to the inherent challenges in its stabilization. In this study, the successful synthesis of a distinct ferroelectric rhombohedral phase is reported, i.e., the R3 phase, in Mn&#8208;doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZM) epitaxial thin films, which stands different from the conventional Pca21 and R3m polar phases. These findings reveal that this R3 phase HZM film exhibits a remnant polarization of up to 47 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature, along with an exceptional retention capability projected to exceed a decade and an endurance surpassing 109 cycles. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by modulating the concentration of Mn dopant and the film's thickness, it is possible to selectively control the phase transition between the R3, R3m, and Pca21 polar phases. This research not only sheds new light on the ferroelectricity of the HfO2 system but also paves the way for innovative strategies to manipulate ferroelectric properties for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Digital Mechanical Metamaterial with Programmable Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where the property design is realized by programming the digital states of DMM, so as to decouple the design of structure and property. These programmable DMMs yield a spectrum of functionalities including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption, and tunable force transmission.








Abstract
Digitization has brought a new era to the world, liberating information from physical media. The material structure&#8211;property relation is high&#8208;dimensional and nonlinear, and the digitization of structure&#8211;property relations may bring unprecedented functional programmability and diversity. Here, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where property design is realized by programming the digital states of the DMM to decouple the design of the structure and property. Transforming the binary stable states of a curved beam to the digital bit, one unit cell of DMM manifests three distinct deformation responses under compression, i.e., compression&#8211;twist coupling (CTC), compression&#8211;shear coupling (CSC), and pure compression (PC). These deformation modes show notable differences in motion and stiffness, which, by digitally programming a series of DMM, can yield a spectrum of functionalities, including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption in cushioning, effective vibration isolation, and tunable force transmission. This study pioneers a versatile material design paradigm that provides much greater freedom for the property design of intelligent mechanical metamaterials.

A stable ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) engineered spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to suppress Li+ migration and passivate the surface defects of perovskite. The additive of FcPF6 facilitates the rapid generation of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+ radicals, promoting efficient charge transfer. The efficiencies reach 22.13% in 6 &#215; 6 cm2 and 20.27% in 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 cm2 modules.








Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI doped spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is widely recognized as a beneficial hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), contributing to high device efficiencies. However, the uncontrolled migration of lithium ions (Li+) during device operation has impeded its broad adoption in scalable and stable photovoltaic modules. Herein, an additive strategy is proposed by employing ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) as a relay medium to enhance the hole extraction capability of the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD via the instant oxidation function. Besides, the novel Fc&#8211;Li interaction effectively restricts the movement of Li+. Simultaneously, the dissociative hexafluorophosphate group is cleverly exploited to regulate the unstable iodide species on the perovskite surface, further inhibiting the formation of migration channels and stabilizing the interfaces. This modification leads to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 22.13% and 20.27% in 36 cm2 (active area of 18 cm2) and 100 cm2 (active area of 56 cm2) perovskite solar modules (PSMs), respectively, with exceptional operational stability obtained for over 1000 h under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 procedure. The novel FcPF6&#8208;based engineering approach is pivotal for advancing the industrialization of PSCs, particularly those relying on high&#8208;performance spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208; based HTLs.

         <title>Air and Thermally Stable Fluoride Bridged Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters Showing Intense Photoluminescence and Potential LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>

Metal fluoride is famous for clean phonon structures. Herein fluoride is used to construct a family of rare earth (RE) clusters RE16(&#956;4&#8208;F)6(&#956;3&#8208;F)12(tBuCOO)18[N(CH2CH2O)3]4 (RE = Eu and Tb) with nano&#8208;size, air and thermal stability is synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot reaction. These clusters display high photoluminescence quantum yield, high color purity, high hydrophobicity,&#160;and high&#160;solubility in common organic solvents, making them ideal phosphor for light emitting diode (LED). 



Abstract
Fluoride based lattice is attractive for reducing phonon&#8208;induced quenching in rare&#8208;earth (RE) based luminescent materials. However, due to the strong affinity between&#160;RE and oxygen, the synthesis of fluoride&#8208;based complexes has to be protected under anhydrous conditions,&#160;and many known fluoride bridged RE clusters are unstable in air. Here, by using the &#8220;mixed&#8208;ligand&#8221; strategy a family of fluoride bridged RE clusters is synthesized, namely RE16(&#956;4&#8208;F)6(&#956;3&#8208;F)12(tBuCOO)18[N(CH2CH2O)3]4 (RE = Eu, EuFC&#8208;16; RE = Tb, TbFC&#8208;16), which are highly stable in air and decomposed thermally only when heating above 435&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, both clusters exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYEuFC&#8208;16 = 87.7%, PLQYTbFC&#8208;16 = 99.0%). Upon warming, EuFC&#8208;16 and TbFC&#8208;16 display&#160;excellent structural, thermal, and chroma stability. Thus, EuFC&#8208;16 and TbFC&#8208;16 have the potential to be used in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices, offering many advantages over commercial phosphors. First, both clusters are soluble in UV&#8208;curable resin at any mixing rate, and the emission colors can be tuned from magenta, turquoise, willow green, and ivory to pure white if mixing blue phosphor BAM:Eu2+. Second, the clusters are hydrophobic, and the LEDs work well after soaking in water, indicating a good quality for outdoor lighting.

         <title>Tuning the Spin Transition and Carrier Type in Rare&#8208;Earth Cobaltates via Compositional Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compositionally complex oxides have shown recent promise as electronic materials, but the role of complexity is often difficult to disentangle from other effects. This paper utilizes compositional complexity as a tunable parameter in an oxide semiconductor to reveal several intriguing functionalities: 1) systematic improvements to crystal quality 2) control over a spin transition, and 3) as a method to dope semiconductors.








Abstract
There is growing interest in material candidates with properties that can be engineered beyond traditional design limits. Compositionally complex oxides (CCO), often called high entropy oxides, are excellent candidates, wherein a lattice site shares more than four cations, forming single&#8208;phase solid solutions with unique properties. However, the nature of compositional complexity in dictating properties remains unclear, with characteristics that are difficult to calculate from first principles. Here, compositional complexity is demonstrated as a tunable parameter in a spin&#8208;transition oxide semiconductor La1&#8722; x(Nd, Sm, Gd, Y)x/4CoO3, by varying the population x of rare earth cations over 0.00&#8804; x&#8804; 0.80. Across the series, increasing complexity is revealed to systematically improve crystallinity, increase the amount of electron versus hole carriers, and tune the spin transition temperature and on&#8208;off ratio. At high a population (x = 0.8), Seebeck measurements indicate a crossover from hole&#8208;majority to electron&#8208;majority conduction without the introduction of conventional electron donors, and tunable complexity is proposed as new method to dope semiconductors. First principles calculations combined with angle resolved photoemission reveal an unconventional doping mechanism of lattice distortions leading to asymmetric hole localization over electrons. Thus, tunable complexity is demonstrated as a facile knob to improve crystallinity, tune electronic transitions, and to dope semiconductors beyond traditional means.

         <title>GraphBNC: Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Prediction of Interactions Between Metal Nanoclusters and Blood Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory&#8208;based tools and artificial neural networks are used to estimate the strength of interactions between gold nanoclusters and blood proteins based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The method is able to predict favorable binding sites utilizing the estimated interactions. The sites are validated with half&#8208;microsecond MD simulations, which demonstrate the stability of the predictions.








Abstract
Hybrid nanostructures between biomolecules and inorganic nanomaterials constitute a largely unexplored field of research, with the potential for novel applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Developing such applications relies critically on understanding the dynamical properties of the nano&#8211;bio interface. This work introduces and validates a strategy to predict atom&#8208;scale interactions between water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and a set of blood proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, and fibrinogen). Graph theory and neural networks are utilized to predict the strengths of interactions in AuNC&#8211;protein complexes on a coarse&#8208;grained level, which are then optimized in Monte Carlo&#8208;based structure search and refined to atomic&#8208;scale structures. The training data is based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AuNC&#8211;protein complexes, and the validating MD simulations show the robustness of the predictions. This strategy can be generalized to any complexes of inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules provided that one generates enough data about the interactions, and the bioactive parts of the nanostructure can be coarse&#8208;grained&#160;rationally.

         <dc:description>
Modulating electrochemical properties via straightforward approaches to achieve expedited fabrication of high&#8208;performance artificial muscles remains challenging. This work significantly enhances the ion transport efficiency while endowing multi&#8208;responsive capability by introducing laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;heterostructures on 3D graphene frameworks. With the exceptional actuation performance, biomedical&#8208;oriented soft robotics under electrical and magnetic stimuli is realized.








Abstract
Efficient ion transport and enriched responsive modals via modulating electrochemical properties of conductivity and capacitance are essential for soft electro&#8208;ionic actuators. However, cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approaches to achieve expedited fabrication of active electrode materials capable of multimodal&#8208;responsiveness remain limited. Herein, this work reports the one&#8208;step ultrafast laser direct patterning method, to readily synthesize electro&#8208; and magneto&#8208;active electrode material, derived from the unique cobalt&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped core&#8211;shell heterostructures within 3D graphene frameworks, for fulfilling the dual&#8208;mode responsive electro&#8208;ionic actuators. The designed nanofiber&#8208;structured heterointerfaces across electrodes and electrolytes further promote highly efficient electron/ion transfer. The developed soft actuator exhibits superior actuation performance of peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak displacement to 13.08&#160;mm under an ultra&#8208;low &#177;0.5&#160;V, with doubled direct current deflection under 200 mT at 1&#160;V, an ultrafast response of 1.38 s and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;90% retention for &#8776;106&#160;000 cycles), even detectable bending to &#8776;280&#160;&#181;m under exceptional &#177;10&#160;mV. The promising demonstration of promoting differentiation and proliferation of stem cells under mechanical strain and electrical stimuli, sheds more light as well on the possibility of facilitating biomedical soft robotics with ultrahigh actuation performance.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ionic Co&#8208;Crystals for Fast Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded ionic co&#8208;crystal (HIC) solid electrolyte is developed with a grain boundary&#8208;based ion transport mechanism showing extraordinarily high ionic conductivity and improved interfacial contact.








Abstract
The development of new ionic conductors meeting the requirements of current solid&#8208;state devices is imminent but still challenging. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded ionic co&#8208;crystals (HICs) are multi&#8208;component crystals based on hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Due to the hydrogen bond network and unique features of ionic crystals, HICs have flexible skeletons. More importantly, anion vacancies on their surface can potentially help dissociate and adsorb excess anions, forming cation transport channels at grain boundaries. Here, it is demonstrated that a HIC optimized by adjusting the ratio of zinc salt and imidazole can construct grain boundary&#8208;based fast Zn2+ transport channels. The as&#8208;obtained HIC solid electrolyte possesses an unprecedentedly high ionic conductivity at room and low temperatures (&#8776;11.2 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C and &#8776;2.78&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) with ultra&#8208;low activation energy (&#8776;0.12&#160;eV), while restraining dendrite growth and exhibiting low overpotential even at a high current density (&lt;200&#160;mV at 5.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) during Zn symmetric cell cycling. This HIC also allows solid&#8208;state Zn||covalent organic framework full cells to work at low temperatures, providing superior stability. More importantly, the HIC can even support zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors to work, achieving extraordinary rate capability and a power density comparable to aqueous solution&#8208;based supercapacitors. This work provides a path for designing facilely prepared, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly ionic conductors with extremely high ionic conductivity and excellent interface compatibility.

         <title>Overcoming Chemical and Mechanical Instabilities in Lithium Metal Anodes with Sustainable and Eco&#8208;Friendly Artificial SEI Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>

Physical and chemical regulation leads to stabilization of lithium anode and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer&#160;with eco&#8208;friendly process from synthesis to disposal.








Abstract
Construction of a robust artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer has proposed an effective strategy to overcome the instability of the lithium (Li). However, existing artificial SEI layers inadequately controlled ion distribution, leading to dendritic growth and penetration. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the manufacturing process and materials of the artificial layer is often overlooked. In this work, a chemically and physically reinforced membrane (C&#8208;Li@P) composed of the biocompatible Li+ coordinated carboxymethyl guar gum (CMGG) and polyacrylamide (PAM) polymers serves as an artificial SEI membrane for dendrite&#8208;free Li. This membrane with hollow channels not only directs ion flux along the interspace of fibers, fostering uniform Li plating but also induces a desirable interface chemistry. Consequently, artificial SEI membrane&#8208;covered Li exhibits stable electrochemical plating/stripping reactions, surpassing the cycle life of &#8776;750% of bare Li. It demonstrates exceptional capacity retention of &#8776;93.9%, &#8776;88.1%, and &#8776;79.18% in full cells paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) and S cathodes, respectively over 200 cycles at 1 C rate. Additionally, the water&#8208;based green manufacturing and biodegradability of the membrane demonstrated the sustainable development and disposal of electrodes. This work provides a comprehensive framework for the design of an artificial layer chemically and physically regulating dendritic growth.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Seed Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system reported here operates at room temperature by employing dual seeds in the anode protection layer. Lithiophilic silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles promote multistep lithiation for high lithium diffusivity during charge and yield Ag&#8211;Zn alloy with high ductility during discharge, both of which contribute to stabilizing the anode|solid electrolyte interface for extended cycle life.









Abstract
Interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), particularly the anode&#8208;less type, has grown alongside the expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) market, because they offer advantages in terms of their energy density and manufacturing cost. However, in most anode&#8208;less ASSBs, the anode is covered by a protective layer to ensure stable lithium (Li) deposition, thus requiring high temperatures to ensure adequate Li ion diffusion kinetics through the protective layer. This study proposes a dual&#8208;seed protective layer consisting of silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles for sulfide&#8208;based anode&#8208;less ASSBs. This dual&#8208;seed&#8208;based protective layer not only facilitates Li diffusion via multiple lithiation pathways over a wide range of potentials, but also enhances the mechanical stability of the anode interface through the in situ formation of a Ag&#8211;Zn alloy with high ductility. The capacity retention during full&#8208;cell evaluation is 80.8% for 100 cycles when cycled at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. The dual&#8208;seed approach provides useful insights into the design of multi&#8208;seed concepts in which, from a mechanochemical perspective, various lithiophilic materials synergistically impact upon the anode&#8208;less interface.

         <title>An Aquatic Autonomic Nervous System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an artificial aquatic ANS with switchable excitatory/inhibitory behaviors in electrolyte and real neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;mediated plasticity. The advanced ANS functions are then demonstrated by controlling the action of the artificial pupil and muscle. This work may provide guidance for innovative artificial nervous systems in fluids with biological language.








Abstract
Reproducing human nervous systems with endogenous mechanisms has attracted increasing attention, driven by its great potential in streamlining the neuro&#8208;electronic interfaces with bilateral signaling. Here, an artificial aquatic autonomic nervous system (ANS) with switchable excitatory/inhibitory characteristics and acetylcholine (ACh)&#8208;mediated plasticity is reported based on the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT). Under the modulation of spatial light and ACh, the system exhibits an immediate switch between excitation and inhibition, and many pulse patterns as well as advanced ANS functions are mimicked. To demonstrate its potential usage, the artificial ANS is then utilized to control artificial pupils and muscles to emulate real biological responses during an emergency. In contrast to previous solid&#8208;state attempts, this ANS is aqueous compatible just like biological nervous systems, which are capable of real neurotransmitter mediation.

         <title>Achieving Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation of Purely Organic Phosphorescent Materials by Chromophore Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of rigid and flexible is proposed host&#8208;guest doping strategies to achieve efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillation. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, the phosphorescence efficiency of the doped crystal reaches up to 99.4%. Compared with single&#8208;component crystals, the doped crystals display markedly enhanced radioluminescence because of the confinement of isolated chromophores and the effective harvesting of triplet excitons, which benefits potential applications in X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Scintillators have attracted significant attention due to their wide&#8208;ranging applications in both industrial and medical fields. However, one of the ongoing challenges is the efficient utilization of triplet excitons to achieve high radioluminescence efficiency. Here, a series of purely organic phosphors is presented for X&#8208;ray scintillation, employing a combined rigid and flexible host&#8208;guest doping strategy. The doped crystals exhibit a remarkable maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 99.4% under UV excitation. Furthermore, upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, the radioluminescence intensities of the doped phosphors are markedly higher compared to their single&#8208;component crystal counterparts. Through systematic investigations, it is demonstrated the crucial role of confining isolated chromophores in enhancing scintillation efficiency. Additionally, a transparent scintillator screen fabricated with the doped phosphor exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray imaging performance, achieving a high spatial resolution of 18.0 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work not only offers valuable insights into suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions of triplet excitons during scintillation but also opens a new avenue for designing highly efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillators.

         <title>Lateral Heterostructures Fabricated via Artificial Pressure Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for portable preparation of lateral heterostructures using artificial pressure gradients has been designed. Taking violet phosphorus as a case, the controllable pressure gradient generated by diamond anvil cells is utilized to fabricate the violet/blue phosphorus and violet/black phosphorus lateral heterostructures.








Abstract
Hydrostatic conditions are generally pursued in high&#8208;pressure research, maintained to prevent the intrinsic pressure gradient on the culets of diamond anvil cells (DACs) from introducing heterogeneity to the structure and physical properties of the regulated materials. Here, a pioneering route to fabricate lateral heterostructures is proposed via artificial pressure gradients intentionally designed in DACs. Under the tailored pressure gradients, different structural phases emerge in distinct parts of the material, resulting in the formation of heterostructures. Harnessing the polymorphic transition nature of violet phosphorus under high pressure, violet/blue and violet/black phosphorus lateral heterostructures with different electrical properties have been successfully prepared by the pressure gradient method. This achievement highlights the potential of artificial pressure gradients as a portable and universal strategy for the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, shedding new light on the preparation and regulation of lateral heterostructures across a wider range of materials.

         <title>Indirect&#8208;To&#8208;Direct Bandgap Crossover and Room&#8208;Temperature Valley Polarization of Multilayer MoS2 Achieved by Electrochemical Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates highly electron&#8208;doped multi&#8208;monolayer 2H&#8208;MoS2&#160;through planar organic ion intercalation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium, EMIM+),&#160;maintaining a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence intensity, and stable valley polarization up to room temperature for future applications of valleytronics and spintronics.








Abstract
Monolayer (1L) group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, offering promising applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics. Despite their direct bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and spin&#8208;valley locking in K or K&#8217; valleys, the ultra&#8208;short valley lifetime limits their room&#8208;temperature applications. In contrast, multilayer TMDs, with more absorptive layers, sacrifice the direct bandgap and valley polarization upon gaining inversion symmetry from the bilayer structure. Here, we demonstrate that multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can maintain 1) a structure with broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, 2) a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and 3) stable valley polarization up to room temperature. Through the intercalation of organic 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (EMIM+) ions, multilayer MoS2 not only exhibits layer decoupling but also benefits from an electron doping effect. This results in a hundredfold increase in PL intensity and stable valley polarization, achieving 55% and 16% degrees of valley polarization at 3 K and room temperature, respectively. The persistent valley polarization at room temperature, due to interlayer decoupling and trion dominance facilitated by a gate&#8208;free method, opens up potential applications in valley&#8208;selective optoelectronics and valley transistors.

         <title>Enable Rechargeable Carbon Fluoride Batteries with Unprecedented High Rate and Long Life by Oxygen Doping and Electrolyte Formulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate (364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1), long life (600 cycles) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2 V by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. This Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates application potentiality in view of its low temperature operation, low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading.








Abstract
Here, a rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate and long life by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. The introductions of Mn2+&#8211;O catalyst and porous structure during the oxidation process of CFx cathode can promote the splitting of Li&#8211;F during charging. By further modulating the electrolyte with triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as anion acceptor and CsF as product modulator, the more readily dissociable CsLiF2 product instead of LiF is preferentially formed, and the TSbCl&#8208;salt protection interface is constructed to confine Li&#8211;F based products and reduce fluoride loss at cathode side. These effects endow Li&#8208;CFx batteries with durable reversible conversion reaction (for at least 600 cycles), ultrahigh rate performance (e.g., 364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2&#160;V. The cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 38342&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 1012&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, this Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates the promising prospects for applications in view of its low temperature operation (e.g., 280 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading (5&#8211;6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), enabling it to move beyond previous role as primary battery and into new role as fast&#8208;charging rechargeable battery with high energy density.

These effects endow Li-CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with durable reversible conversion reaction (for at least 600 cycles), ultrahigh rate performance (e.g., 364 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2&#160;V. The cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 38342&#160;W&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and energy density of 1012&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, this Li-CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; system demonstrates the promising prospects for applications in view of its low temperature operation (e.g., 280 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), low self-discharge ability, large-scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading (5&#8211;6&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), enabling it to move beyond previous role as primary battery and into new role as fast-charging rechargeable battery with high energy density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Intelligent Intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Rapid Screening of Probiotics with Relief&#8208;Enteritis Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC figure shows an advanced intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system integrated with machine learning for efficient, high&#8208;throughput probiotic screening to treat enteritis. This system supports intestinal cell&#8211;probiotic coculture and generates multimodal datasets. Machine learning then analyzes these datasets to detect subtle therapeutic differences among probiotic strains, ranking their effectiveness for cost&#8208;effective, accurate screening.








Abstract
Screening probiotics with specific functions is essential for advancing probiotic research. Current screening methods primarily use animal studies or clinical trials, which are inefficient and costly in terms of time, money, and labor. An intelligent intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip integrating machine learning (ML) is developed to screen relief&#8208;enteritis functional probiotics. A high&#8208;throughput microfluidic chip combined with environment control systems provides a standardized and scalable intestinal microenvironment for multiple probiotic cocultures. An unsupervised ML&#8208;based score analyzer is constructed to accurately, comprehensively, and efficiently evaluate interactions between 12 Bifidobacterium strains and host cells of the colitis model in the intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chips. The most effective contender, Bifidobacterium longum 3&#8211;14, is discovered to relieve intestinal inflammation and enhance epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. A distinct advantage of this strategy is that it can intelligently differentiate small therapeutic variations in probiotic strains and prioritize their efficacies, allowing for economical, efficient, accurate functional probiotics screening.

         <title>Metastable CoCu2O3 Nanocrystals from Combustion&#8208;Aerosols for Molecular Sensing and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combustion&#8208;aerosol processes can stabilize phases that are not thermodynamically favored at ambient conditions. Key is traversing the temperature range of thermodynamic stability with sufficient residence time to form solid crystalline particles before rapid quenching. Here, CoCu2O3 nanocrystals are captured, which feature promising performance for molecular sensing and catalytic applications. Furthermore, versatility to access other metastable compositions and even heterostructures is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metastable nanostructures are kinetically trapped in local energy minima featuring intriguing surface and material properties. To unleash their potential, there is a need for non&#8208;equilibrium processes capable of stabilizing a large range of crystal phases outside thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by closely and flexibly controlling atomic reactant composition, spatial temperature distribution and residence time. Here, the capture of metastable pseudo&#8208;binary metal oxides at room temperature is demonstrated with scalable combustion&#8208;aerosol processes. By a combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and on&#8208;line flame characterization, the occurrence of metastable CoCu2O3 is investigated with controlled crystal size (4&#8211;16&#160;nm) over thermodynamically stable CuO and Co3O4. Immediate practical impact is demonstrated by exceptional sensing and stable catalytic performance for air pollutant detection (e.g., 15 parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion benzene) shown for, at least, 21 days. This approach can be extended to various binary, ternary and high entropy oxides with even more components. Also, secondary phases can be loaded on such metastable nanocrystals to access novel materials promising for actuators, energy storage or solar cells.

         <title>An Ultrastable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Battery Using a Covalent Organic Framework Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (HATP&#8208;PT COF) material is synthesized as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. Due to the stable framework and hydrogen&#8208;bond coordinated mechanism, such HATP&#8208;PT COF can deliver an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries have garnered significant research interest due to their safety and sustainability advantages. However, the development of reliable ammonium&#8208;based full batteries with consistent electrochemical performance, particularly in terms of cycling stability, remains challenging. A primary issue stems from the lack of suitable anode materials, as the relatively large NH4+ ions can cause structural damage and material dissolution during battery operation. To address this challenge, an Aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) material is introduced as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. This material exhibits superior ammonium storage capabilities compared to existing anode materials. It operates effectively within a negative potential range of 0.3 to&#8210;1.0 V versus SCE, achieves high capacity even at elevated current densities (&#8776;74 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1), and demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining a capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, by pairing this COF anode with a Prussian blue cathode, an ammonium rocking&#8208;chair full battery is developedd that maintains 89% capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported ammonium ion full batteries. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for ammonium ion batteries and holds promise for high&#8208;energy storage solutions.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Poly(Ionic Liquid) for Direct and Continuous Production of Pure Formic Acid from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to pure formic acid from flue gas via electrochemical CO2RR process. PIL coating improves CO2 adsorption and lowers the activation barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation. The integrated process shows significantly reduced cost compared to a decoupled process.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the carbon cycle and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, traditional decoupled CO2RR processes involve energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture, conversion, and product separation, which increases operational costs. Here, we report the development of a bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid catalyst that exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to formate. The Bi&#8208;PIL catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency for formate over a wide potential range, even at low 15% v/v CO2 concentrations typical of industrial flue gas. The biphenyl in PIL backbone affords hydrophobicity while maintaining high ionic conductivity, effectively mitigating the flooding issues. The PIL layer plays a crucial role as a CO2 concentrator and co&#8208;catalyst that accelerates the CO2RR kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of Bi&#8208;PIL catalysts in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) electrolyzer for the continuous and direct production of pure formic acid solutions from flue gas. Techno&#8208;economic analysis suggests that this integrated process can produce formic acid at a significantly reduced cost compared to the traditional decoupled approaches. This work presents a promising strategy to overcome the challenges associated with low&#8208;concentration CO2 utilization and streamline the production of valuable liquid fuels and chemicals from CO2.

         <title>Superbly Efficient and Stable Ultrapure Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Tetradentate Pt(II) Complex with Vibration Suppression Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
Spirofluorene at the 5&#8208;6 position of Carbazole suppresses reduced hole traps, and SRH recombination at the dopant molecules, resulting in enhanced F&#246;rster energy transfer and a superb device lifetime of 589&#160;h of LT70. reduced vibration&#8208;coupled structural relaxation, leading to high color purity with 16&#160;nm of full width at half maximum and PLQY of 94.1%.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) are on the brink of commercialization for decades. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational lifetime of PHOLEDs are not yet reached industrial standards. Here, a novel tetradentate Pt(II) emitter with a spirofluorene onto the carbazole unit that minimizes the vibration modes, corresponding to the structural relaxation during the de&#8208;excitation, called the vibration suppression effect is reported. This modification reduces the intensity of the second peak in the spectrum and Shockley&#8211;Read&#8211;Hall recombination by blocking direct hole injection into the emitter while enhancing F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, resulting in 451&#160;h of LT50 (the time until a 50% decrease in initial luminance at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and 25.1% of the maximum EQE (EQEmax). Thanks to the vibration suppression effect, an extremely narrow full width at half a maximum of 22&#160;nm is obtained. In phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLED, ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with Commission internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.136, 0.096) is obtained with 28.1% of EQEmax. Furthermore, 50.3% of the EQEmax and 589&#160;h of LT70 are simultaneously recorded with the two&#8208;stack tandem PHOLED, which is the highest EQEmax among 2&#8208;tandem and bottom&#8208;emission PHOLEDs with CIEy&#160;&lt;&#160;0.15.

         <title>Topological Synthesis of 2D High&#8208;Entropy Multimetallic (Oxy)hydroxide for Enhanced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative topological strategy is developed for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high&#8208;entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca&#8208;rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor. The presence of Zn in the multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide initiates a lattice oxidation mechanism for efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction catalysis.








Abstract
Owing to sluggish reaction kinetics and high potential, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. Herein, an innovative topological strategy is presented for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high&#8208;entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca&#8208;rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor, which possesses inherent structural flexibility enabling tailored elemental adjustments and topologically transforms from a point&#8208;shared structure of metal&#8208;oxygen octahedrons into an edge&#8208;shared structure under alkaline conditions. The presence of Zn in the catalysts causes a shift in the center of the O2p band toward the Fermi level, resulting in more Co4+ species, which drive holes into oxygen ligands to promote intramolecular oxygen coupling. The triggered lattice oxidation mechanism is identified by detecting peroxo&#8208;like (O22&#8722;) negative species using tetramethylammonium chemical probe, along with 18O isotope labeling experiments. As a result, the catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 267&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, ranking it among the top&#8208;performing non&#8208;Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Importantly, the catalysts also show high Fe&#8208;leaching resistance during OER compared to conventional NiFe and CoFe hydroxides/(oxy)hydroxides. The assembled zinc&#8208;air battery enables stable operation for over 225 h at a low charging voltage of 1.93&#160;V.

         <title>Fiber Optic&#8208;Mediated Type I Photodynamic Therapy of Brain Glioblastoma Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy that harnesses a less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer and a modified optical fiber is developed for the first time to implement exceptional photodynamic therapy in the hypoxic glioblastoma after circumventing the light blockage from skin, skull, and tissues.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. The current standard&#8208;of&#8208;care is highly invasive with strong toxic side effects, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality. As a safe and effective clinical approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a suitable option for GBM. Nevertheless, its implementation is significantly impeded by the limits of light penetration depth and the firm reliance on oxygen. To overcome these challenges, herein, a promising strategy that harnesses a modified optical fiber and less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) is developed for the first time to realize in vivo GBM treatments. The proposed AIE PS, namely TTTMN, characterized by a highly twisted molecular architecture and a bulky spacer, exhibits enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission and strong production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals at the aggregated state, thus affording efficient fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided PDT once formulated into nanoparticles. The inhibition of orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenografts provides compelling evidence of the treatment efficacy of Type I PDT irradiated through a tumor&#8208;inserted optical fiber. These findings highlight the substantially improved therapeutic outcomes achieved through fiber optic&#8208;mediated Type I PDT, positioning it as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM.

         <title>Electrolyte Solvation Engineering Stabilizing Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Battery With 4.0&#160;V&#8208;Class Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A WSAS electrolyte is designed by creating robust solvation clusters during the dynamic solvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which relies on the balanced interplay between ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;solvent interactions. This design facilitates the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich CEI and SEI, enabling commercial anode&#8208;free pouch cells to retain 80% of their capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the &#8220;ceiling&#8221; for current sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high&#8208;voltage cathode and anode&#8208;free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion&#8208;stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+&#8208;solvent and Na+&#8208;anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0&#160;V&#8208;class layered oxide cathode from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi&#8208;layer anode&#8208;free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work takes a pivotal step for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Na batteries.

         <title>Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Interface Induced Internal Electric Fields for Electrochromic Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with abundant amorphous/crystalline heterointerfaces (A/C&#8208;TiO2) are constructed. The alignment of Fermi levels of amorphous and crystalline TiO2 domains can introduce an internal electric field and therefore reduce the diffusion energy barrier of Li+. Consequently, it shortens the response time and improves the coloration efficiency.








Abstract
Balancing optical modulation and response time is crucial for achieving high coloration efficiency in electrochromic materials. Here, internal electric fields are introduced to titanium dioxide nanosheets by constructing abundant amorphous&#8208;crystalline interfaces, ensuring large optical modulation while reducing response time and therefore improving coloration efficiency. Aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) reveals the presence of numerous amorphous&#8208;crystalline phase boundaries in titanium dioxide nanosheets. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) exhibits an intense surface potential distribution, demonstrating the presence of internal electric fields. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterointerfaces can generate internal electric fields and reduce diffusion barriers of lithium ions. As a result, the amorphous&#8208;crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets exhibit better coloration efficiency (35.1&#160;cm2&#160;C&#8722;1) than pure amorphous and crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets.

         <title>Electrochemical Switching of Electromagnetism by Hierarchical Disorder Tailored Atomic Scale Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrochemically tailoring interfacial and cationic disordering, atomic electric fields are controllably coupled to form the local polarization domain, which eventually realizes superior electromagnetic tunability and dynamic switching between electromagnetic wave absorption/transparency.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency electronic response governs a broad spectrum of electromagnetic applications from radiation protection, and signal compatibility, to energy recovery. Despite various efforts to manage electric conductivity, dynamic control over dielectric polarization for real&#8208;time electromagnetic modulation remains a notable challenge. Herein, an electrochemical lithiation&#8208;driven hierarchical disordering strategy is demonstrated for actively modulating electromagnetic properties. The controllable formation and diffusion of coherent interfaces and cation vacancies tailor the coupling of atomic electric field and thus the locally polarized domains, which leads to the reversible electromagnetic transparency/absorption switching with a tunable range of &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;20.4 dB for the reflection loss and a broad operation bandwidth of 4.6 GHz. Compared to traditional methods of heteroatomic doping, hydrogenation, mechanical deformation, and phase transition, the electrochemical strategy shows a larger regulation scope of dielectric permittivity with the maximum increase ratios of 260% and 1950% for real and imaginary parts, respectively. This enables the construction of various device architectures including the adaptive window and pixelated metasurface. The results offer opportunities to achieve intelligent electromagnetic devices and pave an avenue to rejuvenate various electromagnetic functions of semiconductive oxides.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Atom Locations in Rocksalt SnTe Thermoelectric Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through transmission electron microscopy and statistical image processing, Cu&#8208;atom locations in a Cu&#8208;doped SnTe rocksalt alloy are investigated to explain its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity for efficient thermoelectric energy production. This study offers atomic&#8208;scale insights for achieving more precise dopant engineering, leading to the accelerated development of functional thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The development of functional thermoelectric materials requires direct evidence of dopants&#8217; locations to rationally design the electronic and phononic structure of the host matrix. In this study, Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy is employed at the atomic scale to identify Cu atoms&#8217; locations in a Cu&#8208;doped SnTe thermoelectric alloy. It is revealed that Cu atoms in the rocksalt SnTe form solid solutions at both Sn and Te sites, contrary to their electronegativity order and the intentional Cu doping at Sn sites. Cu atoms are also located at the tetrahedral and crowdion sites of the face&#8208;centred cubic structure, with varying degrees of correlations. Such high flexibility of Cu atoms in the rocksalt SnTe offers diverse phonon&#8208;scattering mechanisms conducive to the ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity of singly Cu&#8208;doped SnTe. This study offers atomic&#8208;scale insights for achieving more precise dopant engineering, leading to the accelerated development of functional thermoelectric materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Supercapacitors Based on a Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Conducting Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The n&#8208;type conjugated polymer PBDF offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions. It is possible to combine PBDF with the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K to fabricate asymmetric cells with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Environmentally&#8208;benign materials play a pivotal role in advancing the scalability of energy storage devices. In particular, conjugated polymers constitute a potentially greener alternative to inorganic&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based materials. One challenge to wider implementation is the scarcity of n&#8208;doped conducting polymers to achieve full cells with high&#8208;rate performance. Herein, this work demonstrates the use of a self&#8208;doped n&#8208;doped conjugated polymer, namely poly(benzodifurandione) (PBDF), for fabricating aqueous supercapacitors. PBDF demonstrates a specific capacitance of 202 &#177; 3 F&#160;g&#8722;1, retaining 81% of the initial performance over 5000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;m NaCl(aq). PBDF demonstrates rate performances of up to 100 and 50 A&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1 and 2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Electrochemical impedance analysis reveals a surface&#8208;mediated charge storage mechanism. Improvements can be achieved by adding reduced graphene oxide (rGO), thereby obtaining a specific capacitance of 288 &#177; 8 F&#160;g&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate operation (270 A&#160;g&#8722;1). The performance of PBDF is examined in symmetric and asymmetric membrane&#8208;less cells, demonstrating high&#8208;rate performance, while retaining 83% of the initial capacitance after 100&#160;000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1. PBDF thus offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions.

         <title>Engineered Shape&#8208;Morphing Transitions in Hydrogels Through Suspension Bath Printing of Temperature&#8208;Responsive Granular Hydrogel Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple multi&#8208;material 4D printing technique that combines a dynamic temperature&#8208;responsive granular hydrogel with granular suspension bath printing is developed. The printed objects show programmable shape morphing based on printed patterns/bath shapes and exhibit rapid response due to their granular nature. This approach offers a versatile method to fabricate programmable soft actuators with rapid kinetics and precise control over shape morphing.








Abstract
4D printing of hydrogels is an emerging technology used to fabricate shape&#8208;morphing soft materials that are responsive to external stimuli for use in soft robotics and biomedical applications. Soft materials are technically challenging to process with current 4D printing methods, which limits the design and actuation potential of printed structures. Here, a simple multi&#8208;material 4D printing technique is developed that combines dynamic temperature&#8208;responsive granular hydrogel inks based on hyaluronic acid, whose actuation is modulated via poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) crosslinker design, with granular suspension bath printing that provides structural support during and after the printing process. Granular hydrogels are easily extruded upon jamming due to their shear&#8208;thinning properties and their porous structure enables rapid actuation kinetics (i.e., seconds). Granular suspension baths support responsive ink deposition into complex patterns due to shear&#8208;yielding to fabricate multi&#8208;material objects that can be post&#8208;crosslinked to obtain anisotropic shape transformations. Dynamic actuation is explored by varying printing patterns and bath shapes, achieving complex shape transformations such as &#8216;S&#8217;&#8208;shaped and hemisphere structures. Furthermore, stepwise actuation is programmed into multi&#8208;material structures by using microgels with varied transition temperatures. Overall, this approach offers a simple method to fabricate programmable soft actuators with rapid kinetics and precise control over shape morphing.

         <title>Electronic Confinement&#8208;Restrained MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ Anti&#8208;Site Defects in Sodium&#8208;Rich Phosphates Toward Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer and High Energy Efficiency</title>

The electronic confinement&#8208;restrained strategy is innovatively utilized to achieve the regulation of anti&#8208;site defects and to eliminate voltage hysteresis. Accordingly, the sodium&#8208;rich Na3.5MnTi0.5V0.5(PO4)3 cathode breached &#8776;3.2&#8208;electron transfer in common voltage range, enabling the energy efficiency to reach a peak value of 89.5% at 0.5&#160;C and an improvement of 35.5% over the prototype at 30&#160;C.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) super&#8208;ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high operating voltages. However, the voltage hysteresis phenomenon triggered by MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ anti&#8208;site defects (MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD), namely, the occupation of Mn2+ in the Na2 vacancies in NMTP, leads to sluggish diffusion kinetics and low energy efficiency. This study employs an innovative electronic confinement&#8208;restrained strategy to achieve the regulation of MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD. Partial replacement of titanium (Ti) with electron&#8208;rich vanadium (V) favors strong electronic interactions with Mn2+, restraining Mn2+ migration. The results suggest that this strategy can significantly increase the vacancy formation energy and migration energy barrier of manganese (Mn), thus inhibiting MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD formation. As proof of this concept, an Na&#8208;rich Na3.5MnTi0.5V0.5(PO4)3 (NMTVP) material is designed, wherein the electronic interaction enhanced the redox activity and achieved more Na+ storage under high&#8208;voltage. The NMTVP cathode delivered a reversible specific capacity of up to 182.7 mAh g&#8722;1 and output an excellent specific energy of 513.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, corresponding to &#8776;3.2 electron transfer processes, wherein the energy efficiency increased by 35.5% at 30&#160;C. Through the confinement effect of electron interactions, this strategy provides novel perspectives for the exploitation and breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Interface/Dipole Polarized Antibiotics&#8208;Loaded Fe3O4/PB Nanoparticles for Non&#8208;Invasive Therapy of Osteomyelitis Under Medical Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetically targeted composite PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent combined with MTT/MDT/CT is developed for the eradication of acute osteomyelitis infected by S aureus. PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent improved dielectric loss and optimized impedance matching, which improved MW absorption capacity. Due to interfacial polarization and dipole polarization effects, PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent could generate ROS, thus it has MW catalytic performance.








Abstract
Due to their poor light penetration, photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy are ineffective in treating deep tissue infections, such as osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Here, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetic targeting composite system consisting of ferric oxide (Fe3O4)/Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles, gentamicin (Gent), and biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) is reported. The PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent complex is used in combination with MW thermal therapy (MTT), MW dynamic therapy (MDT), and chemotherapy (CT) to treat acute osteomyelitis infected with S. aureus&#8208;infected. The powerful antibacterial effect of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent is determined by the synergistic effects of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the Fe3O4/PB nanoparticles under MW irradiation and the effective release of Gent at the infection site via magnetic targeting. The antibacterial mechanism of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent under MW irradiation is analyzed using bacterial transcriptome RNA sequencing. The MW heat and ROS reduce the activity of the protein transporters on the bacterial membrane, along with the transport of various ions and the acceleration of phosphate metabolism, which can lead to increased permeability of the bacterial membrane, damage the ribosome and DNA, and accompany the internal protein efflux of the bacteria, thus effectively killing the bacteria.

Manganese porphyrins realize cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway activation. The high Mn2+ delivery efficiency and reactive oxygen species generation capability enable this function. The well&#8208;designed delivery system further enhances their accuracy and efficacy to facilitate cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway activation facilitates tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) polarization toward M1 phenotype, and Mn2+ are effective agents for this pathway activation. However, the high in vivo degradation rate and toxicity of Mn2+ hamper clinical application of immunotherapy. Here, this work has newly synthesized and screened manganese porphyrins for Mn2+ transport, referred to as photo&#8208;STING agonists (PSAs), and further encapsulate them into core&#8208;shell nanoparticles named Rm@PP&#8208;GA with dual specificity for tumor tissue and TAMs. Not only do PSAs achieve higher Mn2+ delivery efficiency compared to Mn2+, but they also generate reactive oxygen species under light exposure, promoting mitochondrial DNA release for cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. In Rm@PP&#8208;GA, globin and red blood cell membranes (Rm) are used for erythrocyte efferocytosis&#8208;mimicking delivery. Rm can effectively prolong the in vivo circulation period while globin enables PSAs to be taken up by TAMs via CD163 receptors. After Rm rupture mediated by perfluorohexane in nanoparticles under ultrasonication, drugs are specifically released for TAM repolarization. Further, dendritic cells mature, as well as T lymphocyte infiltrate, both of which favor tumor eradication. Therefore, cancer immunotherapy is optimized by novel PSAs delivered by erythrocyte efferocytosis&#8208;mimicking delivery pattern.

         <title>Super SEI&#8208;Forming Anion for Enhanced Interfacial Stability in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super SEI&#8208;forming anion (SSA) is proposed as an efficient percussor for building self&#8208;restraint interphases between lithium metal electrodes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). The sulfonate and polyfluoroalkyl functionalities in SSA contribute to uniform spatial distributions of designer interfacial species, thus greatly improving the surface coverage property and conformal ability of the interphases.








Abstract
The extremely high chemical reactivity of lithium metal (Li&#176;) electrodes and its enormous volume change during repetitive cycles cause continuous interfacial degradations in prevailing organic electrolytes, thus deteriorating the cycling performances of rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, departing from traditional wisdom on the design of electrolyte components, a super SEI&#8208;forming anion (SSA), as an efficient percussor for building stable interphases on Li&#176; electrode, is proposed. Comprehensive investigations related to the unique anion chemistry of SSA reveal that the sulfonate and polyfluoroalkyl functionalities synergistically contribute to uniform spatial distributions of designer interfacial species, greatly improving the surface coverage property and conformal ability of the resulting interphases. Consequently, the incorporation of SSA leads to significant improvements in the cyclability of Li&#176; electrode (exceeding 575 mAh cm&#8722;2 before failure) and the corresponding rechargeable Li&#176;||LiFePO4 cells [a five&#8208;time increase in lifespan as compared to the benchmark cell with the popular SEI&#8208;forming anion bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI)]. The present work offers a paradigm shift to tame the notorious interfacial issues via upgraded anion chemistry, which can promote the practical development of rechargeable LMBs and other kinds of metal batteries.

         <title>Suppressing Hole Accumulation Through Sub&#8208;Nanometer Dipole Interfaces in Hybrid Perovskite/Organic Solar Cells for Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Photon Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs), the interface between the perovskite and organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) is carefully engineered with dipole interfacial layers (DILs). These DILs form strong interfacial dipoles, effectively reducing energy barriers and suppressing hole accumulation. Additionally, DILs enhance near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting and charge transport, boosting efficiency to 24.0% and achieving stability of 1200&#160;h under extreme moisture conditions.








Abstract
The potential of hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs) is increasingly recognized owing to their advantageous characteristics, including straightforward fabrication, broad&#8208;spectrum photon absorption, and minimal open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss. Nonetheless, a key bottleneck for efficiency improvement is the energy level mismatch at the perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) interface, leading to charge accumulation. In this study, it is demonstrated that introducing a uniform sub&#8208;nanometer dipole layer formed of B3PyMPM onto the perovskite surface effectively reduces the 0.24&#160;eV energy band offset between the perovskite and the donor of BHJ. This strategic modification suppresses the charge recombination loss, resulting in a noticeable 30&#160;mV increase in the VOC and a balanced carrier transport, accompanied by a 5.0% increase in the fill factor. Consequently, HSCs that achieve power conversion efficiency of 24.0% is developed, a new record for Pb&#8208;based HSCs with a remarkable increase in the short&#8208;circuit current of 4.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to enhanced near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Loss of High&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Elastomer via Rigid Short&#8208;Chain Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For wearable electronics, reducing the dielectric loss of elastomers is more important than merely achieving a high dielectric constant. Herein, a simple but effective strategy to reduce the dielectric loss of high&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers is proposed. A ferroelectric elastomer with a high dielectric constant (35 at 1 kHz and 25&#160;&#176;C) and a low dielectric loss (0.09) has been achieved, surpassing all previously reported intrinsic elastomers.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers have broad applications in wearable electronics, which can be achieved by the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers. However, the introduction of soft long chains, with their high mobility under strong electric fields, leads to high dielectric loss. Given the relatively low modulus of relaxor ferroelectric polymers, elastification can be realized by introducing short&#8208;chain crosslinkers. In this work, a molecular engineering design is employed, utilizing a rigid short&#8208;chain crosslinker to create crosslinks with relaxor ferroelectric polymer, resulting in intrinsic elastomers characterized by a high dielectric constant but low dielectric loss. The obtained intrinsic ferroelectric elastomer possesses a high dielectric constant (35 at 1&#160;kHz and 25&#160;&#176;C) and a low dielectric loss (0.09). Furthermore, this elastomer exhibits stable ferroelectric response and relaxor characteristics even under strains up to 80%. The study supplies a simple but effective method to reduce the dielectric loss of high&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant intrinsic elastomers, thereby expanding their application fields in wearable electronics.

This work proposed a strategy to seamlessly integrate the essential functions of multiple sensory, heat regulation, and impact protection into a thin, soft, lightweight, non&#8208;woven textile for smart sportswear via facile coaxial electrospinning technology.








Abstract
Smart textiles with a high level of personal protection, health monitoring, physical comfort, and wearing durability are highly demanded in clothing for harsh application scenarios, such as modern sportswear. However, seamlessly integrating such a smart clothing system has been a long&#8208;sought but challenging goal. Herein, based on coaxial electrospinning techniques, a smart non&#8208;woven textile (Smart&#8208;NT) integrated with high impact resistance is developed, multisensory functions, and radiative cooling effects. This Smart&#8208;NT is comprised of core&#8208;shell nanofibers with an ionic conductive polymer sheath and an impact&#8208;stiffening polymer core. The soft smart textile, with a thickness of only 800&#160;&#181;m, can attenuate over 60% of impact force, sense pressure stimulus with sensitivity up to 201.5 kPa&#8722;1, achieve temperature sensing resolution of 0.1&#160;&#176;C, and reduce skin temperature by &#8776;17&#160;&#176;C under a solar intensity of 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2. In addition, the stretchable Smart&#8208;NT is highly durable and robust, retaining its multifunction features over 10&#160;000 bending and multiple washing cycles. Finally, application scenarios are demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring, body protection, and physical comfort of smart sportswear based on Smart&#8208;NT for outdoor sports. The strategy opens a new avenue for seamless integration of smart clothing systems.

         <title>Freestanding Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;adaptive HOF (Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework)&#8208;based matrix membranes (HMMs) with exceptional flexibility, high water&#8208;vapor permeability, and significant wound healing activity are successfully fabricated using a simple polymer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;air interface technique. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice wound models demonstrate that the self&#8208;adhesive membrane accelerates wound healing by regulating the inflammatory environment of the damaged tissue and promoting faster re&#8208;epithelialization. Notably, RNA&#8208;seq analysis and mechanistic studies reveal that HMMs effectively reduce inflammation and facilitate the transition from the proliferative stage to the remodeling stage of skin development.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are emerging as multifunctional materials with exceptional biocompatibility, abundant active sites, and tunable porosity, which are highly beneficial for advanced wound care. However, a significant challenge involves transforming pristine HOFs powders into lightweight, ultrathin, freestanding membranes compatible with soft biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;Shape-adaptive HOF (Hydrogen-bonded organic framework)-based matrix membranes (HMMs) with exceptional flexibility, high water-vapor permeability, and significant wound healing activity are successfully fabricated using a simple polymer-assisted liquid-air interface technique. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice wound models demonstrate that the self-adhesive membrane accelerates wound healing by regulating the inflammatory environment of the damaged tissue and promoting faster re-epithelialization. Notably, RNA-seq analysis and mechanistic studies reveal that HMMs effectively reduce inflammation and facilitate the transition from the proliferative stage to the remodeling stage of skin development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are emerging as multifunctional materials with exceptional biocompatibility, abundant active sites, and tunable porosity, which are highly beneficial for advanced wound care. However, a significant challenge involves transforming pristine HOFs powders into lightweight, ultrathin, freestanding membranes compatible with soft biological systems. Herein, the study successfully develops shape-adaptive HOF-based matrix membranes (HMMs) using a polymer-assisted liquid-air interface technique. The HMMs conform seamlessly to tissues of different sizes and shapes, effectively stopping bleeding, and provide high water-vapor permeability. Notably, both in vitro and in vivo studies with mice wound models demonstrated that these tissue-conformable HMMs significantly accelerate wound healing by modulating the inflammatory environment of the injured tissue and promoting rapid re-epithelialization. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis and mechanistic studies revealed that HMMs effectively reduce inflammation and facilitate the tissue transition from the proliferative stage to the remodeling stage of skin development.

         <title>Interfacial Stress Transfer and Fracture in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial stress transfer and fracture of a MoS2/graphene vdW heterostructure are studied, through the lateral and vertical strain distributions in the vdW heterostructure revealed in&#8208;situ. This leads to the interfacial shear strength and interfacial fracture energy being estimated, and a failure criterion proposes to predict the failure mechanisms of similar vdW heterostructures with any lateral dimensions.








Abstract
Artificially stacking 2D materials (2DMs) into vdW heterostructures creates materials with properties not present in nature that offer great potential for various applications such as flexible electronics. Properties of such stacked structures are controlled largely by the interfacial interactions and the structural integrity of the 2DMs. In spite of their crucial roles, interfacial stress transfer and the failure mechanisms of the vdW heterostructures, particularly during deformation, have not been well addressed so far. In this work, the interfacial stress transfer and failure mechanisms of a MoS2/graphene vdW heterostructure are studied, through the strain distributions both laterally in individual 2DMs and vertically across different 2DMs revealed in&#8208;situ. The fracture of the MoS2 and the associated states of stress and strain are monitored experimentally. This enables various interfacial properties, such as the interfacial shear strength and interfacial fracture energy, to be estimated. Based only on the measured strength and interfacial properties of a single vdW heterostructure, a failure criterion is proposed to predict the failure mechanisms of similar vdW heterostructures with any lateral dimensions. This work provides an insight to the deformation micromechanics of vdW heterostructures that are of great value for their miniaturization and applications, especially in flexible electronics.

MXene/PVA/PAA&#8208;Hanji (MPP&#8208;H) composites are devised as multifunctional textiles. Energy harvesting function generates electrical power using human sweat and environmental humidity, while asymmetric features of MPP&#8208;H textiles enable superior electromagnetic interference shielding through absorption&#8208;driven mechanisms. Thermo&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical robustness of the MPP&#8208;H is demonstrated by superior flame resistance to protect the human body, rapid Joule heating capability for thermoregulation, and high durability with flexibility and washability.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable electronics, personal mobile equipment, and Internet of Things systems demands smart textiles that integrate multiple functions with enhanced durability. Herein, the study reports robust and multifunctional textiles with energy harvesting, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, flame resistance, and Joule heating capabilities, fabricated by a facile yet effective integration method using the deposition of cross&#8208;linked MXene (Ti3C2Tx), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) onto traditional Korean paper, Hanji via vacuum filtration. Comprehensive analyses confirm robust cross&#8208;linking, structural integrity, and interface stability in the MXene/PVA/PAA&#8208;Hanji (MPP&#8208;H) textiles, which synergistically boost their multifunctional performance. The MPP&#8208;H textiles exhibit remarkable power generation lasting over 60 min with a power density of 102.2 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an energy density of 31.0 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 upon the application of 20 &#181;L of NaCl solution. The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) per unit thickness in the X&#8208;band (8.2&#8211;12.4 GHz) is up to 437.6 dB&#160;mm&#8722;1, with the ratio of absorption to reflection reaching 4.5, outperforming existing EMI shielding materials. Superior thermo&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties (flame resistance, rapid Joule heating, durability, and washability) further demonstrate their versatile usability. The MPP&#8208;H enables diverse functionalities within a single, robust textile through a scalable fabrication method, offering transformative potential for wearable and mobility platforms.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven, Reversible Spatiotemporal Control of Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is utilized for the reversible spatiotemporal activation of dynamic bond exchange in a covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer. The reorganization rate of the network structure is controlled by the exposure to UV or visible light, which enables advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks exhibit a cross&#8208;linked structure like conventional thermosets and elastomers, although their topology can be reorganized through externally triggered bond exchange reactions. This characteristic enables a unique combination of repairability, recyclability and dimensional stability, crucial for a sustainable industrial economy. Herein the application of a photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is reported for the spatially resolved and reversible control over dynamic bond exchange within a thiol&#8208;ene photopolymer. By the exposure to UV or visible light, the associative exchange between thioester links and thiol groups is successfully gained control over, and thereby the macroscopic mechanical material properties, in a locally controlled manner. Consequently, the resulting reorganization of the global network topology enables to utilize this material for previously unrealizable advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps. Finally, the presented concept contributes fundamentally to the evolution of dynamic polymers and provides universal applicability in covalent adaptable networks relying on a base&#8208;catalyzed exchange mechanism.

         <title>Oriented Crystal Polarization Tuning Bulk Charge and Single&#8208;Site Chemical State for Exceptional Hydrogen Photo&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oriented crystal polarization of CdS nanorods enables a strong electric field (20.1&#8208;fold enhancement), which results in a ultrahigh bulk charge separation efficiency of 72.4% and activates Pt monatomic sites via increasing onsite electron density, rendering exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution activities with a rate of 118.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm of 57.7%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 57798.4 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Rapid bulk charge recombination and mediocre surface catalytic sites harshly restrict the photocatalytic activities. Herein, the aforementioned concerns are well addressed by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and atomic&#8208;site engineering of CdS single&#8208;crystal nanorods for superb H2 photo&#8208;production. The oriented growth of CdS nanorods along the polar axis, vectorially superimposing substantial polar units with orderly arrangement, renders a strong polarization electric field (20.1 times enhancement), which boosts bulk charge separation with an efficiency up to 72.4% (80.4&#8208;fold). Remarkably, polarization electric field alters the chemical state of Pt single sites by orderly reducing the binding energy of Pt atom with stepwise polarization enhancement of CdS substrate, which increases the onsite electron density of Pt from 10.232 to 10.261e&#8722; and *H key intermediates, providing preponderant Volmer&#8208;Tafel/Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky reaction pathways with significantly decreased energy barriers for H2 production. Thus, highly polarized CdS nanorods with atomically dispersed Pt sites perform an outstanding H2 space&#8208;time yield of 118.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum efficiency of 57.7% at &#955; = 420&#160;nm, and a record&#8208;high H2 turnover frequency of 57798.4 h&#8722;1, being one of the best catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. This work highlights the function of polarization in manipulating charge separation and catalytic reaction.

The oriented growth of CdS nanorods along the polar axis, vectorially superimposing substantial polar units with orderly arrangement, renders a strong polarization electric field (20.1 times enhancement), which boosts bulk charge separation with an efficiency up to 72.4% (80.4-fold). Remarkably, polarization electric field alters the chemical state of Pt single sites by orderly reducing the binding energy of Pt atom with stepwise polarization enhancement of CdS substrate, which increases the onsite electron density of Pt from 10.232 to 10.261e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and *H key intermediates, providing preponderant Volmer-Tafel/Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathways with significantly decreased energy barriers for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Thus, highly polarized CdS nanorods with atomically dispersed Pt sites perform an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space-time yield of 118.5&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and apparent quantum efficiency of 57.7% at &#955; = 420&#160;nm, and a record-high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; turnover frequency of 57798.4 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, being one of the best catalysts for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. This work highlights the function of polarization in manipulating charge separation and catalytic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Domain Dynamics Response to Polarization Switching in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A clear and direct link between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching in relaxors is established by integrating ex/in situ multiscale characterizations with theoretical analyses grounded in the Landau&#8208;Ginzburg&#8208;Devonshire (LGD) thermodynamic model. The gains can serve as a guiding principle for the precise manipulation of polarization switching, strategic design, and optimization of relaxors.








Abstract
Nanoscale polar regions, or nanodomains (NDs), are crucial for understanding the domain structure and high susceptibility of relaxors. However, unveiling the evolution and function of NDs during polarization switching at the microscopic level is of great challenge. The experimental in situ characterization of NDs under electric&#8208;field perturbations, and computational accurate prediction of the dipole switching within a sufficiently large supercell, are notoriously tricky and tedious. These difficulties hinder a full understanding of the link between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching. Herein, the real&#8208;time evolution of NDs at the nanoscale is observed and visualized during polarization switching in an exemplary relaxor system of Bi5&#8208;xLaxMg0.5Ti3.5O15. Two fundamentally different domain switching pathways and dynamic characteristics are revealed: one steep, bipolar&#8208;like switching between two degenerate polarization states; and another flat, multi&#8208;step switching process with a thermodynamically stable non&#8208;polar mesophase mediating the degenerate polarization states. The two are determined by the distinct Landau energy landscapes that are strongly dependent on the intrinsic domain configurations and interdomain interactions. This work bridges the gap between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching, providing a guiding principle for the strategic design and optimization of relaxors.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Organogels with Self&#8208;Healing, Impact Response, and High Damping Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel intelligent protective organogel composed of a hyperbranched fluid as the bulky solvent that is entrapped by dynamic poly(urethane&#8211;urea) network skeleton due to steric hindrance is synthesized. The organogel exhibited self&#8208;healing properties, high stability, remarkable impact responsiveness, and excellent damping properties. It is expected to significantly contribute to the advancement of omnibearing protective materials in cutting&#8208;edge fields.








Abstract
Organogel materials are vital for impact or shock resistance because of their highly tailored dynamic properties. However, concurrently achieving excellent anti&#8208;impact and damping performances, high stability, and self&#8208;healing properties is challenging. Herein, a novel intelligent protective organogel (IPO) comprising a dynamic boronic ester containing poly(urethane&#8211;urea) as the network skeleton with a matching mesh size is synthesized, the network precisely entraps the hyperbranched fluid used as the bulky solvent via steric hindrance. The IPO exhibits self&#8208;healing ability, excellent impact responsiveness (a 1950&#8208;fold increase in flow stress under various impact speeds), and energy dissipation (the loss factor &gt;0.8 from 10&#8722;4&#160; to 104&#160;Hz). The IPO maintains its dynamic mechanical properties during hot pressing and hydrolysis, exhibiting &#160;high stability. Furthermore, the IPO exhibits omnibearing protection. When used as a protective coating, the IPO dissipates the impact force by 87% and 89% of control upon passive and active impact, respectively. When used as a shock pad, it attenuates 91% of the amplitude&#160;in the high&#8208;frequency vibrations. This study offers a novel perspective on the synthesis of tailored sterically hindered organogel and provides valuable insights into the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent protective materials that exhibit impact and vibration resistance.

         <title>Breaking the Lithiation Barrier via Tailored&#8208;Design Facile Kinetic Pathways in TiO2(B) Realizing 50C Ultrafast Charging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consistent lithiation path and morphology anisotropy of rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) is important to minimize the challenging lithiation on the C&#8217; site, thus leads to enhanced Li+ diffusion efficiency and homogeneous Li+ distribution, including a high specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C and a remarkable capacity retention ratio of 93.67% after 5000 cycles at 10C.








Abstract
As a promising anode material for fast charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bronze&#8208;phase titanium dioxide (TiO2(B)) still faces the challenge of sluggish Li+ diffusion kinetics in the solid phase during lithiation/delithiation processes. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy has been proposed to optimize the microstructure of TiO2(B), which enables facilitated lithiation and therefore significantly improved rate performance. The rice&#8208;granular nanoparticles with precisely controlled aspect ratios (AR) can be obtained via manipulating the ligand concentrations that affect nucleation and oriented attachment processes, as well as adjusting the calcination temperatures to control the Oswald ripening process. As a result, the smaller ab plane in rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) enhances Li+ diffusion efficiency on C&#8217; site and inhibits the inhomogeneity of Li+ between inter and inside particles. Benefiting from breaking the Li+ diffusion kinetics, the rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) maintains a high specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C, with an excellent capacity retention ratio of 93.67% after 5000 cycles at 10C. This work provides an efficient and simple strategy to minimize the challenging lithiation paths in TiO2(B) anode, and offers new opportunities for high rate battery design.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth and Advanced Characterization of Chiral Gold Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of gold nanoparticles has created remarkable opportunities to produce nanoparticles with well&#8208;defined chiral shapes and strong chiroptical activities. This perspective focuses on the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of chiral gold nanorods as a convenient case of chiral morphogenesis. Growth mechanisms, chirality measures, and advanced electron microscopy characterization techniques are discussed, aiming to connect chiral morphologies, growth conditions, and optical behavior.








Abstract
The controlled growth of gold nanostructures with complex shapes and reduced symmetry, exemplified by chiral gold nanorods and nanoparticles, is one of the most dynamic fields of nanochemistry. A timely summary of underlying concepts, including growth mechanisms and redefined chirality measures, would further promote this research area. In this perspective, we aim to establish qualitative connections between the chiral shapes and growth conditions, specifically for the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of chiral gold nanorods as a convenient case of chiral morphogenesis. The crystallographic and morphological features of achiral nanorods used as seeds, the experimental conditions during chiral growth, and the symmetry of the chiral inducers, can all be exploited to obtain nanorods with intricate chiral shapes. Chirality characterization (such as electron tomography techniques) and quantification (including chirality measures) emerge as critical aspects to comprehensively explore and understand such structures, enabling optimization of their geometric and optical features. We conclude by discussing relevant challenges to be addressed toward a better controlled synthesis of chiral plasmonic nanostructures.

         <title>Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 Phase Intermetallic Ir Alloy Electrocatalysts Enables High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>

A series of unconventional Frank&#8208;Kasper intermetallic C15&#8208;Ir2M (M = rare earth metals) nanocrystals is prepared as hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts, which features higher Ir&#8208;M coordination numbers and electron&#8208;rich environment. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce/C||IrO2 system in a practical PEMWE requires only a cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V to achieve the industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 and can keep stable for 1000&#160;h at 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Chemical synthesis of unconventional topologically close&#8208;packed intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of large volume asymmetry between the components. Here, a series of unconventional intermetallic Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 phase Ir2M (M = rare earth metals La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Tm) NCs is successfully prepared via a molten&#8208;salt assisted reduction method as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to the disordered counterpart (A1&#8208;Ir2Ce), C15&#8208;Ir2Ce features higher Ir&#8208;Ce coordination number that leads to an electron&#8208;rich environment for Ir sites. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce catalyst exhibits excellent and pH&#8208;universal HER activity and requires only 9, 16, and 27&#160;mV overpotentials to attain 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, representing one of the best HER electrocatalysts ever reported. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the C15&#8208;Ir2Ce cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V at 80&#160;&#176;C and can operate stably for 1000 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 50 &#181;V h&#8722;1. Theoretical investigations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ir sites intensify the polarization of *H2O intermediate on C15&#8208;Ir2Ce, thus lowering the energy barrier of the water dissociation and facilitating the HER kinetics.

         <title>An Oriented Diffusion Strategy to Configure All&#8208;Region Ultrahigh&#8208;Density Metal Single Atoms for High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and scalable oriented diffusion strategy is developed to synthesize ultrahigh loadings of 18.9&#160;wt.% Sn single&#8208;atom metalsover carbon nanorings, leveraging the nanoengineering design of a g&#8208;C3N4/SnO2/polydopamine nested structure. When used as the anode for sodium ion batteries, remarkably enhanced capacity (462&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and durability (over 5000 cycles) are achieved.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metals (SAMs), despite being promising for high&#8208;utilization catalysis, biomedicine, and energy storage, usually suffer from limited catalytic performance caused by low metal loading. Herein, via an oriented diffusion strategy, all&#8208;region ultrahigh&#8208;loading (18.9&#160;wt.%) Sn&#8208;SAMs over carbon nanorings matrix (Sn&#8208;SAMs@CNR) are initially achieved based on the transformation of a g&#8208;C3N4@SnO2@polydopamine ring&#8208;like nested structure. The formation process of Sn&#8208;SAMs involves a critical conversion from oxygen&#8208;coordination (SnO2) to nitrogen&#8208;coordination (Sn&#8208;N4) and simultaneous anti&#8208;Osterwalder ripening promoted under spatial confinement. Notably, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;derived N&#8208;containing gaseous intermediates dynamically drive the oriented diffusion (inside&#8208;out diffusion) of Sn&#8208;SAMs across the carbon nanorings, realizing an all&#8208;region ultrahigh loading of SAMs throughout the carbon matrix. This strategy is also applied to other metal materials (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sb), and features excellent universality. When applied as the anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, experimental analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that high&#8208;loading Sn&#8208;N4 active sites significantly optimize electron density distribution and improve reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn&#8208;SAMs@CNR exhibits outstanding durability of 364&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 &#160; even after 5000 cycles with an impressively low (0.00068%) capacity decay per cycle. This work opens up a universally new avenue for all&#8208;region ultrahigh loading of SAMs to carbon matrix for high&#8208;performance energy storage.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Disruption&#8208;Induced Multi&#8208;Scale Mediating Strategy for Anticoagulation in Blood&#8208;Contacting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;scale mediation coating strategy is proposed to simultaneously inhibit nanoscale coagulation factors and resist aggregation of microscale thrombi. Surface force measurements reveal that the coating disrupts the thrombi skeleton, and in vivo intubation experiments in rabbits show significantly reduced thromboinflammation, promising for the long&#8208;term anticoagulation of blood&#8208;contacting devices.








Abstract
Minimally invasive blood&#8208;contacting interventional devices are increasingly used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the risk of device&#8208;related thrombosis remains a significant concern, particularly the formation of cycling thrombi, which pose life&#8208;threatening risks. To better understand the interactions between these devices and blood, the initial stages of coagulation contact activation on extrinsic surfaces are&#160;investigated. Direct force measurements reveals that activated contact factors stimulate the intrinsic coagulation pathway and promote surface crosslinking of fibrin. Furthermore, fibrin aggregation is disrupted by surface&#8208;grafted inhibitors, as confirmed by ex vivo coagulation tests. An engineered serum protein with zwitterion grafts to resist the deposition of biological species such as fibrin, platelets, and red blood cells is also developed. Simultaneously, a protease inhibitor&#8208;based coacervate is incorporated into the coating to inhibit the intrinsic pathway effectively. The loaded coacervate can be released and reloaded through modulation of catechol&#8208;amine interactions, facilitating material regeneration. The strategy offers a novel multi&#8208;scale mediation strategy that simultaneously inhibits nanoscale coagulation factors and resists microscale thrombus aggregation, providing a long&#8208;term solution for anticoagulation in blood&#8208;contacting devices.

         <title>Lysosome Targeted Nanoparticle Aggregation Reverses Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lysosomal swelling caused by excessive accumulation of undegraded substances, a lysosomal&#8208;targeting aggregated nanoparticle (LTANP) is synthesized for cancer treatment. By rationally engineering surface properties and interparticle interactions, LTANP enables targeted aggregation in lysosomes of cancer cells, leading to unrelievable lysosomal swelling, and ultimately selectively inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization and immunogenic cell death of cancer cells.








Abstract
Nanotechnology has proven its enormous application value in clinical practice. However, current research on nanomedicines mainly focuses on developing nanoparticles as delivery carriers to maximize the bioavailability of therapeutic agents, with little attention on exploring their potential to directly regulate physiological processes. In this study, inspired by the lysosomal swelling caused by excessive accumulation of undegraded substances, this work presents a lysosomal&#8208;targeting aggregated nanoparticle (LTANP) for cancer treatment. By rationally engineering surface composition, properties, and interparticle interactions, LTANP achieves efficient tumor accumulation and selective targeted aggregation in lysosomes of cancer cells, leading to unrelievable lysosomal swelling, and ultimately inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) of cancer cells. Further analysis shows that nanoparticle aggregation&#8208;mediated LMP can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) by impairing autophagy&#8208;lysosome pathway, evoking robust antitumor immune responses and reversing tumor immunogenicity from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221; in a melanoma model. Additionally, LTANP can combine with clinically approved programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibodies to further unleash T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, significantly enhancing antitumor performance, inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis. This work demonstrates the potential of rationally engineered nanostructures in directly combating cancer and provides novel insights for the development of advanced nanoparticle&#8208;based cancer treatment.

         <title>High Efficiency n&#8208;Type Doping of Organic Semiconductors by Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a high&#8208;efficiency n&#8208;type doping method for organic semiconductors through cation exchange, achieving high doping levels while preserving the material's structural integrity, thereby leading to high electrical conductivity. The method holds great potential for improving the performance of organic electronic devices, including thermoelectric and solar cells.








Abstract
Achieving efficient doping in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers is crucial for their application in electronic devices. In this study, an n&#8208;type doping method is developed based on cation exchange that maintains a high doping level while ensuring a high degree of structural order, leading to significantly improved electrical conductivity. By investigating various dopants and ionic liquids, it is discovered that the choice of dopant influences doping efficiency, while the selection of ionic liquid affects cation exchange efficiency. Through careful selection of suitable dopants and ionic liquids, High doping levels are achieved remarkably in a short period, resulting in the highest conductivity (nearly 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;) compared to other doping methods for poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200). The findings highlight the robustness and efficiency of cation exchange doping as an effective approach for achieving high&#8208;quality n&#8208;type doping in conjugated polymers, thereby opening new avenues for the development of advanced polymer&#8208;based electronic devices.

         <title>Insight into Carrier and Phonon Transports of PbSnS2 Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique carrier and phonon transport characteristics of PbSnS2 crystals are analyzed comprehensively. Both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type PbSnS2 crystals have the advantage of ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, but the differences in doping efficiency and charge density distribution lead to obviously distinct figure of merit (ZT) values and optimal performance directions. This work provides a solid foundation for subsequent research and device assembly.








Abstract
The simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type thermoelectric materials is advantageous to the practical application of the device. As an emerging thermoelectric material, PbSnS2 exhibits highly competitive thermoelectric properties due to its unique carrier and phonon transport characteristics. To promote the utilization of this low&#8208;cost thermoelectric material, p&#8208;type PbSnS2 crystals are synthesized and optimized through Na doping and Se alloying. The resulting thermoelectric transport properties differ significantly from those reported for n&#8208;type crystals, prompting us to compare and analyze both n&#8208;type (Cl&#8208;doped) and p&#8208;type (Na&#8208;doped) PbSnS2 crystals from various perspectives. Cl doping is subject to weaker &#8220;Fermi pinning&#8221; and lower impurity ionization energy compared with Na doping, leading to higher doping efficiency. The different optimal performance directions in n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type crystals can be attributed to the distinct charge density distributions near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM). Additionally, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type crystals exhibit ultralow lattice thermal conductivity due to the low symmetry of their twisted NaCl structure combined with the strong anharmonicity. This comprehensive analysis of PbSnS2 crystals provides a solid foundation for further performance optimization and device assembly, while also sheds light on the investigation of layered thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Dual Fe/I Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction and Wide&#8208;Temperature Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the fabrication of dual Fe/I single atoms anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR). Benefiting from the novel design of dual Fe/I single atoms and the structural advantages of 1D ultrafine nanorods, the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR catalyst delivers excellent oxygen reduction performance. In addition, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8208;40 to 60 &#176;C are realized for the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries. 








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are essential for widespread application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), but the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) suffer from low activity and stability because of unfavorable strong adsorption of oxygenated intermediates. Herein, the study synthesizes dual Fe/I single atoms anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR) via a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step tandem&#8208;pyrolysis method. Atomic&#8208;level I doping modulates the electronic structure of Fe&#8208;Nx centers via the long&#8208;range electron delocalization effect. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of dual Fe/I single&#8208;atom sites and the structural merits of 1D nanorods, the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR catalyst shows excellent ORR activity and stability, superior to Pt/C and Fe or I SACs. When the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR is employed as cathode for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs, a high power density of 197.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an ultralong cycling lifespan of 280&#160;h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 are both achieved, greatly exceeding those of commercial Pt/C+IrO2 (119.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and 47&#160;h). In addition, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability and superior stability from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C are realized for the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs. This work provides a MOF&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step tandem&#8208;pyrolysis strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance dual SACs with metal/nonmetal centers for ORR and sustainable ZABs.

         <title>Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Thermoelectric Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the development of shape&#8208;conformable and mechanically durable thermoelectric materials is essential for wearable electronics. It is demonstrated that flexible all&#8208;inorganic thermoelectric yarn can be produced through the interlayered deposition and thermal annealing of target materials, creating flexible semiconductors with versatile elements. This innovation paves the way for incorporating such yarns into everyday apparel, including sweaters and life jackets, functioning as thermoelectric generators and facilitating self&#8208;powered wearable devices.








Abstract
Achieving both formability and functionality in thermoelectric materials remains a significant challenge due to their inherent brittleness. Previous approaches, such as polymer infiltration, often compromise thermoelectric efficiency, underscoring the need for flexible, all&#8208;inorganic alternatives. This study demonstrates that the extreme brittleness of thermoelectric bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) bulk compounds can be overcome by harnessing the nanoscale flexibility of Bi2Te3 nanoribbons and twisting them into a yarn structure. The resulting Bi2Te3 yarn, with a Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;126.6&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1, exhibits remarkable deformability, enduring extreme bending curvatures (down to 0.5&#160;mm&#8722;1) and tensile strains of &#8776;5% through over 1000 cycles without significant resistance change. This breakthrough allows the yarn to be seamlessly integrated into various applications&#8212;wound around metallic pipes, embedded within life jackets, or woven into garments&#8212;demonstrating unprecedented adaptability and durability. Moreover, a simple 4&#8208;pair thermoelectric generator comprising Bi2Te3 yarns and metallic wires generates a maximum output voltage of 67.4&#160;mV, substantiating the effectiveness of thermoelectric yarns in waste heat harvesting. These advances not only challenge the traditional limitations posed by the brittleness of thermoelectric materials but also open new avenues for their application in wearable and structural electronics.

         <title>Accelerating Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion in LiFePO4 by Polyanion Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyanion lattice engineering strategy is applied on LiFePO4, with planar triangle BO33&#8722; substituting tetrahedron PO43&#8722; to induce more flexibility and provide additional paths between Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels. These synergetically contribute to accelerate the Li&#8208;ion diffusion, which have outstanding high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature battery performances. This method may be extended to the other polyanionic materials.








Abstract
Despite the widespread commercialization of LiFePO4 as cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the rigid 1D Li&#8208;ion diffusion channel along the [010] direction strongly limits its fast charge and discharge performance. Herein, lattice engineering is developed by the planar triangle BO33&#8722; substitution on tetrahedron PO43&#8722; to induce flexibility in the Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels, which are broadened simultaneously. The planar structure of BO33&#8722; may further provide additional paths between the channels. With these synergetic contributions, LiFe(PO4)0.98(BO3)0.02 shows the best performance, which delivers the high&#8208;rate capacity (66.8 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50 C) and long cycle stability (ultra&#8208;low capacity loss of 0.003% every cycle at 10 C) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, excellent rate performance (34.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 40 C) and capacity retention (no capacity loss after 2500 cycles at 10 C) at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C are realized.

         <title>Intertwined Flexoelectricity and Stacking Ferroelectricity in Marginally Twisted hBN Moir&#233; Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In marginally twisted hBN homojunction that form moir&#233; ferroelectric patterns, the lattice&#8208;mismatching induced flexoelectric effect can shape the domains to hollow triangular structures, while domains can be also modulated by natural bubbles and externally applied forces, demonstrating a new tuning knob to manipulate the moir&#233; ferroelectricity.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals homo/heterostructures present a fascinating interplay between electronic and atomic structures, with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Flexoelectricity, an electromechanical coupling between electric polarization and strain gradient, is intrinsic to these superlattices because of the lattice misfit strain at the atomic scale. However, due to its weak magnitude, the effect of flexoelectricity on moir&#233; ferroelectricity has remained underexplored. Here, the role of flexoelectricity in shaping and modulating the moir&#233; ferroelectric patterns in twisted hBN homojunction is unveiled. Enhanced flexoelectric effects induce unique stacking ferroelectric domains with hollow triangular structures. Interlayer bubbles influence domain shape and periodicity through local electric field modulation, and tip&#8208;stress enables the reversible manipulation of domain area and polarization direction. These findings highlight the impact of flexoelectric effects on moir&#233; ferroelectricity, offering a new tuning knob for its manipulation.

         <title>A Novel Upside&#8208;Down Thermal Annealing Method Toward High&#8208;Quality Active Layers Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel annealing method is proposed for preparing high&#8208;quality bulk heterojunction films by flipping the active layer, which can slow down the volatilization of casting solvent and refine the evolution of phase separation and crystalline orientation, thereby achieving small non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in several highly efficient organic solar cells.








Abstract
The emerging non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with low voltage losses have pushed the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) to &#8776;20% with auxiliary morphology optimization. Thermal annealing (TA), as the most widely adopted post&#8208;treatment method, has been playing an essential role in realizing the potential of various material systems. However, the procedure of TA, i.e., the way that TA is performed, is almost identical among thousands of OSC papers since &#8776;30 years ago other than changes in temperature and annealing time. Herein, a reverse thermal annealing (RTA) technique is developed, which can enhance the dielectric constant of active layer film, thereby producing a smaller Coulomb capture radius (14.93 nm), meanwhile, forming a moderate nano&#8208;scale phase aggregation and a more favorable face&#8208;on molecular stacking orientation. Thus, this method can reduce the decline in open circuit voltage of the conventional TA method by achieving decreased radiative (0.334 eV) and non&#8208;radiative (0.215 eV) recombination loss. The power conversion efficiency of the RTA PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X device increases to 19.91% (certified 19.42%) compared to the TA device (18.98%). It is shown that this method exhibits a superb universality in 4 other material systems, revealing its dramatic potential to be employed in a wide range of OSCs.

         <title>A Dynamic H&#8208;Bonding Network Enables Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Color&#8208;Tunable Chiral Afterglow Polymer for 4D Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks is proposed to create stimuli&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials, offering precise control over both color and lifetime. These materials pave the way for the development of advanced optical information displays and sophisticated 4D encryption systems, significantly enhancing the functionality and adaptability of optoelectronic information systems.








Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive and color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials has attracted great attention but remains a daunting challenge. Here, a simple yet effective strategy through the construction of a dynamic H&#8208;bonding network is proposed to explore the multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow by doping a self&#8208;designed chiral phosphorescent chromophore into a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. A stimuli&#8208;responsive deep blue chiral afterglow system with a lifetime of up to 3.35 s, quantum yield of 25.0%, and luminescent dissymmetry factor of up to 0.05 is achieved through reversible formation and breakdown of the H&#8208;bonding network upon thermal&#8208;heating and water&#8208;fumigating. Moreover, multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow can be obtained by chiral and afterglow energy transfer, allowing the establishment of afterglow information displays and high&#8208;level 4D encryption. This work not only offers a facile platform to develop advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive materials but also opens a new avenue for developing next&#8208;generation optical information technology with enhanced functionality and responsiveness.

Abstract
RETRACTION: G. M. Jonaid, W. J. Dearnaley, M. A. Casasanta, L. Kaylor, S. Berry, M. J. Dukes, M. S. Spilman, J. L. Gray and D. F. Kelly, &#8220;High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets,&#8221; Advanced Materials 33, no. 37 (2021): 2103221, https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202103221.
The above article, published online on 24 July 2021 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the author, M. S. Spilman; the journal Editors&#8208;in&#8208;Chief, Irem Bayindir&#8208;Buchhalter and Esther Levy; and Wiley&#8208;VCH GmbH. The retraction has been agreed upon following a thorough peer review process conducted by the author's institution, Penn State University. The peer review determined that there is no significant correlation between the EM map and the model at any resolution. Furthermore, the validation curves and the published curves significantly misrepresent the fit of models to EM maps. The authors did&#160;not provide their original research data, EM maps, and models included in the study, to justify their findings. As a result, the institution recommends the article be retracted. The editors of the journal agree with these findings as they are supported by their own independent investigation. The author, D.F. Kelly, disagrees with the retraction; G.M. Jonaid agrees with the retraction; the other authors were unavailable for comment.

Compositional Site Disorder Enables Engineering Oxide Phase Transitions
Work by Elliot J. Fuller and co&#8208;workers demonstrates that tunable disorder in a crystal can be quite useful: compositional site disorder was used to modify oxide semiconductors by changing the carrier type, improving crystallinity and tuning a spin transition. Applications include electrothermal thresholding devices such as radio frequency limiters. More details can be found in article number 2406885.

Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Devices
In article number 2403624, Yuyan Wang, Cheng Song, Feng Pan, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the controllable photoresponse by magnetic fields in 2D optoelectronic devices at room temperature. The magneto&#8208;photoresponse is achieved by using 2D magnets with the magneto&#8208;band structure effect as the contacts, which is applicable to realize reconfigurable photodetectors for in&#8208;sensor computing. This finding shows a new perspective for constructing in&#8208;sensor machine vision systems with gate&#8208;free architectures.

Metastable CoCu2O3 Nanocrystals
In article number 2408888, Andreas T. G&#252;ntner, Matteo D'Andria, and colleagues present a method for kinetically trapping metastable, high&#8208;temperature oxide nanocrystals through combustion&#8208;aerosol techniques. The cover illustration symbolizes the delicate process of capturing and preserving these nanocrystals without &#8220;falling into the canyon&#8221; of thermodynamically stable crystal phases. Successfully navigating this &#8220;canyon&#8221;, researchers can harness the unique properties of metastable nanocrystals that hold great potential for energy storage, molecular sensing, and catalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202408888"&gt;2408888&lt;/a&gt;, Andreas T. G&#252;ntner, Matteo D'Andria, and colleagues present a method for kinetically trapping metastable, high-temperature oxide nanocrystals through combustion-aerosol techniques. The cover illustration symbolizes the delicate process of capturing and preserving these nanocrystals without &#8220;falling into the canyon&#8221; of thermodynamically stable crystal phases. Successfully navigating this &#8220;canyon&#8221;, researchers can harness the unique properties of metastable nanocrystals that hold great potential for energy storage, molecular sensing, and catalytic applications.

         <title>Blueprints of Architected Materials: A Guide to Metamaterial Design for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected structures with extraordinary properties, which are defined by their unit cell geometry. Although metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering, their complex design limits their wider use. This review acts as a guide detailing design principles and geometric parameters crucial for metamaterial design, while showcasing applications in tissue engineering, to facilitate metamaterial use in the field.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are rationally designed structures engineered to exhibit extraordinary properties, often surpassing those of their constituent materials. The geometry of metamaterials&#8217; building blocks, referred to as unit cells, plays an essential role in determining their macroscopic mechanical behavior. Due to their hierarchical design and remarkable properties, metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering; however their implementation in the field remains limited. The major challenge hindering the broader use of metamaterials lies in the complexity of unit cell design and fabrication. To address this gap, a comprehensive guide is presented detailing the design principles of well&#8208;established metamaterials. The essential unit cell geometric parameters and design constraints, as well as their influence on mechanical behavior, are summarized highlighting essential points for effective fabrication. Moreover, the potential integration of artificial intelligence techniques is explored in meta&#8208;biomaterial design for patient&#8208; and application&#8208;specific design. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of current applications of mechanical metamaterials is provided in tissue engineering, categorized by tissue type, thereby showcasing the versatility of different designs in matching the mechanical properties of the target tissue. This review aims to provide a valuable resource for tissue engineering researchers and aid in the broader use of metamaterials in the field.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Li Metal Batteries: Feasibility Analysis and Practical Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs), with lithiated cathodes, offer theoretical max energy density but suffer from poor deposition efficiency, active material loss, crosstalk and volume change. This study reviews progress in AFLMBs, analyzing their performance and challenges. Strategies for addressing deposition issues and enhancing battery components are presented, with a vision for their future applications.








Abstract
Energy storage devices are striving to achieve high energy density, long lifespan, and enhanced safety. In view of the current popular lithiated cathode, anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) will deliver the theoretical maximum energy density among all the battery chemistries. However, AFLMBs face challenges such as low plating&#8208;stripping efficiency, significant volume change, and severe Li&#8208;dendrite growth, which negatively impact their lifespan and safety. This study provides an overview and analysis of recent progress in electrode structure, characterization, performance, and practical challenges of AFLMBs. The deposition behavior of lithium is categorized into two stages: heterogeneous and homogeneous interface deposition. The feasibility and practical application value of AFLMBs are critically evaluated. Additionally, key test models, evaluation parameters, and advanced characterization techniques are discussed. Importantly, practical strategies of different battery components in AFLMBs, including current collector, interface layer, solid&#8208;state electrolyte, liquid&#8208;state electrolyte, cathode, and cycling protocol, are presented to address the challenges posed by the two types of deposition processes, lithium loss, crosstalk effect and volume change. Finally, the application prospects of AFLMBs are envisioned, with a focus on overcoming the current limitations and unlocking their full potential as high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Zinc Chemistries of Hybrid Electrolytes in Zinc Metal Batteries: From Solvent Structure to Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic solvent structures, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in hybrid electrolytes, which consist of aqueous solution, multiple ions, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent, are systematically elaborated and reviewed. The scotoma and amelioration strategies for designing current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited as well.








Abstract
Along with the booming research on zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) in recent years, operational issues originated from inferior interfacial reversibility have become inevitable. Presently, single&#8208;component electrolytes represented by aqueous solution, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent system are hard to undertake independently the task of guiding the practical application of ZMBs due to their specific limitations. The hybrid electrolytes modulate microscopic interaction mode between Zn2+ and other ions/molecules, integrating vantage of respective electrolyte systems. They even demonstrate original Zn2+ mobility pattern or interfacial chemistries mechanism distinct from single&#8208;component electrolytes, providing considerable opportunities for solving electromigration and interfacial problems in ZMBs. Therefore, it is urgent to comprehensively summarize the zinc chemistries principles, characteristics, and applications of various hybrid electrolytes employed in ZMBs. This review begins with elucidating the chemical bonding mode of Zn2+ and interfacial physicochemical theory, and then systematically elaborates the microscopic solvent structure, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and the zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in each type of hybrid electrolytes. Among of which, the scotoma and amelioration strategies for the current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited, expecting to provide referenceable insights for further progress of future high&#8208;quality ZMBs.

         <title>Advancing Scaffold&#8208;Assisted Modality for In Situ Osteochondral Regeneration: A Shift From Biodegradable to Bioadaptable</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osteochondral repair remains a substantial yet elusive challenge, despite decades of efforts on surgical and tissue engineering approaches. This review introduces the frontier trend of cell&#8208;free, scaffold&#8208;assisted modality for in situ osteochondral regeneration. Recent research advances in scaffold&#8208;based engineering are systematically discussed, tailoring a design paradigm evolving from biodegradability to inadaptability, with future directions toward precision medicine and smart healthcare. ECM: Extracellular Matrix; MGE: Materials Genome Engineering; AI: Artificial Intelligence.








Abstract
Over the decades, the management of osteochondral lesions remains a significant yet unmet medical challenge without curative solutions to date. Owing to the complex nature of osteochondral units with multi&#8208;tissues and multicellularity, and inherently divergent cellular turnover capacities, current clinical practices often fall short of robust and satisfactory repair efficacy. Alternative strategies, particularly tissue engineering assisted with biomaterial scaffolds, achieve considerable advances, with the emerging pursuit of a more cost&#8208;effective approach of in situ osteochondral regeneration, as evolving toward cell&#8208;free modalities. By leveraging endogenous cell sources and innate regenerative potential facilitated with instructive scaffolds, promising results are anticipated and being evidenced. Accordingly, a paradigm shift is occurring in scaffold development, from biodegradable and biocompatible to bioadaptable in spatiotemporal control. Hence, this review summarizes the ongoing progress in deploying bioadaptable criteria for scaffold&#8208;based engineering in endogenous osteochondral repair, with emphases on precise control over the scaffolding material, degradation, structure and biomechanics, and surface and biointerfacial characteristics, alongside their distinguished impact on the outcomes. Future outlooks of a highlight on advanced, frontier materials, technologies, and tools tailoring precision medicine and smart healthcare are provided, which potentially paves the path toward the ultimate goal of complete osteochondral regeneration with function restoration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 47, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen electrocatalysis acts as a pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, while the sluggish dynamic behavior restricts their development and device applications. This review deeply analyzes the structure&#8211;activity relationships (including geometric morphology and chemical structures) of oxygen electrocatalysts by combining experimental results, advanced characterizations, and theoretical simulations, favorably promoting the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Oxygen electrocatalysis, as the pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, sets off a worldwide research boom in full swing, while its large kinetic obstacles require remarkable catalysts to break through. Here, based on summarizing reaction mechanisms and in situ characterizations, the structure&#8211;activity relationships of oxygen electrocatalysts are emphatically overviewed, including the influence of geometric morphology and chemical structures on the electrocatalytic performances. Subsequently, experimental/theoretical research is combined with device applications to comprehensively summarize the cutting&#8208;edge oxygen electrocatalysts according to various material categories. Finally, future challenges are forecasted from the perspective of catalyst development and device applications, favoring researchers to promote the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis at an early date.

         <title>Vertical&#8208;Structure Overcomes the Strain Limit of Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces vertical, intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (VIS&#8208;OECTs), which overcome the strain limitation of intrinsically stretchable semiconductors through 3D structure engineering. The VIS&#8208;OECTs exhibit enhanced stretchability (50% strain) compared to the reference planar&#8208;structured IS&#8208;OECTs (20% strain) and show over a hundredfold improvement in transconductance.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (IS&#8208;OECTs), utilizing organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as their channel materials, have drawn great attention recently because of their potential to enable seamless integration between bioelectronic devices and living systems. However, the fabrication of IS&#8208;OECTs presents challenges due to the limited availability of OMIEC materials that possess the desired combination of mechanical and electrical properties. In this work, 1) we report the first successful fabrication of a vertical intrinsically stretchable OECT (VIS&#8208;OECT), achieved by using elastoadhesive electrodes; 2) we experimentally proved&#160;that vertical architecture can push the strain limit of an IS&#8208;OECT from 20% to 50%; and 3) the above finding introduces an unconventional design concept: the strain limit of an IS&#8208;OECT can surpass the intrinsic stretchability of the constituent OMIECs by employing vertical structure.

         <title>Ferroelectric Perovskite/MoS2 Channel Heterojunctions for Wide&#8208;Window Nonvolatile Memory and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the family of 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors into heterostructures channel field&#8208;effect transistors, the devices can achieve robust storage characteristics and intriguing carrier polarity modulation behavior, thereby holding promise for applications in medical diagnostics and beyond.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials commonly serve as gate insulators in typical field&#8208;effect transistors, where their polarization reversal enables effective modulation of the conductivity state of the channel material, thereby realizing non&#8208;volatile memory. Currently, novel 2D ferroelectrics unlock new prospects in next&#8208;generation electronics and neuromorphic computation. However, the advancement of these materials is impeded by limited selectivity and narrow memory windows. Here, new concepts of 2D ferroelectric perovskite/MoS2 channel heterostructures field&#8208;effect transistors are presented, in which 2D ferroelectric perovskite features customizable band structure, few&#8208;layered ferroelectricity, and submillimeter&#8208;size monolayer wafers. Further studies reveal that these devices exhibit unique charge polarity modulation (from n&#8208; to p&#8208;type channel) and remarkable nonvolatile memory behavior, especially record&#8208;wide hysteresis windows up to 177&#160;V, which enables efficient imitation of biological synapses and achieves high recognition accuracy for electrocardiogram patterns. This result provides a device paradigm for future nonvolatile memory and artificial synaptic applications.

         <title>High Electrical Conductance in Magnetic Emission Junction of Fe3GeTe2/ZnO/Ni Heterostructure via Selective Spin Emission through ZnO Ohmic Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;conductance magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated using an Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322;/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, where the ZnO barrier forms an Ohmic contact, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission. Unlike conventional magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs), the MEJ exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) through minority spin emission, achieving up to 10&#8211;1000 times higher conductance while maintaining a comparable MR ratio to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.








Abstract
The insulator is essential for magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) that increases magnetoresistance (MR) by decoupling magnetization directions between two ferromagnets. However, wide bandgap tunnel barrier blocks the thermionic emission of electrons, significantly reducing electrical conductance through MTJ. Here, a magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated for the first time using an Fe3GeTe2 (FGT)/ZnO/Ni heterostructure with very high electrical conductance. The conduction band of ZnO (electron affinity 4.6&#160;eV) aligns with Fermi levels (EF) of FGT (4.47&#160;eV) and Ni (4.58&#160;eV) ferromagnets and forms an Ohmic barrier, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission through ZnO barrier and high electrical conductance. In contrast to the typical positive MR in MTJ by majority spin tunneling, negative MR is observed in FGT/ZnO/Ni MEJ. The minority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states near the EF, are dominantly emitted to FGT over the ZnO barrier, while majority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states below the EF, are blocked by it. In the FGT/FGT/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, the MR ratio is further increased by combining positive and negative MR at the MTJ (FGT/FGT) and MEJ (FGT/ZnO/Ni), respectively. As a result, FGT&#8208;MEJ exhibits 10&#8211;1000 orders higher conductance than other 2D&#8208;MTJs, while MR ratio remains similar to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Assisted Dry Coating Electrode Unlocking Sustainable and High&#8208;Performance Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;assistant dry coating approach is reported for solvent&#8208;free preparation of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) electrodes. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as key mediators for Li+ transport, and the melting of SN&#8208;LiDFOB can significantly improve the distribution of electrode components. The resulting LMR electrodes exhibit a remarkable energy density and rate capability.








Abstract
Current battery production relies on the use of large amounts of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidnone (NMP) solvent during electrode preparation, which raises serious concerns in material cost, energy consumption, and toxicity, thus demanding the innovation of dry electrodes with excellent performance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dry electrodes show inferior energy densities, particularly under high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity and fast charge/discharge conditions required for practical applications. Here dry production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) cathodes is shown based on a thermal&#8208;assistant approach. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as two key electrode mediators to facilitate Li+ transport, and the mild heating process for melting SN&#8208;LiDFOB has significantly improved the distribution of various components in the electrode. These synergistic effects enable dry LMR cathodes with a maximum rate capability of 4 C (12 mA cm&#8722;2) and an areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The resulting Li metal/LMR full cell exhibits the maximum energy and power densities of 609&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2,183&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively, based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. These results not only break through the key bottleneck in energy density for dry electrodes but, in a broader context, open a new avenue for green and sustainable battery production.

         <title>Subtle Tuning of Catalytic Well Effect in Phthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective CO2 Electroreduction into C2H4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu&#8208;salphen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with different levels of hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well have been designed for selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction into multiple&#8208;electron transferred products.








Abstract
In the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the strategic design of a catalytic well capable of regulating the overall confinement effects of catalytic sites holds significant promise for enhancing multiple&#8208;electron transfer and C&#9472;C coupling efficiency, particularly for the generation of C2+ products. Here, a series of Cu&#8208;salphen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well are synthesized, which demonstrate successful application in electrocatalytic CO2RR to yield multiple&#8208;electron transferred products. The meticulously engineered catalytic well, facilitated by multi&#8208;hydroxyl groups, manifests robust confinement effects, facilitating selective adsorption, enrichment, and activation of CO2, intermediate stabilization, and reduction of energy barriers for electrocatalytic CO2RR. Specifically, product selectivity can be finely tuned from CH4 to C2H4 by modulating the levels of catalytic well, with CuPc&#8208;DFP&#8208;4OH&#8208;Cu exhibiting the most pronounced catalytic well effect, yielding a high 56.86% faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4 at &#8722;0.7 V, while CuPc&#8208;DFP&#8208;Cu, with the weakest catalytic well effect, achieves a 75.24% FE for CH4 at &#8722;1.0 V. Notably, the attained FE for C2H4 (56.86%) surpasses that of all reported COFs to date. Complemented by theoretical calculations and in situ tests, this study delves deeply into the pivotal roles of hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well with confinement effects.

         <title>Reversible Anion&#8208;Cation Relay&#8208;Intercalation in a T&#8208;MnO2 Cathode to Boost the Efficiency of Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The t&#8208;MnO2 cathode with an Mg&#8208;ion stabilized 3&#160;&#215;&#160;3 large&#8208;tunnel structure can withstand large structural deformation during the reversible anion&#8211;cation (SO42&#8722;&#8211;Zn2+/H+) intercalation. The SO42&#8722; and Zn2+&#8208;based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery system delivered a high reversible capacity of 398 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with an output voltage of &#8776;1.41 V and more than 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of intrinsic safety, high power density, environmental friendliness, and high&#8208;output voltage, aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) have shown broad potential applications in future grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, since the ADIBs require the cathodes to undergo the intercalation reactions through different local structures and mechanisms, causing large structural deformation and cathode failure, their reversible cation&#8208;anion intercalation in the cathode remains a major challenge. To address this issue, based on a reasonable selection and theoretical simulation, this work finds that Todorokite manganese dioxide (t&#8208;MnO2) cathode with a metal&#8208;ion stabilized 3&#160;&#215;&#160;3 large&#8208;tunnel structure should be suitable for cation&#8208;anion intercalation of ADIBs. The comprehensive characterizations confirm that the unique tunnel structure of the t&#8208;MnO2 cathode can withstand large structural deformation during the sulfate radical anion&#8211; zinc/proton cation (SO42&#8722;&#8211;Zn2+/H+) intercalation. Due to the intercalation of SO42&#8722;, the ADIB delivered a high reversible capacity of 398&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with an output voltage of &#8776;1.41 V, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity (308&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) of Zn&#8208;MnO2 based Zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides the design principles for ADIBs cathode materials and demonstrates that t&#8208;MnO2 can be a promising cathode material for high&#8208;performance ADIBs.

         <title>Screening Fluorination Additives for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep investigation is conducted to evaluate the impact of diverse fluorinated additives on the domain distribution within the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite. By utilizing the fluorinated additive with minimal dipole moment, the undesirable small&#8208;n domain is successfully inhibited, which enables the fabrication of efficient PeLED with an impressive EQE of 20.38% at 488&#160;nm.








Abstract
Fluorinated additives are proposed to address the issue of domain polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. However, the lack of established screening criteria for these additives necessitates a laborious and costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process. Herein, this work explores the behind nature for the first time how various fluorination in fluorinated additives affect domain distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The studies reveal that fully fluorinated additives could suppress undesirable low&#8208;dimensional domains, facilitating efficient energy transfer, while partially fluorinated additives adversely cause deteriorated optical properties. The observed trend is ascribed to the molecular dipole moment of the fluorinated additives, offering a reasonable explanation for experimental phenomena that has never been reported before. By employing fully fluorinated additives, the fabricated sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) deliver a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.38% (@488&#160;nm), marking as one of the highest efficiencies reported to date. The finding provides a screening criterion for fluorinated additives to realize efficient PeLEDs.

         <title>Hardware&#8208;Feasible and Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Neuromorphic Signal Recognition via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic electrochemical synaptic transistor (n&#8208;OEST) is integrated within a simple and hardware&#8208;feasible reservoir computing (RC) framework, enabling efficient recognition of complex signals. This physical RC comprises n&#8208;OESTs for both adaptive reservoirs and single&#8208;layer readout. It achieves image and speech recognition with &gt;90% accuracy and snoring recognition with 98.0% accuracy for practical sleep monitoring.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OESTs), inspired by the biological nervous system, have garnered increasing attention due to their multifunctional applications in neuromorphic computing. However, the practical implementation of OESTs for signal recognition&#8212;particularly those utilizing n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs)&#8212;still faces significant challenges at the hardware level. Here, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type OEST integrated within a physically simple and hardware feasible reservoir&#8208;computing (RC) framework for practical temporal signal recognition is presented. This integration is achieved by leveraging the adjustable synaptic properties of the n&#8208;OEST, which exhibits tunable nonlinear short&#8208;term memory, transitioning from volatility to nonvolatility, and demonstrating adaptive temporal specificity. Additionally, the nonvolatile OEST offers 256 conductance levels and a wide dynamic range (&#8776;147) in long&#8208;term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), surpassing previously reported n&#8208;OESTs. By combining volatile n&#8208;OESTs as reservoirs with a single&#8208;layer perceptron readout composed of nonvolatile n&#8208;OEST networks, this physical RC system achieves substantial recognition accuracy for both handwritten&#8208;digit images (94.9%) and spoken digit (90.7%), along with ultrahigh weight efficiency. Furthermore, this system demonstrates outstanding accuracy (98.0%) by grouped RC in practical sleep monitoring, specifically in snoring recognition. Here, a reliable pathway for OMIEC&#8208;driven computing is presented to advance bioinspired hardware&#8208;based neuromorphic computing in the physical world.

         <title>Development of an Inhalable DNA Tetrahedron MicroRNA Sponge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetrahedral&#8208;like configuration of microRNA&#8208;155 Sponge (155&#8208;Sponge) enters the lungs by nebulization, releasing a 3 fold concentration of microRNA&#8208;155 (miR&#8208;155) inhibitor that binds to miR&#8208;155, which is highly expressed in the inflammation of the lungs, to regulate the polarization state of the local macrophages in the lungs and the chemotaxis of the immune cells, and to restore the immunological homeostatic microenvironment in the lungs.








Abstract
In designing aerosolized drugs, the challenge lies in achieving optimal penetration and retention. Existing delivery systems prioritize larger particles for prolonged intrapulmonary retention, compromising penetration speed. Conversely, smaller nanoparticles face rapid clearance and limited retention. RNA sponges featuring multiple microRNA binding sites exhibit promising potential for gene expression regulation. However, the complex structure of the frequently utilized cyclic RNA sponge impedes rapid penetration and cellular uptake, restricting its application. This study proposes an innovative approach using a compact tetrahedral framework of nucleic acid to construct an inhalable microRNA sponge. Distinguished by its simplified structure, this microRNA sponge ensures effective microRNA inhibition, rapid tissue penetration, and prolonged residency through prompt endocytosis. Validated in acute lung inflammation models, the approach demonstrates swift restoration of local immune homeostasis. This design addresses the critical need for aerosol vehicles that balance efficient penetration and sustained retention, offering a promising solution for effective gene expression regulation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional hydrogel fibers for Biointerfacing: Functional hydrogel fibers are designed with optical guiding capabilities, electrical conductivity, and responsiveness to various physical stimuli (e.g., thermal, magnetic, and ultrasound waves), enabling their use in biointerfacing&#160;applications.









Abstract
The unique 1D structure of fibers offers intriguing attributes, including a high length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter ratio, miniatured size, light&#8208;weight, and flexibility, making them suitable for various biomedical applications, such as health monitoring, disease treatment, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, traditional fiber devices, typically composed of rigid, dry, and non&#8208;living materials, are intrinsically different from the soft, wet, and living essence of biological tissues, thereby posing grand challenges for long&#8208;term, reliable, and seamless interfacing with biological systems. Hydrogel fibers have recently emerged as a promising candidate, in light of their similarity to biological tissues in mechanical, chemical and biological aspects, as well as distinct fiber geometry. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent progress in hydrogel fibers&#8208;based biointerfacing technology is provided. It thoroughly summarizes the manufacturing strategy and functional design, especially for hydrogel fibers with distinct optical and electron conductive performance, as well as responsiveness to triggers including thermal, magnetic field and ultrasonic wave, etc. Such unique attributes enable various biomedical applications, which are also examined in detail. Future challenges and potential directions, including biosafety, long&#8208;term reliability, sterilization, multi&#8208;modalities integration and intelligent therapeutic systems, are raised. This review will serve as a valuable resource for further advancement and implementation as next&#8208;generation biointerfacing technology.

         <title>Synthesis&#8208;Structure&#8208;Property of High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode for Li/Na/K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Increasing demand for rechargeable batteries necessitates improvements in electrochemical performance. Traditional optimal approaches such as elemental doping and surface modification are insufficient for practical applications of the batteries. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) possess stable solid&#8208;state phases and unparalleled flexibility in composition and electronic structure, which facilitate rapid advancements in battery materials. This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship. Furthermore, it outlines future directions for high&#8208;entropy strategies in battery study: precise synthesis control, understanding of reaction mechanisms through structural characterization, elucidation of structure&#8208;performance correlations, and the computational and experimental methods integration for rapid screening and analysis of HEMs. The perspective aims to inspire researchers in the development of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries.

Furthermore, it outlines future directions for high-entropy strategies in battery study: precise synthesis control, understanding of reaction mechanisms through structural characterization, elucidation of structure-performance correlations, and the computational and experimental methods integration for rapid screening and analysis of HEMs. The perspective aims to inspire researchers in the development of high-performance rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Readout Silicon&#8208;Based Microtube Photodetectors for Encrypted Visible Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetectors are designed for Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication reception. The device enable effective photodetection and rapid readout, resulting in a 75&#160;ns response time and 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity. The photodetector achieves a 140&#176; field of view and dichroic ratio up to 16.09, offering the potential in internet of things and information security.








Abstract
The implementation of an advanced light receiver is imperative for the widespread application of visible light communication. However, the integration of multifunctional and high&#8208;performance visible light receivers is still limited by device structure and system complexity. Herein, a graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetector is proposed as the receiver for omnidirectional Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication. The integration of graphene&#8208;semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light&#8208;trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.

         <title>Efficient PFAS Removal Using Reusable and Non&#8208;Toxic 3D Printed Porous Trianglamine Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, trianglamine, a class of Schiff base macrocycles is used. Combining with pluronic to design by stereolithography process, a novel 3D&#8208;Porous Hydrogel (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;) is made. This innovative material, with no fluoride groups, is capable of picking up a broad spectrum of PFAS from aqueous solutions via fast kinetics. This new adsorbent is non&#8208;toxic, cheap, stable, and scalable.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now a paramount concern in water remediation. Nowadays, urgent action is required for the development of advanced technologies aimed at capturing PFAS and mitigating their impact. To offer a solution, a functional 3D printed hydrogel tailored is designed to trap a broad spectrum of PFAS contaminants. The hydrogel is made of a photo&#8208;crosslinked dimethacrylate&#8208;ureido&#8208;trianglamine (DMU&#8208;&#916;) and Pluronic P123 dimethacrylate (PDM) fabricated by stereolithography (SLA). With the aid of 3D&#8208;printing, porous and nonporous hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;, 3D&#8208;SH&#916;) as well as quaternized hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;Q+) are prepared. These tailored hydrogels, show high uptake capacities and fast removal kinetics for PFAS from aqueous sources. The PFAS removal efficiency of these hydrogels are then compared to P123 hydrogels with no trianglamine (3D&#8208;SH). The 3D&#8208;SH hydrogel shows no affinity to PFAS, proving that the sorption is due to the interaction between the trianglamine (&#916;) and PFAS. Metadynamic simulations also confirmed this interaction. The porous matrices showed the fastest and highest uptake capacity. 3D&#8208;PSH&#916; is able to capture &#8776; 91% of PFAS within 5 h using initial concentrations of 5 and 0.5 ppm in both deionized and river water. The sorption of PFAS is further enhanced by introducing permanent positive charges to the structure of the porous hydrogels, resulting in even faster sorption kinetics for both long and short PFAS chains with diverse polar heads. Besides the remarkable efficiency in capturing PFAS, these designed hydrogels are non&#8208;toxic and have outstanding chemical and thermal stability, making them a brilliant candidate for mass use in the combat against PFAS pollution.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights Into the Thermal Stability of High&#8208;Entropy Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ transmission electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations are combined to investigate the thermal behavior of FCC AuCoCuNiPt nanoparticles from 298 to 973 K. The formation and melting of an AuCu layer at the surface of nanostructures are revealed at high temperatures, shedding new light on the structural properties and thermal stability of high&#8208;entropy nanoalloys.








Abstract
High entropy alloy nanoparticles bring hope to developing more efficient nanomaterials for high&#8208;temperature applications. Nevertheless, the enhanced thermal stability of nearly equiatomic nanoalloys containing at least 5 metals is nothing more than theoretical speculation about the impact of thermodynamic contributions on their structural properties and remains to be proven. Here, in situ aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and molecular dynamics simulations are combined to investigate at the atomic scale the thermal behavior of AuCoCuNiPt nanoparticles (NPs) from 298 to 973 K. Both in situ STEM heating and atomistic simulations reveal strong structural and chemical evolutions in the NPs with the formation and melting of an AuCu layer at the surface of NPs at high temperature. This phase separation that appears progressively with temperature is driven by pronounced atomic diffusion that is surprisingly more active in these quinary nanoalloys than in monometallic and bimetallic subsystems. Besides ruling out the existence of sluggish diffusion in AuCoCuNiPt nanoalloys and lowering their temperature range of application, the study allows distinguishing kinetic and thermodynamic effects on their structural properties, which is an essential prerequisite to better control the synthesis of complex nanomaterials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hollow Gyroids with Bicontinuous Mesostructures: A Highly Robust Electrocatalyst Fixation Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow gyroid carbon (HGC), synthesized via the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers and vapor pressure&#8208;induced hollow structuring, provides a robust platform for embedding Pt nanoparticles. The HGC morphology facilitates efficient mass transport while the pyridine N inherent in the block copolymer enhances electrical conductivity and electrochemical durability, leading to outstanding performance in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The electrochemical degradation of Pt/C in commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is a major challenge that limits their durability and performance. This degradation mainly arises from carbon corrosion, which facilitates the detachment of electrocatalyst particles that are weakly bound to catalyst supports. Herein, unusually robust hollow gyroid morphologies designed for strong electrocatalyst fixation and extensive surface accessibility during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are reported. To obtain self&#8208;assembled gyroid nanostructures using a poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP) block copolymer, a solvent vapour treatment with dimethylformamide, which is highly selective for the P2VP block, is applied. It is discovered that retaining residual solvent in the gyroid&#8208;forming P2VP microdomain before carbonization is crucial for forming hollow gyroids with embedded electrocatalysts. These hollow gyroid carbon&#8208;Pt (HGC&#8208;Pt) nanostructures exhibit a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in electrochemically active surface area compared to solid gyroid carbon (SGC) counterparts. Based on systematic analyses, this exceptional electrochemical stability is attributed to greatly enhanced surface accessibility derived from the hollow geometry, uniform and robust catalyst embedding, and extensive pyridinic nitrogen doping from the P2VP block.

         <title>Trace Adsorptive Removal of PFAS from Water by Optimizing the UiO&#8208;66 MOF Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a prototypal platform of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer&#8211;MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record&#8208;high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest&#8208;accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.








Abstract
The confluence of pervasiveness, bioaccumulation, and toxicity in freshwater contaminants presents an environmental threat second to none. Exemplifying this trifecta, per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present an alarming hazard among the emerging contaminants. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PFAS adsorbents used in drinking water treatment, namely, activated carbons and ion&#8208;exchange resins, are handicapped by low adsorption capacity, competitive adsorption, and/or slow kinetics. To overcome these shortcomings, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored pore size, surface, and pore chemistry are promising alternatives. Thanks to the compositional modularity of MOFs and polymer&#8211;MOF composites, herein we report on a series of water&#8208;stable zirconium carboxylate MOFs and their low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;grafted composites as C8&#8211;PFAS adsorbents with benchmark kinetics and &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal efficiencies. Bespoke insights into the structure&#8211;function relationships of PFAS adsorbents are obtained by leveraging interfacial design principles on solid sorbents, creating a synergy between the extrinsic particle surfaces and intrinsic molecular building blocks.

&lt;p&gt;Using a prototypal platform of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer&#8211;MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record-high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest-accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules as Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Thermally Evaporated High&#8208;Efficiency Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

New dual&#8208;function SAMs are developed by employing strong electron withdrawing groups and anchoring group the phosphonic acid. C&#8208;2PACz&#8208;based thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs obtains a champion EQE of 10.41% @65.59 cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold immense potential for future applications in the display industry. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far behind, one of the most important reasons is the lack of suitable hole&#8208;transporting materials. Herein, the study designs and synthesizes a new class of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials, namely, (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (C&#8208;2PACz) and (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid&#160;(S&#8208;2PACz). First, the phosphonic acid is induced to form bidentate bonds with ITO. Second, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are integrated to increase the electron cloud density of the termini contacting with perovskite, which enhances the electrostatic interaction with the Pb2+, reduces the interfacial defects. These advantages improve their carrier transport ability and reduce the non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Meanwhile, it is found that compound C&#8208;2PACz possessing the smaller steric hindrance makes the SAMs have a&#160;more homogeneous film and a&#160;better interfacial passivation effect. By employing C&#8208;2PACz as hole&#8208;transporting layer in blue PeLEDs with metal halides as the emitting layer, the device exhibits a high brightness (1843&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (10.41% @65.59&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), which among the best of reported thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs. The work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.

         <title>Aggregate Science: from Molecules, beyond Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of AIE elucidates that the structure&#8211;property relationships at the single molecular level are not always idoneous when expanded to an aggregate state. Aggregate science, from a philosophical viewpoint, emphasizes a holistic approach to explore such relationships, underlining it comes from molecules but beyond molecules.








Abstract
Over the past centuries, molecular science has played a dominant role in the advancement of physical science by exploring the structure&#8211;property relationships at a single molecular level. However, when molecules form aggregates, a dilemma arises as the structures and properties often differ significantly from those of molecular constituents. To address this, the concept of aggregate science emphasizes a holistic approach to understanding the structures&#8211;properties relationship of substances. Despite the recognition of holism in aggregate research, there are still challenges in investigating the complex operations and interplays, particularly in understanding the newly emergent structures and properties in the macroscopic world. Therefore, there is a need to further advance the concept and methodology. In this regard, this perspective highlights three types of influences that aggregation exerts on substance properties: activation, transformation, and emergence. Furthermore, examples from aggregation&#8208;induced emission research and related fields are provided to illustrate how aggregate science can be studied. This perspective emphasizes that the molecule is of significance and the structures and properties are also dramatically influenced by aggregation. Additionally, potential research methodologies, such as focusing on intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions, adjusting aggregates morphology, and regulating the constituents, along with directions, and implications are offered for future studies.

Beyond serving as a supportive matrix, lignocellulose can be tailored to optimize the microstructure of the composites, adapting them for diverse applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the fundamental principles and recent advancements in lignocellulose&#8208;mediated LM composites, highlighting the advantages of lignocellulose in composite fabrication, including facile synthesis, versatile interactions, and inherent functionalities. Key modulation strategies for LMs and innovative synthesis methods for functionalized lignocellulose composites are discussed. Furthermore, the roles and structure&#8211;performance relationships of these composites in electromagnetic shielding, flexible sensors, and energy storage devices are systematically summarized. Finally, the obstacles and prospective advancements pertaining to lignocellulose&#8208;mediated LM composites are thoroughly scrutinized and deliberated upon. This review is expected to provide basic guidance for researchers to boost the popularity of LMs in diverse applications and provide useful references for design strategies of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LMs.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC-Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1-Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper-layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combined Photopolymerization and Localized Photochromism by Aza&#8208;Diarylethene and Hemiindigo Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four levels of advanced photoresponsive materials are reported using aza&#8208;diarylethene and hemiindigo photoswitches. Starting from blending photochromes with polymers, a novel photopolymerization by aza&#8208;diarylethene is demonstrated next, which can be combined with subsequent photochrome addition. Finally, synergistic and simultaneous photopolymerization and photochrome localization in a multi&#8208;photoresponsive materials application is realized.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches produce light&#8208;controlled changes at the nanometer scale and can therefore be used to alter the states and behavior of materials in a truly bottom&#8208;up fashion. Here an escalating photonic complexity of material property control with light is shown using a recently developed aza&#8208;diarylethene in combination with hemiindigo (HI) photoswitches. First, aza&#8208;diarylethene can be used as a photoswitch in polystyrene (PS) to reversibly inscribe relief&#8208;type 3D structures into PS. Second, aza&#8208;diarylethene can further be used as a photoinitiator for light&#8208;induced polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA), demonstrating for the first time light&#8208;controlled chemical reactivity control with its zwitterionic switching state. Third, aza&#8208;diarylethene and HIs are implemented into aza&#8208;diarylethene polymerized MA, generating photochromic polymers. At the fourth level, a binary mixture allows to synergize aza&#8208;diarylethene&#8208;induced photopolymerization with localized photochromism changes of the simultaneously entrapped functional HI. With such multilevel light response, the utility of this particular photoswitch combination for applications in advanced photonic materials is demonstrated.

         <title>Scalable Multistep Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Multifunctional and Robust Reentrant Microcavity Surfaces via a Wetting&#8208;Induced Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#160;printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting&#8208;induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray&#8208;coated ultraviolet&#8208;curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti&#8208;icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

         <title>Assessing the Effect of a Schwarz P Surface on the Oxygen Electroreduction Performance of Porous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous catalyst with a Schwarz P surface and dense single&#8208;atom sites is prepared. The 3D continuous mesochannels enable smooth mass transfer into the deep internal of the catalyst and high accessibility of catalytic sites, while the Schwarz P surface reduces the reaction energy barrier, improving the intrinsic catalytic activity.









Abstract
The surface curvature of catalysts has a decisive impact on their catalytic performance. However, the influence of a negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature surface on the catalytic performance of porous catalysts has remained unexplored due to the lack of suitable samples. Bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous structures can serve as ideal models, but they are known as &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; due to their highly difficult preparation. Here, using metal&#8211;organic frameworks as the precursor and polymer cubosomes as the template, a bicontinuous mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (named bmFeSAC) with a Schwarz P surface is synthesized. The bmFeSAC catalyst has a large specific surface area of 916&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 and uniformly distributed Fe&#8208;N4 active sites with a 1.80&#160;wt.% Fe content. The continuous channels enabled high utilization efficiency of the Fe&#8208;N4 catalytic sites, while the negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature surface enabled low reaction energy barrier. As an electrocatalyst of the oxygen reduction reaction, bmFeSAC delivered a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.931&#160;V versus. RHE in alkaline electrolyte, reaching the leading level among those of the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the bmFeSAC&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries exhibited excellent performance, demonstrating the potential application of bmFeSAC. This study revealed that a bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous structure can improve catalytic activity by increasing the utilization ratio of catalytic sites and, more importantly, by regulating the electronic structure of catalyst surfaces through the negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature.

A type of mos&#8208;MOFs are successfully synthesized with the non&#8208;crystallographic (3,6)&#8208;connected molybdenum disulfide (mos) network featuring abundant intralayer voids, displaying impressive apparent BET surface areas. Highly porous and stable Cr&#8208;mos&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 demonstrates a high water vapor adsorption capacity. This approach can be extended to the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation highly porous 2D&#8208;MOFs, or even 2D crystalline framework materials.



Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;MOFs) are an important class of functional porous materials. However, the low porosity and surface area of 2D&#8208;MOFs have greatly limited their functionalities and applications. Herein, the rational synthesis of a class of mos&#8208;MOFs with molybdenum disulfide (mos) net based on the assembly of trinuclear metal clusters and 3&#8208;connected tripodal organic ligands is reported. The non&#8208;crystallographic (3,6)&#8208;connected mos net, different from the 3&#8208;connected hcb net of graphene, offers abundant intralayer voids courtesy of the split of one node into two. Indeed, mos&#8208;MOFs exhibit high apparent Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface areas, significantly superior to those of other 2D&#8208;MOF analogs. Markedly, hydrolytically stable Cr&#8208;mos&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 displays an impressive water vapor uptake of 0.75 g g&#8722;1 at 298 K and P/P0 = 0.9, among the highest in 2D&#8208;MOFs. The combined water adsorption and X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveal the water adsorption mechanisms, suggesting the importance of intralayer porosities of mos&#8208;MOFs for high&#8208;performance water capture. This study paves the way for a reliable approach to synthesizing 2D&#8208;MOFs with high porosity and surface areas for diverse applications.

         <title>Vertical Graphene&#8208;Based Multiparametric Sensing Array for Integration of Smart Catheter to Electrochemically Monitor Peritoneal Dialysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) developed for smart catheter integration to electrochemically monitor peritoneal dialysis. Vertical graphene electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as a core module to develop a miniatured sensing array&#160;with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enabled sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components, realizing in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous biochemical information collection during peritoneal dialysis.








Abstract
Renal failure is typical chronic kidney disease that required peritoneal dialysis as the primary treatment, but current catheter devices lack functionality to monitor changes in chemical analytes during peritoneal dialysis. Fabrication of miniatured sensing modules with good electrochemical performance in tiny catheter devices is the key to realize the smart monitoring of peritoneal dialysis. In this work, a vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) is developed to continuously measure fluctuations of various analyte concentrations for peritoneal dialysis monitoring. Vertical graphene (VG) electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as the core module in VG&#8208;MSA, allowing the development of miniatured sensing modules with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enables sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components like metabolites (reactive oxygen species, uric acid, and glucose) and ions (K+, Ca2+, and H+). The VG&#8208;MSA is demonstrated to effectively detect biochemical signals in peritoneal dialysate in vivo on rat models. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter can be inserted into abdominal cavity, allowing full contact with dialysate for in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous collection of biochemical information during peritoneal dialysis. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter device offers a valuable tool for monitoring dialysis quality and facilitating treatment adjustments, potentially as a promising platform for high&#8208;quality therapy of renal failure.

         <title>Optimizing Si&#9472;O Conjugation to Enhance Interfacial Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic molecular bond design has led to the identification of siloxanes as novel low&#8208;temperature solvents for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens Li+&#8208;solvent interactions.








Abstract
With the growing demand for high&#8208;voltage and wide&#8208;temperature range applications of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), the requirements for electrolytes have become increasingly stringent. While fluorination engineering has enhanced the performance of traditional solvent systems, it has also raised concerns regarding cost, environmental hazards, and low reduction stability. Through strategic molecular bond design, a novel class of low&#8208;temperature (LT) solvents&#8212;siloxanes&#8212;is identified, meeting the demands of LT and high&#8208;voltage applications in LIBs. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens the Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. By modulating the number of Si&#9472;O conjugated bonds, the type of anion clusters in the solvation structure can be controlled, ultimately leading to the formation of a LiF and Si&#9472;O&#8208;rich interfacial layer and facilitating rapid Li+ conduction. Consequently, the graphite||NCM811 pouch cell (2.3 Ah, 4.45 V) with a siloxane&#8208;based electrolyte retains 75.1% of room temperature capacity (RTC) at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The rapid interface kinetics allow a superior reversible charging capacity retention of 67.6% at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with good cycle stability at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This study provides new insights into solvent design to fortify LIB performance in harsh conditions.

         <title>Band Alignment Semimetal Heterojunction&#8208;Based Ultrabroadband Photodetector for Noncontact Gesture Interaction with Low Latency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetector, designed with band alignment theory, has been developed which exhibits exceptional sensitivity, an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range, and swift response times. Integrating this detector with a sophisticated spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling system, the Infrared Gesture Recognition and Interaction System (IGRIS) is achieved with ultra&#8208;low latency, minimal energy consumption (zero bias), and adaptability to diverse scenarios.








Abstract
Non&#8208;contact gesture recognition and interaction (NGRI) revolutionizes the natural user interface, fundamentally transforming human interactions with daily&#8208;use technology. Conventional NGRI systems frequently encounter obstacles such as pronounced latency and environmental disturbances, including humidity or lighting conditions, resulting in compromised system fluidity and robustness. This study highlights the utilization of silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetectors for precise gesture recognition and seamless human&#8208;machine interaction. Through the application of band alignment theory and sophisticated TCAD simulation, heterojunction barriers are successfully optimized by fine&#8208;tuning parameters including Si doping concentration and semimetal thickness. By strategically aligning vertical material growth and implementing vertical heterojunction configuration, a room temperature detector with exceptional sensitivity (specific detectivity (D*): &#8776;1011 Jones), ultra&#8208;broad spectral range (405&#8211;10600 nm), and rapid response time (&#8776; &#181;s) is achieved. Harnessing its distinguished speed and sensitivity in detecting human infrared radiation, in conjunction with an advanced spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling processing design, a NGRI system with low latency, high precision, minimal energy consumption, and versatility across diverse scenarios has been developed. The results pave the way for non&#8208;contact sensor design and may further enhance the practicality and user experience of non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Multiplexed Plasmonic Color Encryption of Microgel Architectures via Programmable Dithering&#8208;Mask Flow Microlithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a scalable method for creating microgel structures with multiplexed hidden plasmonic colors via in situ grown AgNPs in porosity modulated hydrogel network. Utilizing advanced maskless flow microlithography and dithering&#8208;mask techniques, high&#8208;resolution and large&#8208;scale production of multiplexed plasmonic color encrypted microstructures are achieved and realized. A deep&#8208;learning analysis validates the fidelity between encrypted and decrypted colors, featuring significant potential for secure data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their unique plasmonic colors and interaction with light, making them ideal for color printing and data encoding. Traditional methods like electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling, however, suffer from low throughput and high costs. In this paper, a scalable and cost&#8208;efficient method is introduced for producing multiplexed plasmonic colors by in situ photoreducing AgNPs within microgel architectures with controlled porosity. Utilizing a digital micro&#8208;mirror device (DMD)&#8208;based flow microlithography system combined with a programmable dithering&#8208;mask technique, the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of shape or barcoded microparticles is facilitated, along with large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution images embedded with hidden multiplexed plasmonic colors. This approach allows for a hidden multiplexed plasmonic color code library, significant enhancing the encoding capacity of barcode microparticles from 33 to 303 (a 1000&#8208;fold increase). Additionally, quantitative agreement is achieved between chemically encrypted and optically decrypted plasmonic colors using a deep learning classifier. Moreover, the method also supports the production of large scale (&gt;5.6 &#215; 5.6&#160;cm2), high&#8208;resolution (&gt;300 dpi) microgel arrays encrypted with multiple plasmonic colors in under 30&#160;min. The multiplexed plasmonic coloration strategy in microgel architectures paves a new way for hidden data storage, secure optical labeling, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.

     alt="High-Throughput Multiplexed Plasmonic Color Encryption of Microgel Architectures via Programmable Dithering-Mask Flow Microlithography"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a scalable method for creating microgel structures with multiplexed hidden plasmonic colors via in situ grown AgNPs in porosity modulated hydrogel network. Utilizing advanced maskless flow microlithography and dithering-mask techniques, high-resolution and large-scale production of multiplexed plasmonic color encrypted microstructures are achieved and realized. A deep-learning analysis validates the fidelity between encrypted and decrypted colors, featuring significant potential for secure data storage and anti-counterfeiting.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their unique plasmonic colors and interaction with light, making them ideal for color printing and data encoding. Traditional methods like electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling, however, suffer from low throughput and high costs. In this paper, a scalable and cost-efficient method is introduced for producing multiplexed plasmonic colors by in situ photoreducing AgNPs within microgel architectures with controlled porosity. Utilizing a digital micro-mirror device (DMD)-based flow microlithography system combined with a programmable dithering-mask technique, the high-throughput synthesis of shape or barcoded microparticles is facilitated, along with large-scale, high-resolution images embedded with hidden multiplexed plasmonic colors. This approach allows for a hidden multiplexed plasmonic color code library, significant enhancing the encoding capacity of barcode microparticles from 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 30&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (a 1000-fold increase). Additionally, quantitative agreement is achieved between chemically encrypted and optically decrypted plasmonic colors using a deep learning classifier. Moreover, the method also supports the production of large scale (&amp;gt;5.6 &#215; 5.6&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), high-resolution (&amp;gt;300 dpi) microgel arrays encrypted with multiple plasmonic colors in under 30&#160;min. The multiplexed plasmonic coloration strategy in microgel architectures paves a new way for hidden data storage, secure optical labeling, and anti-counterfeiting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long&#8208;Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light&#8208;curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long&#8208;term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light&#8208;curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long&#8208;lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.









Abstract
Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long&#8208;lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%. This novel design concept offers a promising approach for developing advanced medical dressings for periodontitis, providing sustained therapeutic benefits.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Welding Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced self&#8208;welding method is used to repair defects and cracks in the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long&#8208;term mechanical stability of flexible perovskite cells and modules. The flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieves a record PCE of 21.65% and retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs) are highly promising for both stationary and mobile applications because of their advantageous features, including mechanical flexibility, their lightweight and thin nature, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a number of drawbacks, such as mechanical instability, make their practical application difficult. Here, self&#8208;welding dynamic diselenide that is triggered by visible light into the structure of F&#8208;PSCs to improve their long&#8208;term stability by repairing cracks and defects in the absorber layer is incorporated. The diselenide confers the flexibility and self&#8208;welding properties to the Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9PbI3 perovskite layer, enabling optimized F&#8208;PSC devices to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% while retaining ca. 92% of their initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm. The corresponding flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieved a record PCE of 21.65%.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast, Unidirectional Water Absorption on Wood Ear</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption is observed on the abaxial surface of wood ear, featuring dense micro&#8208;sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;pores. The synergistic lateral and vertical wicking reduces droplet absorption time by two orders of magnitude compared to the un&#8208;hairy porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). This unique absorption mechanism holds significant potential for liquid manipulation in porous media.








Abstract
Materials exhibiting rapid, unidirectional liquid absorption are desirable for comfort textiles and wound dressings. Implementing chemical or structural gradient along the vertical axis of substrates is an effective way to achieve such properties. Liquid's lateral spreading across the substrate affects area occurring vertical imbibition. However, the influence of lateral spreading on liquid's overall absorption remains unexplored. Findings on ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption on the abhymenium of wood ear fungi are presented, featuring dense micro&#8208;sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing smaller micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;pores. These hairs facilitate lateral spreading, and the gradient&#8208;sized structures from the surface hairs to the internal pores enhance capillary force, promoting efficient vertical imbibition. The synergistic wicking mechanism in both directions shortens absorption time of a 1&#8208;&#181;L droplet by two orders of magnitude compared to a solely porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). An artificial micro&#8208;pillar array on a porous substrate also exhibits ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption. This study advances the understanding of liquid dynamics in porous media and provides a blueprint for engineering materials with superior liquid management.

Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy&#8208;saving solution for anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de&#8208;icing capabilities. However, a significant challenge in their practical application is the mechanical interlocking of micro&#8208;nanostructures with ice formed from condensed water vapor, leading to meltwater retention and compromised functionality post&#8208;de&#8208;icing. Here, a robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures are demonstrated through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of &#8776; 1250 s, photothermal de&#8208;icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165&#176;, and sliding angle of 0.2&#176;. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93&#160;MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro&#8208;nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non&#8208;wetted after photo&#8208;/electrothermal de&#8208;icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing. This exceptional performance is attributed to the designed phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures that liquefy during de&#8208;icing, significantly reducing interactions with water molecules, as quantitatively validated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new perspectives and methodologies for designing and creating innovative, high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surfaces.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Oriented and Deformation&#8208;Constrained Dual&#8208;topology Metamaterial with High&#8208;Stress Uniformity and Extraordinary Plastic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TCPL based on a multidimensional performance expansion strategy has performance indexes that are much higher than those of existing multicellular materials. By incorporating a deformation constraint strategy into TCPL, ETCPL has high&#8208;stress uniformity and extraordinary plastic properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. Besides, the strength&#8208;density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed predictions of Gibson&#8211;Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum.








Abstract
The study of classical mechanical metamaterials has overwhelmingly remained at the elastic stage, while the increase in extreme speeds of vehicles and aircraft has created an urgent need and demanding requirements for excellent plasticity performance. Although some plastically deformable metamaterials exist, high initial peak stresses, short plastic strokes, and low plastic stresses limit their applications considerably. Here, an ideal malleable large&#8208;deformation metamaterial featuring high&#8208;stress levels and stability is reported. A performance&#8208;oriented multidimensional performance expansion strategy is adopted to obtain the bionic triangular corrugation&#8208;based plate lattice (TCPL) metamaterial. Then, the deformation constraint strategy that TCPL is innovatively used as the main topology with lateral expansion and buckling inhibited by the inserted enhancing topology is proposed, thus obtaining the built&#8208;in dual&#8208;topology enhanced TCPL (ETCPL). The ETCPL is again substantially strengthened in stress uniformity with almost no gradient and mechanical properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. They are much more robust than typical multicellular materials, with the largest performance enhancement reaching 18 667.19%. In addition, the strength&#8208;density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed the predictions of Gibson&#8211;Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum. The unprecedented performance confirms that multidimensional performance expansion strategy and deformation constraint strategy have created new design guidelines for ideal high&#8208;performance plastic metamaterials.

         <title>An Oral PROTAC Targeting HPK1 Degradation Potentiates Anti&#8208;Solid Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oral PROTAC is developed to potentiate the immune response by targeting the degradation of HPK1 in T cells. Conveniently modifiable in dose and duration of administration, the oral PROTAC provides a promising tool for CAR&#8208;T cell&#8208; and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody&#8208;mediated immunotherapy for treating cancers such as cervical and colon cancers.








Abstract
Hematopoietic progenitor pinase1 (HPK1) knockout has been identified as an efficient route to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Here, this work develops an oral proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) targeting HPK1 to efficiently and selectively degrade HPK1 to augment immunotherapeutic outcomes. In a postoperative tumor model of human cervical cancer in NSG mice, the orally&#8208;administrated PROTAC can reach tumors, down&#8208;regulate HPK1 levels in locally&#8208;administrated CAR&#8208;T cells, and promote their efficiency in inhibiting solid tumor recurrence, achieving 50% partial response (PR) and 50% complete response (CR). In addition, oral administration of PROTAC can amplify the suppression capability of the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody on the growth of CT26 solid tumors in BALB/c mice by promoting the infiltration of CD45&#8208;positive immune cells from 0.7% to 1.5% and CD3&#8208;positive T cells from 0.2% to 0.5% within the tumors.

         <title>Orientation&#8208;Selective Memory Switching in Quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 Neuromorphic Device for Omnibearing Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the directional formation of conductive filaments, quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 memristor demonstrates excellent resistive switching behavior with small operating voltages. Anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to the high orientation selectivity in conductance update, thus contributing to the hardware implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for intelligent driving application with a high accuracy of 95.9%.








Abstract
Intelligent neuromorphic hardware holds considerable promise in addressing the growing demand for massive real&#8208;time data processing in edge computing. Resistive switching materials with intrinsic anisotropy and a compact design of non&#8208;volatile memory devices with the capability of handling spatiotemporally reconstructed data is crucial to perform sophisticated tasks in complex application scenarios. In this study, an anisotropic resistive switching cell with a planar configuration based on lithiated NbSe3 nanosheets is demonstrated. Benefitting from the highly aligned diffusive channel associated with a quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals structure, the memristor patterned along NbSe3 atomic chains presents robust memory switching behavior with superior stability, particularly the low set/reset voltages (0.4&#160;V/&#8722;0.36&#160;V) and extremely small standard deviation (0.041&#160;V/0.051&#160;V), among the best compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. More importantly, unlike traditional resistive switching materials, anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to a high orientation selectivity in the conductance update. Custom&#8208;designed neuromorphic hardware contributes to the implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for automatic pilot applications, yielding a high accuracy of 95.9% considering variations. This article presents a new strategy based on NbSe3 crystals to develop a neuromorphic computing system with intelligent application scenarios.

         <title>Edge Electron Effect Induced High&#8208;Entropy SEI for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific facet boundary and electron&#8208;donating property of flower edges zinc&#8208;modified aluminum substrate (E&#8208;Zn@Al) enhances anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane and accelerates anion/solvent decomposition. This process results in a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, and ensures high&#8208;density sodium nucleation and pyknotic growth. Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability under ultrahigh cathode loading.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries represent great promising as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and resource&#8208;rich electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the savage growth of sodium metal and continuous consumption hinder its stable capacity output. Herein, ordered flower&#8208;edges of zinc on Al substrate can induce high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to adjust sodium uniform deposition and extremely reduce electrolyte consumption with ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (97.05%) for prolong batteries cycling life. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the electron&#8208;donating property and exposed edge sites between (100) and (101) facets in zinc flower enhance anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane accelerating its interface decomposition. Additionally, the ordered zinc edges serve as homogeneous&#8208;nucleating template, leading to thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer (18 nm, ZnF2, NaZn13, NaF, and Na2CO3) with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, so that fast and high&#8208;flux Na ions transport field, thereby reducing the critical nucleation barrier and promoting sodium high density nucleation (7.36 &#215; 1013 N cm&#8722;2) and pyknotic growth (3 mAh cm&#8722;2, 22&#160;&#181;m). The assembled anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability (86%, 90 cycles) under ultrahigh cathode loading (32 mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the anode&#8208;less single&#8208;layer pouch batteries exhibit a durable capacity retention of 99% after 600 cycles.

         <title>Cooling&#8208;Induced Order&#8211;Disorder Phase Transition in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a temperature&#8208;driven order&#8211;disorder phase transition occurring in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal the loss of crystallinity of superlattices upon cooling and identify ligands solidification as the main driving force for this transition. Surface ligand engineering mitigates the structural degradation and results in strong exciton migration within the superlattice at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystal superlattices are being actively studied after reports have emerged on collective excitonic properties at cryogenic temperatures, where energetic disorder is minimized due to the frozen lattice vibrations. However, an important issue related to structural disorder of superlattices at low temperatures has received little attention to date. In this work, it is shown that CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices undergo a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition upon cooling to 90 K. The transition consists of the loss of structural coherence, that is, increased nanocrystal misalignment, and contraction of the superlattices, as revealed by temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and is ascribed to the solidification of ligands (on the basis of Raman spectroscopy). Introducing shorter amines on the nanocrystal surface allows to mitigate these changes, improve order, and shorten interparticle distance. It is demonstrated that the low temperature phase of the short ligand&#8208;capped nanocrystal superlattices is characterized by a strong exciton migration observable in the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the shrinkage of the inter&#8208;nanocrystal distance.

However, an important issue related to structural disorder of superlattices at low temperatures has received little attention to date. In this work, it is shown that CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystal superlattices undergo a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition upon cooling to 90 K. The transition consists of the loss of structural coherence, that is, increased nanocrystal misalignment, and contraction of the superlattices, as revealed by temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, and is ascribed to the solidification of ligands (on the basis of Raman spectroscopy). Introducing shorter amines on the nanocrystal surface allows to mitigate these changes, improve order, and shorten interparticle distance. It is demonstrated that the low temperature phase of the short ligand-capped nanocrystal superlattices is characterized by a strong exciton migration observable in the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the shrinkage of the inter-nanocrystal distance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Nanocoated Bacteria Generate an Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Tissue&#8208;Repair Effect in Impaired Gut and Extraintestinal Organs</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanocoating Clostridium butyricum with hyaluronic acid is reported to develop a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy, which can attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity, as well as alleviate interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.








Abstract
Diverse extraintestinal diseases are characterized by localized inflammatory responses and tissue damage, accompanied with intestinal inflammation and injury. Here, a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy is reported, which is the use of hyaluronic acid&#8208;nanocoated Clostridium butyricum to generate an anti&#8208;inflammatory tissue&#8208;repair effect in the impaired gut and extraintestinal organs. Nanocoated bacteria attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity by leveraging the immunosuppressive nature of hyaluronic acid and the butyrate&#8208;producing ability of Clostridium butyricum. Nanocoated bacteria also alleviate the interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. In murine models of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, oral delivery of nanocoated bacteria demonstrates the potency to restore renal function and eliminate renal fibrosis. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.

         <title>Printed High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs for Advanced Non&#8208;Volatile Memristive Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;volatile, printed memristor utilizing a high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analog (HE&#8208;PBA) sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes is reported, and the conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE&#8208;PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The Na+&#8208;modulated resistive switching strategy may provide valuable insights for addressing the high power consumption and volatile storage issues encountered in other insertion&#8208;type memristors.








Abstract
Non&#8208;volatile memristors dynamically switch between high (HRS) and low resistance states (LRS) in response to electrical stimuli, essential for electronic memories, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence. High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (HE&#8208;PBAs) are promising insertion&#8208;type battery materials due to their diverse composition, high structural integrity, and favorable ionic conductivity. This work proposes a non&#8208;volatile, bipolar memristor based on HE&#8208;PBA. The device, featuring an active layer of HE&#8208;PBA sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes, is fabricated by inkjet printing and microplotting. The conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE&#8208;PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The results indicate that the transition between HRS and LRS is driven by an insulating&#8208;metallic transition, triggered by extraction/insertion of highly mobile Na+ ions upon application of an electric field. The memristor operates through a low&#8208;energy process akin to Na+ shuttling in Na&#8208;ion batteries rather than depending on formation/rupture of Ag filaments. Notably, it showcases promising characteristics, including non&#8208;volatility, self&#8208;compliance, and forming&#8208;free behavior, and further exhibits low operation voltage (VSET = &#8722;0.26 V, VRESET = 0.36 V), low power consumption (PSET = 26 &#181;W, PRESET = 8.0 &#181;W), and a high ROFF/RON ratio of 104. This underscores the potential of high&#8208;entropy insertion materials for developing printed memristors with distinct operation mechanisms.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regenerative biohybrid bioelectronics represent an emerging class of technology combining the therapeutic potential of implantable bioelectronic devices and cell transplantations. In this perspective the future of this class of technology is evaluated, outlining therapeutic targets and applications. It is finished by discussing the technology challenges that remain to be overcome to enable their clinical potential.








Abstract
Biohybrid regenerative bioelectronics are an emerging technology combining implantable devices with cell transplantation. Once implanted, biohybrid regenerative devices integrate with host tissue. The combination of transplant and device provides an avenue to both replace damaged or dysfunctional tissue, and monitor or control its function with high precision. While early challenges in the fusion of the biological and technological components limited development of biohybrid regenerative technologies, progress in the field has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of applications. In this perspective the great potential of this emerging technology for the delivery of therapy is discussed, including both recent research progress and potential new directions. Then the technology barriers are discussed that will need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of biohybrid regenerative devices.

         <title>Optimizing the Electrical Microenvironment Provided by 3D Micropillar Topography on a Piezoelectric BaTiO3 Substrate to Enhance Osseointegration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illustration of a biomimetic 3D spatial electrical microenvironment created by patterning of micropillar arrays on a piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) ceramic substrate to enhance bone defect repair. The micropillar arrays with a positive&#8208;charge distribution sustainably maintained a 3D spatial electric microenvironment, which facilitated rapid osseointegration and the formation of a mature bone structure.








Abstract
The electrical properties of bone implant scaffolds are a pivotal factor in regulating cellular behavior and promoting osteogenesis. The previous study shows that built&#8208;in electric fields established between electropositive nanofilms and electronegative bone defect walls are beneficial for promoting bone defect healing. Considering that the physiological electrical microenvironment is spatially distributed in 3D, it is imperative to establish a 3D spatial charged microenvironment on bone scaffolds to optimize the efficacy of osseointegration. Nevertheless, this still poses a formidable challenge. Here, a bone repair strategy that utilizes micro&#8208;scale 3D topography is developed on a piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) substrate to provide 3D spatial electrical stimulation. The BTO micropillar arrays, especially with a height of 50 &#181;m and positive&#8208;charge distribution (50 &#181;m positive), promote the spreading, cytoskeletal reorganization, focal adhesion maturation, and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). They enhanced the clustering of mechanosensing integrin &#945;5 in BMSCs. The biomimetic 3D spatial electrical microenvironment accelerated bone repair and osseointegration in a rat femoral diaphysis defect repair model. The study thus reveals that implants with a 3D spatial electrical microenvironment can significantly enhance osseointegration, thereby providing a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Multilevel Optical Storage, Dynamic Light Modulation, and Polarization Control in Filamented Memristor System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a multifunction metallic filamented memristor offering wavelength&#8208;dependent optical storage, light modulation, and polarization control. The optical readout of the structure's state provides more accurate information than electrical measurements, enabling the recovery of the complete record of applied voltages even in the presence of stochastic filament breaks. Spectroscopic ellipsometry gives real&#8208;time insights into cation dynamics and permittivity changes.








Abstract
The electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism is emerging as a promising approach for the development of optical memristors&#8212;nonvolatile memory systems proposed for use as artificial synapses in neuromorphic computing applications. ECM memristors offer exceptional operating dynamics and power efficiency compared to other systems, but challenges with reproducible cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle state switching and the absence of advanced optical functionalities hinder their integration into photonic systems. In this work, an ECM free&#8208;standing memristor structure is proposed, which simultaneously offers wavelength&#8208;dependent multilevel nonvolatile optical storage, volatile light modulation, and dynamic polarization control. It is demonstrated that in the presence of a resonance, the optical readout provides noise&#8208;free, robust, and significantly more accurate information about the memristor's state than electrical measurement. The use of light allows to gain insight into the intermediate electrical levels of the device as it transitions between high and low resistance states and to recover the complete record of applied voltages even when stochastic filament ruptures occur. Finally, the investigations show that spectroscopic ellipsometry provides real&#8208;time information on the dynamics of cation movement and the corresponding permittivity changes at the interfaces between the switching layer and the electrodes, thus becoming a complementary characterization method for ECM memristors alongside state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques.

     alt="Multilevel Optical Storage, Dynamic Light Modulation, and Polarization Control in Filamented Memristor System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study proposes a multifunction metallic filamented memristor offering wavelength-dependent optical storage, light modulation, and polarization control. The optical readout of the structure's state provides more accurate information than electrical measurements, enabling the recovery of the complete record of applied voltages even in the presence of stochastic filament breaks. Spectroscopic ellipsometry gives real-time insights into cation dynamics and permittivity changes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism is emerging as a promising approach for the development of optical memristors&#8212;nonvolatile memory systems proposed for use as artificial synapses in neuromorphic computing applications. ECM memristors offer exceptional operating dynamics and power efficiency compared to other systems, but challenges with reproducible cycle-to-cycle state switching and the absence of advanced optical functionalities hinder their integration into photonic systems. In this work, an ECM free-standing memristor structure is proposed, which simultaneously offers wavelength-dependent multilevel nonvolatile optical storage, volatile light modulation, and dynamic polarization control. It is demonstrated that in the presence of a resonance, the optical readout provides noise-free, robust, and significantly more accurate information about the memristor's state than electrical measurement. The use of light allows to gain insight into the intermediate electrical levels of the device as it transitions between high and low resistance states and to recover the complete record of applied voltages even when stochastic filament ruptures occur. Finally, the investigations show that spectroscopic ellipsometry provides real-time information on the dynamics of cation movement and the corresponding permittivity changes at the interfaces between the switching layer and the electrodes, thus becoming a complementary characterization method for ECM memristors alongside state-of-the-art techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Upgrading of Bio&#8208;Furans to Benzene, Toluene, and p&#8208;xylene by Pt1Sn1 Intermetallic Coupling Ordered Mesoporous SnO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pt1Sn1 intermetallic coupling ordered&#8208;mesoporous SnO2 catalyst is reasonably designed to realize the efficient tandem upgrading of furan, furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to benzene, toluene and p&#8208;xylene, respectively, representing a new tandem catalytic system to realize the high&#8208;yield BTpX productions from the corresponding bio&#8208;furans and biofeedstock acrylic acid.








Abstract
Benzene, toluene, and p&#8208;xylene (BTpX) are among the most important commodity chemicals, but their productions still heavily rely on fossil resources and thus pose serious environmental burdens and energy crisis. Herein, the tandem upgrading of bio&#8208;furans is reported to high&#8208;yield BTpX by rationally constructing a versatile Pt1Sn1 intermetallic coupling ordered&#8208;mesoporous SnO2 (OM&#8208;SnO2) catalyst. It is shown that with increasing reduction temperature from 200 to 350&#160;&#176;C, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are first formed on OM&#8208;SnO2, then converted to Pt3Sn1 intermetallic nanoparticles (iNPs), and finally to Pt1Sn1 iNPs with a gradually&#8208;thickened SnO2 overlayer. Impressively, the Pt1Sn1 iNPs and defect&#8208;rich OM&#8208;SnO2 in the optimized Pt@OM&#8208;SnO2 can serve as the highly&#8208;active species for the hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and the aromatization of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran with acrylic acid to p&#8208;xylene, affording the highest yields of 99.1% and 96.1%, respectively. More importantly, it can perfectly realize the tandem upgrading of furan, furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to benzene, toluene and p&#8208;xylene with high yields of 94.6%, 94.2% and 95.2%, respectively, representing a new tandem catalytic system to realize the high&#8208;yield BTpX productions from their corresponding bio&#8208;furans. This catalyst also shows good recyclability and excellent scalability, which together with its superior activity/selectivity suggest a high potential for sustainable BTpX productions.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metallization of Plasmonic Semiconductor Surface for Selectively Enhancing IR&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer metallization strategy is proposed and representatively implemented by grafting Sn2+ ions onto exposed O atoms on the surface of a plasmonic W18O49 nanowire array (NWA). This strategy can enhance both plasmonic absorption and CO2 adsorption, therefore resulting in over 98% selective infrared (IR)&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CH4 with a &#8776;9.0&#8208;fold higher activity compared to bare W18O49 NWA.








Abstract
Efficient harvesting and utilization of abundant infrared (IR) photons from sunlight is crucial for the industrial application of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Plasmonic semiconductors have significant potential in absorbing low&#8208;energy IR photons to generate energetic hot electrons. However, modulating these hot electrons to selectively enhance the activity of CO2 reduction into CH4 remains a challenge. Herein, the study proposes a single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer (SAL) metallization strategy to enhance the generation of IR&#8208;driven hot electrons and facilitate their transfer from plasmonic semiconductors to CO2 for producing CH4. This strategy is demonstrated using a paradigmatic W18O49@W&#8208;Sn nanowire array (NWA), where Sn2+ ions are grafted onto exposed O atoms on the surface of plasmonic W18O49 to form a surface W&#8208;Sn SAL. The incorporation of Sn single atoms enhances plasmonic absorption in IR light for W18O49 NWA. The W&#8208;Sn SAL not only promotes CO2 adsorption and reduces its reaction activation energy barrier but also shifts the endoergic CO&#8208;protonation process toward an exoergic reaction pathway. Thus, the W18O49@W&#8208;Sn NWA exhibits &gt;98% selectivity for IR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CH4 with an activity over 9.0 times higher than that of bare W18O49 NWA. This SAL metallization strategy can also be applied to other plasmonic semiconductors for selectively enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction reactions.

Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of single&#8208;layer graphene and 1&#160;nm thick molecular carbon nanomembrane (CNM) are employed for detection of biomarkers in clinical samples.

Abstract
Due to their ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, solution&#8208;gated graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (SG&#8208;GFET) have been proposed for applications in bio&#8208;sensing. However, challenges regarding the functionalization of GFETs have prevented their applications in clinical diagnostics so far. Here GFET sensors based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of single&#8208;layer graphene layered with a molecular &#8776;1&#160;nm thick carbon nanomembrane (CNM) are presented. The CNM acts as an ultrathin molecular interposer between the graphene channel and the analyte and allows bio&#8208;functionalization without impairing the graphene properties including its charge carrier mobility. To achieve specificity and reliability in the detection of biomarkers in real patient samples, the functionalization incorporates biostable aptamers in the non&#8208;natural l&#8208;configuration and hydrophilic polyethylene glycol for avoiding non&#8208;specific adsorption. A rapid (&#8776;5&#160;min) detection of the clinically relevant inflammatory mediator CXCL8/IL&#8208;8 within the concentration range of 0.5 &#8211; 500 pM (5 &#8211; 5000 pg&#160;ml&#8722;1) is demonstrated in nasal swab samples collected from patients with respiratory tract infections. This detection range may aid in diagnostics of early&#8208;stage infectious diseases making the reported approach promising for the development of future medical tools.

         <title>Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn2+ transport channels and facilitates Zn2+ desolvation, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ&#8208;Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn2+ flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn2+ desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H2O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn2+ transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ&#8208;Zn||StZ&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&#8722;2. Notably, StZ&#8208;Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.

     alt="Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra-Stable Zn Metal Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion-bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels and facilitates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation, enabling dendrite-free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion-bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ-Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and enabling dendrite-free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ-Zn||StZ-Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, StZ-Zn||NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the exciton dynamics in layered halide perovskitelight&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). It opens with a summary of the structural and photophysical aspects, followed by an exploration of controlling dimensionality and cascade exciton transfer in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs. The review also addresses complex dynamics, such as multiexciton processes and triplet exciton dynamics, which are often overlooked.








Abstract
Layered halide perovskites have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties and great promises in light&#8208;emitting applications. Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) requires a deep understanding of exciton dynamics in these materials. This review begins with a fundamental overview of the structural and photophysical properties of layered halide perovskites, then delves into the importance of dimensionality control and cascade energy transfer in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs. In the second half of the review, more complex exciton dynamics, such as multiexciton processes and triplet exciton dynamics, from the perspective of LEDs are explored. Through this comprehensive review, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical aspects of exciton dynamics in layered halide perovskites and their impacts on future research and technological advancements for layered halide PeLEDs is provided.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Porous Scaffolds to Suppress Osteosarcoma and Promote Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows the schematic diagram showing the potential application of 3D&#8208;printed Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffold in osteosarcoma postoperative therapy. The L&#8208;PBF fabricated Zn&#8208;0.8Li Gyroid scaffold with favorable mechanical properties can optimally balance the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+, inhibiting the malignant biological behavior of tumor and promoting osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Postoperative therapies for osteosarcoma present substantial challenges due to tumor recurrence and extensive bone defects. To tackle these challenges, laser powder bed fusion is utilized to fabricate biodegradable Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffolds that supress tumors and promote osteogenesis. After the structure design and composition selection, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold with Gyroid unit optimally balances the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+ during degradation, resulting in favorable antitumor and osteogenic effects. In vitro, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold significantly inhibits osteosarcoma progression by suppressing tumor cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, alleviating migration, and simultaneously promotes osteogenic differentiation through the enhanced expression of osteogenic markers. In vivo, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold inhibits the malignant osteosarcoma behavior and facilitates bone regeneration in areas with bone defects. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals that the simultaneous release of Zn2+ and Li+ from the biodegradable Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold contributes to anti&#8208;osteosarcoma activity by downregulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold fabricated using laser powder bed fusion with enhanced antitumor and osteogenic properties is a promising alternative for the postoperative management of osteosarcoma.

         <title>Harnessing Extrinsic Dissipation to Enhance the Toughness of Composites and Composite Joints: A State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Review of Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how toughness of laminated structures can be manipulated by engineering heterogeneity and microstructure of interfaces, bond lines and substrates. These techniques favor dissipation&#8208;enhancing mechanisms such as fragmentation, long&#8208;range bridging and can only be described by innovative modeling&#160;approaches.








Abstract
Interfaces play a critical role in modern structures, where integrating multiple materials and components is essential to achieve specific functions. Enhancing the mechanical performance of these interfaces, particularly their resistance to delamination, is essential to enable extremely lightweight designs and improve energy efficiency. Improving toughness (or increasing energy dissipation during delamination) has traditionally involved modifying materials to navigate the well&#8208;known strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off. However, a more effective strategy involves promoting non&#8208;local or extrinsic energy dissipation. This approach encompasses complex degradation phenomena that extend beyond the crack tip, such as long&#8208;range bridging, crack fragmentation, and ligament&#160;formation. This work explores this innovative strategy within the arena of laminated structures, with a particular focus on fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers. This review highlights the substantial potential for improvement by presenting various strategies, from basic principles to proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications. This approach represents a significant design direction for integrating materials and structures, especially relevant in the emerging era of additive manufacturing. However, it also comes with new challenges in predictive modeling of such mechanisms at the structural scale, and here the latest development in this direction is highlighted. Through this perspective, greater durability and performance in advanced structural applications can be&#160;achieved.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Local Chemical Enhancement and Gating of Organic Coordinated Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft&#8208;robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Programmability of 3D Chiral Color Units Driven by Ink Spontaneous Diffusion toward Customized Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved 3D chiral color modulation method is proposed, utilizing diffusion&#8208;driven asymmetric lattice deformation in dual&#8208;chiral polymer&#8208;templated blue phases. Custom&#8208;printed colorful patterns, optimized by machine learning, display programmable multidimensional encrypted information, including evolving colors, chiral modes, surface bulges, and ink dispersion. This approach offers new insights into manipulating 3D chiral structures for information security and visual sensing.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) have exhibited promising applications in 3D flexible displays due to their molecular&#8208;level self&#8208;assembled chiral structures, fast response, and tunable polarized colors. However, there remain challenges for spatiotemporal programming of 3D chiral color units for BPLC dynamic patterning. Herein, the programmable temporal evolution of micrometer&#8208;scale color units and spatial configuration switch of chiral modes are achieved by spontaneous ink diffusion&#8208;driven asymmetric lattice deformation in dual&#8208;chiral polymer&#8208;templated blue phases. Custom&#8208;printed colorful patterns are designed by machine learning&#8208;assisted parameter optimization, which displays programmable multidimensional encrypted information that incorporates temporal evolving colors (wavelength), spatial distribution (depth), chiral modes (L/R). The quantitative relationship between ink diffusion kinetics and blue&#8208;phase dynamic 3D structural optics is established by in situ characterization, finite element analysis, and mathematical geometry modeling. This work provides insights into the microgeometric manipulation of 3D chiral color of BPLCs in the application of information security and self&#8208;adaptive indicators.

         <title>Iridium Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Ensembles Stabilized on Mn&#8208;Substituted Spinel Oxide for Durable Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited stability of single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a long&#8208;standing issue. Herein, an innovative strategy is presented to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles on Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4, which effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, demonstrating excellent activity and stability for acidic OER.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production via acidic water electrolyzers. However, the limited durability of most single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides under harsh acidic OER conditions, primarily attributed to excessive lattice oxygen participation resulting in metal&#8208;leaching and structural collapse, hinders their practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles (IrSAE) stabilized on the surface of Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4 (IrSAE&#8208;CMO), which exhibits excellent mass activity and significantly improved durability (degradation&#8208;rate: &#8776;2&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1), outperforming benchmark IrO2 (&#8776;44&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1) and conventional Irsingle&#8208;atoms on pristine&#8208;Co3O4 for acidic OER. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that Mn&#8208;substitution in the octahedral sites of Co3O4 substantially reduces the migration energy barrier for Irsingle&#8208;atoms on the CMO surface compared to pristine&#8208;Co3O4, facilitating the migration of Irsingle&#8208;atoms to form strongly correlated IrSAE during pyrolysis. Extensive ex situ characterization, operando X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies, pH&#8208;dependence activity tests, and theoretical calculations indicate that the rigid IrSAE with appropriate Ir&#8211;Ir distance stabilized on the CMO surface effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, thereby mitigating Ir&#8208;dissolution and structural collapse, boosting the stability in an acidic environment.

         <title>Robust Electric&#8208;Field Control of Colossal Exchange Bias in CrI3 Homotrilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust electric&#8208;field control of exchange bias (EB)&#160;effect and magnetism transition is realized in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer. The doping from the Y&#8208;doped HfO2 substrate alters the interlayer coupling of intrinsic CrI3 trilayer and further causes the EB effect. The gate voltage reverses the magnetization direction layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer in homotrilayer CrI3, leading to a colossal EB modulation of 0.48 T.








Abstract
Controlling exchange bias (EB) by electric fields is crucial for next&#8208;generation magnetic random access memories and spintronics with ultralow energy consumption and ultrahigh speed. Multiferroic heterostructures have been traditionally used to electrically control EB and interfacial ferromagnetism through weak/indirect coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric films. However, three major bottlenecks (lattice mismatch, interface defects, and weak/indirect coupling in multiferroic heterostructures) remain, resulting in only a few tens of milli&#8208;tesla EB field. Here, this study reports a robust electric&#8208;field control recipe to dynamically tailor the EB effect in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer on a ferroelectric Y&#8208;doped HfO2 (HYO) substrate, and demonstrate a colossal and tunable EB field (HE) from &#8722;0.15 to +0.33 T, giving rise to an EB modulation of 0.48 T. The charge doping due to ferroelectric HYO film divides a homo&#8208;configuration of CrI3 homotrilayer into one antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer CrI3 and one ferromagnetic (FM) monolayer CrI3, favoring direct exchange coupling. The synergies of charge doping and electric field induce a transition of magnetic orders from AFM to FM phase in bilayer CrI3, which is also supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, leading to the robust electric control of colossal EB effect. The results therefore open numerous opportunities for exploring 2D spintronics, memories, and braininspired in&#8208;memory computing.

Abstract
Bacterial&#8208;induced lower respiratory tract infections are a growing global health concern, exacerbated by the inefficacy of conventional antibiotics and delivery methods to effectively target the lower respiratory tract, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. To address this challenge, this work engineers PBP2a antibody&#8208;presenting membrane nanovesicles (AMVs) specifically designed to target the penicillin&#8208;binding protein variant on the surface of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Concurrently, this work develops pure ciprofloxacin nanoparticles (NanoCip) that, for the first time, exhibits exceptional self&#8208;generated sonodynamic properties, attributed to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, while maintaining their inherent pharmacological efficacy. These NanoCip particles are integrated with AMVs to create a novel biomimetic nanomedicine, AMV@NanoCip. This formulation demonstrated remarkable MRSA&#8208;targeting affinity in both in vitro and in vivo models, significantly enhancing antibacterial activity. Upon ultrasound stimulation, AMV@NanoCip achieves over 99.99% sterilization of MRSA in vitro, with a reduction exceeding 5.14 Log CFU. Prokaryotic transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the synergistic mechanisms by which AMV@NanoCip, coupled with ultrasound, disrupts the MRSA exoskeleton. In a MRSA&#8208;induced pneumonia animal model, AMV@NanoCip+US results in a substantial bacterial load reduction in the lungs (99.99%, 4.02 Log CFU). This sequential treatment strategy (adhesion&#8208;membrane disruption&#8208;synergistic therapy) offers significant promise as an innovative therapeutic approach for combating bacterial infections.

         <title>Mimicking Antiferroelectrics with Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferroelectrics are promising materials for applications in energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative&#8208;capacitance devices. This study demonstrates that antiferroelectric&#8208;like behavior can be electrostatically engineered in ferroelectric superlattices. An electric field induces a reversible transition from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric oxides are promising materials for applications in high&#8208;density energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative capacitance devices. However, the range of oxide antiferroelectrics available today is rather limited. In this work, it is demonstrated that antiferroelectric properties can be electrostatically engineered in artificially layered ferroelectric superlattices. Using a combination of synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, macroscopic electrical measurements, and lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy in parallel&#8208;plate capacitor geometry, a highly reversible field&#8208;induced transition is observed from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar to polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics, with corresponding polarization&#8208;voltage double hysteresis and comparable energy storage capacity. Furthermore, it is found that such superlattices exhibit large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dielectric responses without involving flux&#8208;closure domain dynamics. These results demonstrate that electrostatic and strain engineering in artificially layered materials offers a promising route for the creation of synthetic antiferroelectrics.

         <title>Ordered Transfer from 3D&#8208;Oriented MOF Superstructures to Polymeric Films: Microfabrication, Enhanced Chemical Stability, and Anisotropic Fluorescent Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films are used as templates for the fabrication of oriented porous polymer films and patterns. MOF films are prepared via heteroepitaxial growth; X&#8208;ray sensitivity is achieved using an azide&#8208;functionalized linker. X&#8208;ray irradiation degrades the MOF film in exposed regions; masked areas are cross&#8208;linked via azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Acidic treatment affords polymeric films and patterns with anisotropic fluorescent properties.








Abstract
Films and patterns of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) afford well&#8208;ordered pore structures extending across centimeter&#8208;scale areas. These macroscopic domains of aligned pores are pivotal to enhance diffusion along specific pathways and orient functional guests. The anisotropic properties emerging from this alignment are beneficial for applications in ion conductivity and photonics. However, the structure of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF films and patterns can rapidly degrade under humid and acidic conditions. Thus, more durable 3D&#8208;ordered porous systems are desired for practical applications. Here, oriented porous polymer films and patterns are prepared by using heteroepitaxially oriented N3&#8208;functionalized MOF films as precursor materials. The film fabrication protocol utilizes an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition on the Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO MOF. The micropatterning protocol exploits the X&#8208;ray sensitivity of azide groups in Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO, enabling selective degradation in the irradiated areas. The masked regions of the MOF film retain their N3&#8208;functionality, allowing for subsequent cross&#8208;linking through azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Subsequent acidic treatment removes the Cu ions from the MOF, yielding porous polymer micro&#8208;patterns. The polymer has high chemical stability and shows an anisotropic fluorescent response. The use of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF systems as precursors for the fabrication of oriented porous polymers will facilitate the progress of optical components for photonic applications.

         <title>Characterization of Microscopic Structures in Living Tumor by In Vivo Measurement of Magnetic Relaxation Time Distribution of Intratumor Magnetic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate world of tumor microstructures bears great significance in cancer diagnostics and therapy. This study delves into the magnetic relaxation response of magnetic nanoparticles within tumors, unraveling insights into cancer cell distribution, stromal components, and vascularization. Measuring magnetic relaxation time and analyzing tumor structures paves the way for noninvasive cancer diagnostics and therapeutics using magnetic nanoparticles.









Abstract
Tumor microscopic structure is crucial for determining properties such as cancer type, disease state (key for early diagnosis), and novel therapeutic strategies. Magnetic particle imaging is an early cancer diagnostic tool using magnetic nanoparticles as a tracer, which actualizes cancer theranostics in combination with hyperthermia treatment using the abilities of magnetic nanoparticles as a heat source. This study focuses on the microscopic structures associated with cancer cell distribution, the stromal compartment, and vascularization in different kinds of living tumors by analyzing the intratumor magnetic relaxation response of magnetic nanoparticles injected into the tumors. Furthermore, this study describes a sequential system for the measurement of magnetic relaxation time and analysis of the intratumor structure using nonbiological samples such as viscous fluids and solidified magnetic nanoparticles. Particularly, the fine discriminability achieved by reconstructing a distribution map representing the relationship between magnetic relaxation time and viscosity of medium is demonstrated, based on experimental data with a limited condition number. Observing tumor microscopic structure through the dynamic magnetization response of intratumor magnetic nanoparticles is a low&#8208;invasive tool for analyzing tumor tissue without dissection. It holds promise for the advancement of biomedical applications, such as early cancer theranostics, using magnetic nanoparticles.

         <title>In Vivo Optogenetics Based on Heavy Metal&#8208;Free Photon Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo, optogenetics using photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation is demonstrated. The modification of a thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer with a bromo group promotes intersystem crossing and enables high TTA&#8208;UC efficiency at weak excitation light intensities even without using heavy metals. Air&#8208;stable UC nanoparticles exhibiting red&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC induce EGFP expression in the mouse brain.








Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) from red or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to blue light is promising for in vivo optogenetics. However, the examples of in vivo optogenetics have been limited to lanthanide inorganic UC nanoparticles, and there have been no examples of optogenetics without using heavy metals. Here the first example of in vivo optogenetics using biocompatible heavy metal&#8208;free TTA&#8208;UC nanoemulsions is shown. A new organic TADF sensitizer, a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative modified with a bromo group, can promote intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state, significantly improving TTA&#8208;UC efficiency. The TTA&#8208;UC nanoparticles formed from biocompatible surfactants and methyl oleate acquire water dispersibility and remarkable oxygen tolerance. By combining with genome engineering technology using the blue light&#8208;responding photoactivatable Cre&#8208;recombinase (PA&#8208;Cre), TTA&#8208;UC nanoparticles promote Cre&#8208;reporter EGFP expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo.

     alt="In Vivo Optogenetics Based on Heavy Metal-Free Photon Upconversion Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vivo, optogenetics using photon upconversion (TTA-UC) based on triplet-triplet annihilation is demonstrated. The modification of a thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer with a bromo group promotes intersystem crossing and enables high TTA-UC efficiency at weak excitation light intensities even without using heavy metals. Air-stable UC nanoparticles exhibiting red-to-blue TTA-UC induce EGFP expression in the mouse brain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photon upconversion (UC) from red or near-infrared (NIR) light to blue light is promising for in vivo optogenetics. However, the examples of in vivo optogenetics have been limited to lanthanide inorganic UC nanoparticles, and there have been no examples of optogenetics without using heavy metals. Here the first example of in vivo optogenetics using biocompatible heavy metal-free TTA-UC nanoemulsions is shown. A new organic TADF sensitizer, a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative modified with a bromo group, can promote intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state, significantly improving TTA-UC efficiency. The TTA-UC nanoparticles formed from biocompatible surfactants and methyl oleate acquire water dispersibility and remarkable oxygen tolerance. By combining with genome engineering technology using the blue light-responding photoactivatable Cre-recombinase (PA-Cre), TTA-UC nanoparticles promote Cre-reporter EGFP expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. The results open new opportunities toward deep-tissue control of neural activities based on heavy metal-free fully organic UC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Biomaterial for the Treatment and Prevention of Central Line&#8208;Associated Bloodstream Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SteriGel is an injectable tissue adhesive hydrogel engineered to address central line&#8208;associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). With its combined antimicrobial and wound&#8208;healing capabilities, SteriGel shows great potential for preventing and treating CLABSI. The hydrogel can effectively infiltrate the skin incision site surrounding the catheter, quickly solidify upon injection, adhere to skin tissue, and endure external pressures, thus guaranteeing sustained antimicrobial and healing effects.








Abstract
Central venous catheters are among the most used medical devices in hospitals today. Despite advances in modern medicine, catheter infections remain prevalent, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here, SteriGel is reported, which is a multifunctional hydrogel engineered to prevent and treat central line&#8208;associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The mechanical properties of SteriGel are optimized to ensure appropriate gelation kinetics, bio&#8208;adhesiveness, stretchability, and recoverability to promote durability upon application and to provide persistent protection against infection. In vitro assays demonstrated that SteriGel exhibits long&#8208;term antimicrobial efficacy and has bactericidal effects against highly resistant patient&#8208;derived pathogens known to be frequently associated with CLABSI. SteriGel outperformed Biopatch, which is a clinically used device for CLABSI, in ex vivo cadaver studies that simulate clinical scenarios. Furthermore, SteriGel has biocompatible, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties in vitro and in a rat subcutaneous injection model, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in the prevention and treatment of CLABSI. SteriGel is a multifunctional adherent biomaterial with potent antimicrobial effects for sustained sterility while promoting healing of the catheter incision site to protect against infection.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Controlled Ferroelectricity and Emergent Multiferroicity in WSe2 Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twisted tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers stacked along with monolayer graphene exhibit noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. Also, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior.








Abstract
Recently, researchers have been investigating artificial ferroelectricity, which arises when inversion symmetry is broken in certain R&#8208;stacked, i.e., zero&#8208;degree twisted, van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. Here, the study reports the twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers. The findings show noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. This twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity serves as a spectroscopic tool for detecting transitions between commensurate and incommensurate moir&#233; patterns. At 5.5 K, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior. The study offers insights into twist&#8208;controlled coexisting ferro&#8208;ordering and serves as valuable spectroscopic tools.

         <title>Toward a Radically Simple Multi&#8208;Modal Nasal Spray for Preventing Respiratory Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathogen capture and neutralizing spray (PCANS) is reported to prevent respiratory infections through a multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets and serving as a physical barrier against viruses and bacteria, while neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. In mice, PCANS shows nasal retention for &#8776;8 hours and offers pre&#8208;exposure protection against lethal viral infections.








Abstract
Nasal sprays for pre&#8208;exposure prophylaxis against respiratory infections show limited protection (20&#8211;70%), largely due to their single mechanism of action&#8212;either neutralizing pathogens or blocking their entry at the nasal lining, and a failure to maximize the capture of respiratory droplets, allowing them to potentially rebound and reach deeper airways. This report introduces the Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS), which utilizes a multi&#8208;modal approach to enhance efficacy. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA's Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre&#8208;exposure dose of PCANS leads to a &gt;99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily&#8208;use prophylactic against respiratory infections.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanoribbon with Ultra&#8208;High Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Polarization Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the anisotropy of the ultra&#8208;wide bandgap semiconductor &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3, it can be prepared as a solar&#8208;blind UV detector and is intrinsically sensitive to polarized light without the need of polarizers. This &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8208;based detector has an ultra&#8208;high polarization ratio and is commercially viable. This suggests a new strategy for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarization detection and also provides promising solar&#8208;blind optical communication.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) detection plays a critical role in imaging and communication due to its low&#8208;noise background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and strong anti&#8208;interference capabilities. Detecting the polarization state of UV light can enhance image information and expand the communication dimension. Although polarization detection is explored in visible and infrared light, and applied in fields such as astrophysics and submarine seismic wave detection, solar&#8208;blind UV polarization detection remains largely unreported. This is primarily due to the challenge of creating UV polarizers with high transmittance, high extinction ratio, and strong resistance to UV radiation. In this study, it is discovered that the space symmetry breaking of the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8217;s b&#8211;c plane results in a significant optical absorption dichroic ratio. Leveraging &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8217;s high solar&#8208;blind UV response, a lensless solar&#8208;blind UV polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector, circumventing the challenges associated with solar&#8208;blind UV polarizers is designed. This photodetector exhibits an exceptionally high intrinsic polarization ratio under 254&#160;nm linearly polarized light, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than other reported nanomaterial&#8208;based polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Additionally, it demonstrates significant advantages in solar&#8208;blind UV imaging and light communication. This work introduces a novel strategy for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarization detection and offers a promising approach for solar&#8208;blind light communication.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) detection plays a critical role in imaging and communication due to its low-noise background, high signal-to-noise ratio, and strong anti-interference capabilities. Detecting the polarization state of UV light can enhance image information and expand the communication dimension. Although polarization detection is explored in visible and infrared light, and applied in fields such as astrophysics and submarine seismic wave detection, solar-blind UV polarization detection remains largely unreported. This is primarily due to the challenge of creating UV polarizers with high transmittance, high extinction ratio, and strong resistance to UV radiation. In this study, it is discovered that the space symmetry breaking of the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s b&#8211;c plane results in a significant optical absorption dichroic ratio. Leveraging &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s high solar-blind UV response, a lensless solar-blind UV polarization-sensitive photodetector, circumventing the challenges associated with solar-blind UV polarizers is designed. This photodetector exhibits an exceptionally high intrinsic polarization ratio under 254&#160;nm linearly polarized light, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than other reported nanomaterial-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. Additionally, it demonstrates significant advantages in solar-blind UV imaging and light communication. This work introduces a novel strategy for solar-blind ultraviolet polarization detection and offers a promising approach for solar-blind light communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complex Deformation in Soft Cylindrical Structures via Programmable Sequential Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>The buckling of cylindrical shell structures upon depressurization is a well&#8208;known phenomenon. If the shells are made of soft materials, the post&#8208;buckling deformation can be fully recovered. Through a combination of experiments and simulations, the occurrence of a secondary instability in shells with a high buckling wave number is identified, which suddenly activates a coupled twisting&#8208;folding deformation mode. This rich nonlinear behavior is harnessed to design soft robotic systems capable of executing sequential tasks with a single input signal.








Abstract
The substantial deformation exhibited by hyperelastic cylindrical shells under pressurization makes them an ideal platform for programmable inflatable structures. If negative pressure is applied, the cylindrical shell will buckle, leading to a sequence of rich deformation modes, all of which are fully recoverable due to the hyperelastic material choice. While the initial buckling event under vacuum is well understood, here, the post&#8208;buckling regime is explored and a region in the design space is identified in which a coupled twisting&#8208;contraction deformation mode occurs; by carefully controlling the geometry of&#160;our homogeneous shells, the proportion of contraction versus twist can be controlled. Additionally, bending as a post&#8208;buckling deformation mode can be unlocked by varying the thickness of&#160;our shells across the circumference. Since these soft shells can fully recover from substantial deformations caused by buckling, then these instability&#8208;driven deformations are harnessed to build soft machines capable of a programmable sequence of movements with a single actuation&#160;input.

         <title>Ions&#8208;induced Assembly of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</title>

This paper presents an ions&#8208;induced crystallization method to synthesize perovskite dual&#8208;phase nanocomposites of CsPbBr3 and Cs4PbBr6. This approach enlarges grain sizes, reduces trap density, and improves both light extraction efficiency and electrical characteristics. Consequently, green perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a maximum external quantum efficiencie exceeding 30% and a narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, a cost&#8208;effective class of semiconductos, hold great promise for display technologies that demand high&#8208;efficiency, color&#8208;pure light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Early research on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites showed low radiative efficiencies due to modest exciton binding energies. To inprove luminescence, reducing dimensionality or grain size has been a common approach. However, dividing the perovskite lattice into smaller units may hinder carrier transport, compromising electrical performance. Moreover, the increased surface area introduce additional surface trap states, leading to greater non&#8208;radiative recombination. Here, an ions&#8208;induced growth method is employed to assembe lattice&#8208;anchored perovskite nanocomposites for efficient LEDs with high color purity. This approach enables the nanocomposite thin films, composed of 3D CsPbBr3 and its variant of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs4PbBr6, to feature significant low trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, enhanced light out&#8208;coupling with a corrugated surface, and well&#8208;balanced charge carrier transport. Based on the resultant 3D/0D perovskite nanocomposites, the perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) achieving an remarkable external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm with a narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of only 18 nm. This sets a new benchmark for color purity in high performance PeLED research, highlighting the significant advantage of this approach.

         <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface&#8208;State&#8208;Mediated Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient current&#8208;driven spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching is observed in a hard ferromagnetic topological insulator (TI), V&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST), with a record large switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 k&#937; by current. The SOT efficiency is significantly enhanced by Fermi level tuning, as VBST exhibits a transition from edge&#8208;state&#8208;mediated to surface&#8208;state&#8208;mediated transport.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states (TSS) with ultrahigh efficiency. Here, efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST), with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field, is demonstrated. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 k&#937; is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems, which makes the Hall channel a good readout and eliminates the need to fabricate complicated magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structures. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to 2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high efficiency. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge&#8208;state&#8208;mediated to surface&#8208;state&#8208;mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to (1.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12)&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;T&#160;A&#8722;1&#160;cm2 and the interfacial charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency to 3.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3 nm&#8722;1. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices.

         <title>Elastocaloric Heat Pump by Twist Induced Periodical Non&#8208;Linear Stress for Low Hysteresis and High Carnot Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber twisting induces periodic non&#8208;linear stress, leading to high elastocaloric performance and material COP. A novel elastocaloric heat pump is designed using this technique, incorporating a three&#8208;port valve and a pump to separate the cooling and heating media, which results in low hysteresis, high efficiency, enhanced durability, and excellent cooling.









Abstract
Elastocaloric cooling is one of the most promising solid&#8208;state cooling approaches to address the issues of energy shortage and global warming. However, the cooling efficiency and cycle life of this technology need to be improved, and the required driving force shall be reduced. Here, a novel elastocaloric heat pump by periodic non&#8208;linear stress is developed by employing fiber twisting and separated cooling and heating media. The non&#8208;linear stress generated by fiber twisting yields a hierarchical, rigid&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible architecture and a periodic entropy spatial distribution, which result in a low mechanical hysteresis work and a high cooling efficiency (a maximum material coefficient of performance (COP) of 30.8 and a maximum Carnot efficiency of 82%). The torsional non&#8208;linear stress inhibits crack propagation and results in a highly extended cycle life (14752 cycles, more than ten times of fiber stretching). The heat pump exhibits a maximum average temperature span of 25.6 K, a maximum specific cooling power of 1850&#160;W Kg&#8722;1, a maximum device COP of 19.5, and a maximum device power of 5.0&#160;W, under each optimal condition.

The heat pump exhibits a maximum average temperature span of 25.6 K, a maximum specific cooling power of 1850&#160;W Kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum device &lt;i&gt;COP&lt;/i&gt; of 19.5, and a maximum device power of 5.0&#160;W, under each optimal condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Perspective on Electrochemical Point Source Utilization of CO2 and Other Flue Gas Components to Value Added Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective covers the material design strategies for the Electrochemical Point Source Utilization of CO2 and Other Flue Gas Components to Value Added Chemicals. It also highlights how lab&#8208;scale catalysis can be translated to real&#8208;time industrial level consumption of flue gas mixture by electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been explored extensively for mitigation of noxious CO2 gas generating C1 and C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates as value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals with remarkable selectivity. The source of CO2 being a pure CO2 feed, it does not fully satisfy the real&#8208;time digestion of industrial exhausts. Besides the detrimental effect of noxious gas mixture leading to global warming, there is a huge capital investment in purifying the flue gas mixtures from industries. The presence of other impurity gases affects the eCO2RR mechanism and its activity and selectivity toward C2+ products dwindle drastically. Impurities like NOx, SOx, O2, N2, and halide ions present in flue gas mixture reduce the conversion and selectivity of eCO2RR significantly. Instead of wiping out these impurities via separation processes, new strategies from material chemistry and electrochemistry can open new avenues for turning foes to friends! In this perspective, the co&#8208;electroreduction will vividly discussed and supporting role of different heteroatom&#8208;containing impurity gases with CO2, generating highly stable C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, C&#9472;X bonds, and highlight the existing limitations and providing probable solutions for attaining further success in this field and translating this to industrial exhaust streams.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Crosslinker for Efficient Photo&#8208;Patterning of Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conjugated polymer&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinker, PN3, with phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in the side chains, is developed for efficient photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with superior performance, featuring a significantly low UV light exposure dose, high sensitivity (S), and high contrast (&#947;).








Abstract
Photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors using photo&#8208;crosslinkers has shown potential for organic circuit fabrication via solution processing techniques. However, the performance of patterning, including resolution (R), UV light exposure dose, sensitivity (S), and contrast (&#947;), remains unsatisfactory. In this study, a novel conjugated polymer based photo&#8208;crosslinker (PN3, Figure 1a) is reported for the first time, which entails phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in its side chains. Due to the potential &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the conjugated backbone of PN3 and those of polymer semiconductors, PN3 exhibits superior miscibility with polymer semiconductors compared to the commonly used small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinker 4Bx (Figure 1a). Consequently, photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with PN3 demonstrates improved performance with much lower UV light exposure dose, higher S and higher &#947; compared to 4Bx. By utilizing electron beam lithography, patterned arrays of polymer semiconductors with resolutions down to 500&#160;nm and clearer edges are successfully fabricated using PN3. Furthermore, patterned arrays of PDPP4T, the p&#8208;type semiconductor (Figure 1b), after being doped, can function as source&#8208;drain electrodes for fabricating field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with comparable charge mobility and significantly lower sub&#8208;threshold swing value compared to those with gold electrodes.

         <title>Controlling the Relaxation Dynamics of Polymer Networks by Combining Associative and Dissociative Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The network topology and spatial structure of dynamic covalent polymer networks can be designed independently from their temporal structure and dynamic nature by the judicious combination of two distinctly different dynamic covalent chemistries. This enables improved extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing, healing without creep and shape memory at time scales where the dissociative chemistry is activated and the associative chemistry remains inactive.








Abstract
Dynamic polymer networks offer a promising solution to key challenges in polymers such as recyclability, processability, and damage repair. However, the trade&#8208;off between combining facile processability, fast self&#8208;healing, and high creep resistance remains a major obstacle to implementation. To overcome this, two very distinct dynamic covalent chemistries, Diels&#8211;Alder and transesterification, is combined in a single network. The resulting dual dynamic networks offer an unprecedented set of properties and control over the relaxation times. The system decouples the relaxation dynamics of the network from the spatial motifs, and the tuning of the ratio between chemistries enables to control of the relaxation dynamics over six orders of magnitude. Taking advantage of this control, the composition and rheological behavior is optimized to drastically improve the resolution for extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing of dynamic covalent networks. Additionally, two well&#8208;defined and separated stress relaxation peaks are observed at compositions close to 50% of each dynamic chemistry, accentuating the double character of the system's relaxation dynamics. This atypical situation, enables to preparation of self&#8208;healing materials with negligible creep, and with shape&#8208;memory properties solely leveraging the two distinct relaxation dynamics, instead of the glass transition temperature or the melting point.

         <title>Customized Corneal Cross&#8208;Linking with Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Riboflavin Delivery for Keratoconus Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel customized corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL) treatment, which utilizes microneedles for targeted riboflavin administration, not only achieves exceptional customized CXL effects comparable to the conventional epi&#8208;off CXL protocol, but also improves visual function by flattening the corneal curvature within the treated zone, paving the way for customized CXL treatment of keratoconus and other corneal pathologies.








Abstract
In this study, a novel customized corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL) treatment is explored that utilizes microneedles (MNs) for targeted riboflavin (RF) administration prior to the CXL procedure. Unlike the conventional &#8220;one&#8208;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; approach, this protocol offers an option for more precise and efficacious treatment. To simulate a customized corneal crosslinking technique, four distinct microneedle (MN) molds designs, including circular, semi&#8208;circular, annular and butterfly shaped, are crafted for loading an optimized RF&#8208;hyaluronic acid solution and for the subsequent fabrication of MN arrays with varying morphologies. These MNs can gently puncture the corneal epithelium while preserving the integrity of the underlying stromal layer. Following the application of these microneedles, RF solution is replenished to enhance the RF content within the stroma through the punctures created by the MNs, resulting in exceptional customized corneal cross&#8208;linking effects that are comparable to the conventional epi&#8208;off CXL protocol. Additionally, it flattened the corneal curvature within the treated zone and facilitated rapid postoperative recovery of corneal tissue. These findings suggest that the integration of customized microneedle RF delivery with corneal crosslinking technology represents a potential novel treatment modality, holding promise for the tailored treatment of corneal pathologies, and offering a more precise and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

         <title>Upcycling the Spent Graphite Anode Into the Prelithiation Catalyst: A Separator Strategy Toward Anode&#8208;Free Cell Prototyping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Value&#8208;added recycling of spent anode has become an urgent need for the circular battery manufacturing. In this work, Yao et&#160;al. developed an &#8220;integrated closed&#8208;loop route&#8221; to upgrade the spent graphite into the prelithiation catalyst upon the fine tuning of the interlayer spacing and defect concentration, enabling customized prelithiation for the Li&#8208;deficient electrodes. It fulfills both the sustainable supply chain and battery prototyping with higher energy efficiency.








Abstract
The substantial manufacturing of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires sustainable, circular, and decarbonized recycling strategies. While efforts are concentrated on extracting valuable metals from cathodes using intricate chemical process, the direct, efficient cathode regeneration remains a technological challenge. More urgently, the battery supply chain also requires the value&#8208;added exploitation of retired anodes. Here, a &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; approach is proposed to upcycle spent graphite into the prelithiation catalyst, namely the fewer&#8208;layer graphene flakes (FGF), upon the exquisite tuning of interlayer spacing and defect concentration. Since the catalytic FGF mitigates the delithiation energy barrier from calcinated Li5FeO4 nanocrystalline, the composite layer of which cast on the polyolefin substrate thus enables a customized prelithiation capability (98% Li+ utilization) for the retired LiFePO4 recovery. Furthermore, the hydrophobic polymeric modification guarantees the moisture tolerance of Li5FeO4 agents, aligning with commercial battery manufacturing standards. The separator strategy well regulates the interfacial chemistry in the anode&#8208;free pouch cell (LiFePO4||Cu), the prototype of which balances the robust cyclability, energy density up to 386.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as the extreme power output of 1159.8&#160;W kg&#8722;1. This study not only fulfills the sustainable supply chain with graphite upcycling, but also establishes a generic, viable protocol for the anode&#8208;free cell prototyping.

         <title>Bioinspired Homonuclear Diatomic Iron Active Site Regulation for Efficient Antifouling Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by structural and functional models of natural cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the conformations of the 2 hemes intrinsic to CcO can inspire the biomimetic active site regulation of nanozymes with powerful ROS generation capability for efficient antifouling osmotic energy conversion is demonstrated. The power density of bioinspired membranes reached 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and the antimicrobial performance increased 44.5&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis is globally recognized as a promising technology for harnessing osmotic energy. However, its practical application is greatly restricted by the poor anti&#8208;fouling ability of existing membrane materials. Inspired by the structural and functional models of natural cytochrome c oxidases (CcO), the first use of atomically precise homonuclear diatomic iron composites as high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion membranes with excellent anti&#8208;fouling ability is demonstrated. Through rational tuning of the atomic configuration of the diatomic iron sites, the oxidase&#8208;like activity can be precisely tailored, leading to the augmentation of ion throughput and anti&#8208;fouling capacity. Composite membranes featuring direct Fe&#8208;Fe motif configurations embedded within cellulose nanofibers (CNF/Fe&#8208;DACs&#8208;P) surpass state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CNF&#8208;based membranes with power densities of ca. 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and a 44.5&#8208;fold enhancement in antimicrobial performance. Combined, experimental characterization and density functional theory simulations reveal that homonuclear diatomic iron sites with metal&#8208;metal interactions can achieve ideally balanced adsorption and desorption of intermediates, thus realizing superior oxidase&#8208;like activity, enhanced ionic flux, and excellent antibacterial activity.

         <title>Robust Growth of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Vertical Heterostructures via Ammonium&#8208;Assisted CVD Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a universal strategy for robust growth of high&#8208;quality transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) vertical heterostructures and a novel design concept for the fabrication of high mobility and high responsivity photodetectors based on 2D TMD vertical heterostructures, which holds promise for the next&#8208;generation photodetectors.








Abstract
Two dimension (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) heterostructures have opened unparalleled prospects for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications due to their atomic&#8208;scale thickness and distinct physical properties. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is the most feasible approach to prepare 2D TMD heterostructures. However, the synthesis of 2D vertical heterostructures faces competition between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth, which makes it difficult to precisely control the growth of vertical heterostructures. Here, a universal and controllable strategy is reported to grow various 2D TMD vertical heterostructures through an ammonium&#8208;assisted CVD process. The ammonium&#8208;assisted strategy shows excellent controllability and operational simplicity to prevent interlayer diffusion/alloying and thermal decomposition of the existed TMD templates. Ab initio simulations demonstrate that the reaction between NH4Cl and MoS2 leads to the formation of MoS3 clusters, promoting the nucleation and growth of 2D MoS2 on existed 2D WS2 layer, thereby leading to the growth of vertical heterostructure. The resulting 2D WSe2/WS2 vertical heterostructure photodetectors demonstrate an outstanding optoelectronic performance, which are comparable to the performances of photodetectors fabricated from mechanically exfoliated and stacked vertical heterostructures. The ammonium&#8208;assisted strategy for robust growth of high&#8208;quality vertical van der Waals heterostructures will facilitate fundamental physics investigations and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Manipulated Optical Chirality in Ferroelectric Vortex Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly ferroelectric nanoislands with polar vortex domains and optical chirality, are designed and fabricated, leading to a reversible and nonvolatile on/off switching of optical chirality by electric fields. Such ferroelectric nanoislands, serving as discrete chiral units, can be integrated into ordered arrays and exhibit capabilities in chiral optical display functionalities.








Abstract
Manipulating optical chirality via electric fields has garnered considerable attention in the realm of both fundamental physics and practical applications. Chiral ferroelectrics, characterized by their inherent optical chirality and switchable spontaneous polarization, are emerging as a promising platform for electronic&#8208;photonic integrated circuits applications. Unlike organics with chiral carbon centers, integrating chirality into technologically mature inorganic ferroelectrics has posed a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, the successful introduction of chirality is reported into self&#8208;assembly La&#8208;doped BiFeO3 nanoislands, which exhibit ferroelectric vortex domains. By employing synergistic experimental techniques with piezoresponse force microscopy and nonlinear optical second&#8208;harmonic generation probes, a clear correlation between chirality and polarization configuration within these ferroelectric nanoislands is established. Furthermore, the deterministic control of ferroelectric vortex domains and chirality is demonstrated by applying electric fields, enabling reversible and nonvolatile generation and elimination of optically chiral signals. These findings significantly expand the repertoire of field&#8208;controllable chiral systems and lay the groundwork for the development of innovative ferroelectric optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of the Underlying Energy Storage Mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based Pseudo&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>

In this study, the pseudo&#8208;capacitive reaction mechanism of manganese dioxide (&#945;&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;supercapacitor is revealed in three ionic liquids by using in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy and further investigating the cycled product of macro&#8208;supercapacitor. The underlying faradic reaction mechanisms of pseudo&#8208;capacitance and superior performance are thoroughly elucidated through extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses, providing insights into the selection of electrolytes in &#945;&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (&#945;&#8208;MnO2) has attracted significant research interest in supercapacitors recently. However, the reaction mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in supercapacitors remains unclear. Therefore, a nano&#8208;supercapacitor using Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) is conducted and investigated the reaction mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 based on three ionic liquids (ILs). It found that in the aprotic ionic liquid (AIL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (EMIMOTF), &#945;&#8208;MnO2 nanowires (NWs) undergo an oxidation reaction due to the presence of an active proton at the second position (H2) of the imidazole ring. As a result, &#945;&#8208;MnO2 NWs undergo a phase transition and transform into Mn3O4, exhibiting pseudo&#8208;capacitive properties. Furthermore, characterization of the macroscopic &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrodes after cycling reveals that after the initial charging cycles, the dominant energy storage mechanism of the supercapacitor transitions from pseudo&#8208;capacitance to a dual&#8208;layer capacitance formed by the combination of Mn3O4 and unreacted &#945;&#8208;MnO2. Simultaneously, due to the coexistence of these two energy storage mechanisms, the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor in EMIMOTF electrolyte reaches up to 80 F g&#8722;1, and the cycle number reaches as high as 1000 cycles. The results are expected to provide insights into the selection of electrolytes in supercapacitors and offer a fundamental understanding of the internal reaction mechanisms in capacitors.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Process, Fine&#8208;Grained, and Quantitative Rehabilitation Assessment Platform Enabled by On&#8208;Skin Sensors and Multi&#8208;Task Gait Transformer Model</title>

         <dc:description>
This work develops a full&#8208;process, fine&#8208;grained, and quantitative rehabilitation assessments platform (RAP) supported by on&#8208;skin sensors and a multi&#8208;task gait transformer model for patients with lower limb movement disorders. The RAP can perform multiple assessments including fall risk, walking ability, and rehabilitation progress, covering the whole process of rehabilitation and realizing objective and quantitative rehabilitation assessment.








Abstract
Rehabilitation of patients with lower limb movement disorders is a gradual process, which requires full&#8208;process assessments to guide the implementation of rehabilitation plans. However, the current methods can only complete the assessment in one stage and lack objective and quantitative assessment strategies. Here, a full&#8208;process, fine&#8208;grained, and quantitative rehabilitation assessments platform (RAP) supported by on&#8208;skin sensors and a multi&#8208;task gait transformer (MG&#8208;former) model for patients with lower limb movement disorders is developed. The signal quality and sensitivity of on&#8208;skin sensor is improved by the synthesis of high&#8208;performance triboelectric material and structure design. The MG&#8208;former model can simultaneously perform multiple tasks including binary classification, multiclassification, and regression, corresponding to assessment of fall risk, walking ability, and rehabilitation progress, covering the whole rehabilitation cycle. The RAP can assess the walking ability of 23 hemiplegic patients, which has highly consistent results with the scores by the experienced physician. Furthermore, the MG&#8208;former model outputs fine&#8208;grained assessment results when performing regression task to track slight progress of patients that cannot be captured by conventional scales, facilitating adjustment of rehabilitation plans. This work provides an objective and quantitative platform, which is instructive for physicians and patients to implement effective strategy throughout the whole rehabilitation process.

         <title>A Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate&#8208;Based Nanoplatform for Immunometabolic Activation and In Situ Nerve Regeneration in Advanced&#8208;Stage Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;drug conjugate&#8208;based nanoplatform is designed to deliver hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to microglia and astrocytes, respectively. The critical immune&#8208;metabolic pathway in microglia is significantly activated to reverse the immune tolerance. Astrocytes are in situ trans&#8208;differentiated into functional neurons. This nanoplatform significantly inhibits the progression of advanced&#8208;stage Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD).








Abstract
The formidable protection of physiological barriers and unclear pathogenic mechanisms impede drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As defenders of the central nervous system, immune&#8208;metabolism function, and stemness of glial cells remain dormant during degeneration, representing a significant challenge for simultaneously targeting and modulating. Here, a modular nanoplatform is presented composed of peptide&#8208;drug conjugates and an inflammation&#8208;responsive core. The nanoplatform is transported through the blood&#8208;brain barrier via transcytosis and disassembles in the oxidative stress microenvironment upon intravenous administration. The released drug&#8208;conjugated modules can specifically target and deliver hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to microglia and astrocytes, respectively. The immune function of chronic tolerant microglia is activated by metabolic modulation, and reactive astrocytes trans&#8208;differentiate into functional neurons. In a transgenic mouse model, nanoplatform reduces levels of toxic proteins and inflammation while increasing neuronal density. This results in the amelioration of learning and memory decline. The modular nanoplatform provides design principles for multi&#8208;cellular targeting and combination nano&#8208;therapy for inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

This study demonstrates the use of grayscale DLP 3D printing to fabricate polymeric composites with tailored conductivity. By manipulating light intensity and incorporating lithium ions, the process enables the creation of materials with conductivity differences exceeding three orders of magnitude, paving the way for low&#8208;cost, rapid production of intricate electronic circuits and sensors.








Abstract
Fabricating polymeric composites with desirable characteristics for electronic applications is a complex and costly process. Digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing emerges as a promising technique for manufacturing intricate structures. In this study, polymeric samples are fabricated with a conductivity difference exceeding three orders of magnitude in various portions of a part by employing grayscale DLP (g&#8208;DLP) single&#8208;vat single&#8208;cure 3D printing deliberate resin design. This is realized through the manipulation of light intensity during the curing process. Specifically, the rational resin design with added lithium ions results in the polymer cured under the maximum UV&#8208;light intensity exhibiting higher electrical resistance. Conversely, sections that are only partially cured retains uncured monomers, serving as a medium that facilitates ion mobility, consequently leading to higher conductivity. The versatility of g&#8208;DLP allows precise control of light intensity in different regions during the printing process. This characteristic opens up possibilities for applications, notably the low&#8208;cost, facile, and rapid production of complex electrical circuits and sensors. The utilization of this technique makes it feasible to fabricate materials with tailored conductivity and functionality, providing an innovative pathway to advance the accelerated and facile creation of sophisticated electronic devices.

         <title>Enhanced Intramolecular Hole Transfer in Block Copolymer Enables &gt;15% and Operational Stable Single&#8208;Material&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of different synthetic protocols of block copolymer (BCP) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. The more phase pure direct synthesis BCP exhibits enhanced intramolecular hole transfer, leading to a record efficiency of over 15% for single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells together with excellent long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Recent studies on narrow bandgap all&#8208;conjugated block copolymer (BCP) single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have made unprecedented progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE); however, it still lacks understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these highly mixed materials. Herein, the impact of different synthetic protocols (direct synthesis (d&#8208;BCP) versus sequential synthesis (s&#8208;BCP)) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. Targeting the same BCP, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, it is found that the change in polymerization reaction leads to quite different optical and transport properties. The d&#8208;BCP outputs a record&#8208;high PCE of 15.02% for SMOSCs as well as enhanced operation stability under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which is significantly higher than that of s&#8208;BCP (10.33%) and even close to its bulk heterojunction (BHJ) counterparts. Detailed transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer (CT) and exciton dissociation in BCP. In together with morphology characterization, it is revealed that the d&#8208;BCP has more phase pure composition, enhanced molecular ordering, and higher intramolecular CT efficiency relative to those of s&#8208;BCP. These findings gain insight into both the structure and carrier dynamic of BCP and demonstrate the possibility of achieving high&#8208;efficiency and stable SMOSCs.

     alt="Enhanced Intramolecular Hole Transfer in Block Copolymer Enables &amp;gt;15% and Operational Stable Single-Material&#8211;Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of different synthetic protocols of block copolymer (BCP) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. The more phase pure direct synthesis BCP exhibits enhanced intramolecular hole transfer, leading to a record efficiency of over 15% for single-material&#8211;organic solar cells together with excellent long-term operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on narrow bandgap all-conjugated block copolymer (BCP) single-material&#8211;organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have made unprecedented progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE); however, it still lacks understanding of the structure-property relationship in these highly mixed materials. Herein, the impact of different synthetic protocols (direct synthesis (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-BCP) versus sequential synthesis (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-BCP)) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. Targeting the same BCP, namely PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PYIT, it is found that the change in polymerization reaction leads to quite different optical and transport properties. The &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-BCP outputs a record-high PCE of 15.02% for SMOSCs as well as enhanced operation stability under simulated 1-sun illumination, which is significantly higher than that of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-BCP (10.33%) and even close to its bulk heterojunction (BHJ) counterparts. Detailed transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer (CT) and exciton dissociation in BCP. In together with morphology characterization, it is revealed that the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-BCP has more phase pure composition, enhanced molecular ordering, and higher intramolecular CT efficiency relative to those of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-BCP. These findings gain insight into both the structure and carrier dynamic of BCP and demonstrate the possibility of achieving high-efficiency and stable SMOSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polypyridiniums with Inherent Autophagy&#8208;Inducing Activity for Atherosclerosis Treatment by Intracellularly Co&#8208;Delivering Two Antioxidant Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polypyridiniums are proposed to effectively deliver two antioxidant enzymes into cytosolic of treated cells to down&#8208;regulate lipopolysaccharide induced ROS. Moreover, the material itself can efficiently activate the autophagy in macrophages and inhibit foam cell formation. After being coated with neutrophil membranes, the polymer/protein complexes successfully halted the progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE&#8208;/&#8208; mice upon intravenous injection.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial intima and is becoming the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is considerable evidence that defective autophagy and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Here, a polymer is developed with the inherent autophagy&#8208;inducing activity to treat atherosclerosis by co&#8208;delivering antioxidant enzymes. The lead material P5c screened from a library of polypyridiniums shows robust efficacy in cytosolic protein delivery, and efficiently delivers superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) into macrophages to down&#8208;regulate intracellular ROS. Moreover, P5c activates autophagy in macrophages and sufficiently inhibits foam cell formation. The P5c nanoparticle loaded with both SOD and CAT is further coated with neutrophil membranes to treat atherosclerosis in an ApoE&#8722;/&#8722; mice model. The treatment exhibits potent anti&#8208;atherosclerosis effect via activating autophagy, decreasing the infiltration of senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques, regulating the M2 polarization of macrophages, and restoring the structure and function of splenic corpuscles. The polymer offers a multifaceted approach to combat atherosclerosis, addressing both cellular dysfunction and the need for targeted protein delivery within affected cells.

         <title>Giant Capacitive Energy Storage in High&#8208;Entropy Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics with Temperature Self&#8208;Check</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, octahedral tilt and cationic displacement are observed in high entropy (HE) BNT&#8208; based ceramics. On the basis of tape&#8208;casting process and cold isostatic pressing, the optimal ceramics display a large Wrec (10.46 J cm&#8722;3) at 685 kV cm&#8722;1 and a high power density (332.88 MW cm&#8722;3). Importantly, Tm/Yb codoping endows the ceramics with fluorescent temperature self&#8208;check feature.








Abstract
Considering the large demand for electricity in the era of artificial intelligence and big data, there is an urgent need to explore novel energy storage media with higher energy density and intelligent temperature self&#8208;check functions. High&#8208;entropy (HE) ceramic capacitors are of great significance because of their excellent energy storage efficiency and high power density (PD). However, the contradiction between configurational entropy and polarization in traditional HE systems greatly restrains the increase in energy storage density. Herein, the contradiction is effectively solved by regulating the octahedral tilt and cationic displacement in ABO3&#8208;type perovskite HE ceramics, i.e., (1&#8208;x)[0.6(Bi0.47Na0.47Yb0.03Tm0.01)TiO3&#8208;0.4(Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3]&#8208;xSr(Zr0.5Hf0.5)O3 (BNYTT&#8208;BST&#8208;xSZH). Combining the tape&#8208;casting process and cold isostatic pressing, the optimal BNYTT&#8208;BST&#8208;0.06SZH ceramic displays a large recoverable energy storage density (10.46 J cm&#8722;3) at 685&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and a high PD (332.88 MW cm&#8722;3). More importantly, due to Tm/Yb codoping, abnormal fluorescent negative thermal expansion and excellent real&#8208;time temperature sensing are developed, thus the application of fault detection and warning in high&#8208;voltage transmission line systems is conceptualized. This study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the polarization of energy&#8208;storing HE ceramics and offers a promising material for overcoming the problems of insufficient capacitor density and thermal runaway in terminal communication.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals&#8208;Intermediated Hydrogel for Boosting the Biosensing Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 core/shell hetero perovskite nanocrystals with superior water stability are obtained via a trinity strategy by integrating Mn (II) substitution with CsPb2Cl5 inert shell and NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH coating. Hetero perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based hydrogel biosensor provides pesticide information on food products, achieving on&#8208;site monitoring of chlorpyrifos at the nanogram per milliliter level.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have become attractive nanomaterials for advanced biosensors, yet the structural design remains challenging due to the trade&#8208;off between environmental stability and sensing sensitivity. Herein, a trinity strategy is proposed to address this issue by integrating Mn (II) substitution with CsPb2Cl5 inert shell and NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH coating for designing Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 core/shell hetero perovskite nanocrystals (PMCP PNCs). The trinity strategy isolates the emissive Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 core from water and the Mn2+ d&#8211;d transition generates photoluminescence with a long lifetime, endowing the NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH capped Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 PNCs with robust water stability and oxygen&#8208;sensitive property. Given the structural integration, photoluminescent hydrogel biosensors are designed by embedding the PMCP PNCs into the hydrogel system to deliver on&#8208;site pesticide information on food products. Impressively, benefiting from the dual enzyme triggered&#8208;responsive property of PMCP PNCs, the hydrogel biosensor is endowed with ultra&#8208;high sensitivity toward chlorpyrifos pesticide at the nanogram per milliliter level. Such a robust PMCP PNCs&#8208;based hydrogel sensor can provide accurate pesticide information while guiding the construction of photoluminescent biosensors for upcoming on&#8208;site applications.

         <title>Enhanced Colorimetric Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Dye&#8208;Incorporated Photonic Crystal&#8208;Based Sensor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array composed of dye&#8208;incorporated colloidal photonic crystals is fabricated for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The overlap between the photonic bandgap edge and the absorption peak of the dye enhances color changes. The sensor array generates distinct color difference maps for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid, respectively, with the limit of detection as low as 0.02&#160;ppm, without any data amplification.








Abstract
Chemoresponsive dyes offer the potential to selectively detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) unique to certain disease states. Among different VOC sensing techniques, colorimetric sensing offers the advantage of facile recognition. However, it is often challenging to discern the color changes by the naked eye. Here, highly sensitive colorimetric VOC sensor arrays from dye&#8208;incorporated colloidal photonic crystals (dye&#8208;cPhCs) are reported. cPhCs are scalably fabricated on a 4&#8208;inch wafer by spin&#8208;coating of silica nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable monomer, where the gradient shear flow along the film thickness creates densely&#8208;packed square arrays of NPs in the top layers, whereas the bulk is quasi&#8208;amorphous with larger periodicities. The broadened reflection peak allows for augmented dye absorption originating from the overlap between the photonic bandgap edge of the cPhC and the dye absorption peak, leading to a more noticeable color change upon exposure to VOCs. The sensor array generates distinct color difference maps for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid, respectively, without any data amplification. The limit of detection for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid is 1, 0.1, and 0.02&#160;ppm, respectively. Moreover, VOC can be diagonalized by visually intuitive pattern recognition, and principal component analysis at reduced dimensionality is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A colorimetric sensor array composed of dye-incorporated colloidal photonic crystals is fabricated for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The overlap between the photonic bandgap edge and the absorption peak of the dye enhances color changes. The sensor array generates distinct color difference maps for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid, respectively, with the limit of detection as low as 0.02&#160;ppm, without any data amplification.

         <title>Homogenizing Energy Landscape for Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual modification on both bulk and interface is proposed to homogenize the energy landscape throughout the entire blue perovskite by comprehensively diminishing the low dimensional phases and reducing the halide defects. Resultantly, perovskite light emitting diodes with spectrally&#8208;stable blue emission at 478 nm and a high external quantum efficiency of 21.9% are realized, representing a record in this type of devices. 








Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have attracted enormous attention; however, their unsatisfactory device efficiency and spectral stability still remain great challenges. Unfavorable low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution and defects with deeper energy levels usually cause energy disorder, substantially limiting the device's performance. Here, an additive&#8208;interface optimization strategy is reported to tackle these issues, thus realizing efficient and spectrally stable blue PeLEDs. A new type of additive&#8208;formamidinium tetrafluorosuccinate (FATFSA) is introduced into the quasi&#8208;2D mixed halide perovskite accompanied by interface engineering, which effectively impedes the formation of undesired low&#8208;dimensional phases with various bandgaps throughout the entire film, thereby boosting energy transfer process for accelerating radiative recombination; this strategy also diminishes the halide vacancies especially chloride&#8208;related defects with deep energy level, thus reducing nonradiative energy loss for efficient radiative recombination. Benefitting from homogenized energy landscape throughout the entire perovskite emitting layer, PeLEDs with spectrally&#8208;stable blue emission (478&#160;nm) and champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.9% are realized, which represents a record value among this type of PeLEDs in the pure blue region.

         <title>Constructing Organic Phosphorescent Scintillators with Enhanced Triplet Exciton Utilization Through Multi&#8208;Mode Radioluminescence for Efficient X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimode radioluminescence process is developed by thermally activating the release of triplet excitons from organic phosphorescent scintillators. These scintillators achieve a maximum photoluminescence efficiency of 65.8% and a minimum X&#8208;ray radiation detection limit of 110&#160;nGy&#160;s&#8722;1, enabling efficient radiographic imaging with a spatial resolution of &#8776;10.0&#160;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
The development of organic phosphorescent scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency has attracted significant attention but remains a difficult challenge because of the inherent spin&#8208;forbidden feature of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced triplet excitons. Herein, a design strategy is proposed to develop organic phosphorescent scintillators through thermally activated exciton release to convert stabilized spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons to spin&#8208;allowed singlet excitons, which enables singlet exciton&#8208;dominated multi&#8208;mode emission simultaneously from the lowest singlet, triplet, and stabilized triplet states. The resultant scintillators demonstrate a maximum photoluminescence efficiency of 65.8% and a minimum X&#8208;ray radiation detection limit of 110&#160;nGy&#160;s&#8722;1; this allows efficient radiography imaging with a spatial resolution of &#8776;10.0&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This study advances the fundamental understanding of exciton dynamics under X&#8208;ray excitation, significantly broadening the practical use of phosphorescent materials for safety&#8208;critical industries and medical diagnostics.

         <title>Confined Flash Printing and Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanofilms under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method, confined flash printing, allows for the rapid synthesis of perovskite nanofilms under ambient conditions. This approach combines precursor transfer, synthesis, crystallization, and polymer protection in a single step using a laser. The method's simplicity and flexibility support the development of various perovskite materials and devices, including applications in biodetection.








Abstract
The fabrication of stable perovskite nanofilm patterns is important for the development of functional optical devices. However, current production approaches are limited by the requirement for strict inert gas protection and long processing times. Here, a confined flash printing synthesis method is presented to generate perovskite nanofilms under ambient conditions, combining precursor transfer, perovskite synthesis, crystallization, and polymer protection in a single step within milliseconds. A laser simultaneously prints and induces the flash synthesis, confined in a polymer nanofilm, under normal ambient conditions. Due to its simplicity and flexibility, the method enables the combination and screening of many different perovskite precursor materials on various substrates. Besides for the development of novel perovskite materials and devices, the nanofilms can be applied for biodetection. The unique H2O2&#8208;responsive property of the ultrathin perovskite quantum dot film is applied for biomolecule detection based on oxidase&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Photochemical Control of Network Topology in PEG Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, maleimide&#8208; and styrene&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) macromers are used to prepare photocrosslinked hydrogels along a continuum of network topologies, from step&#8208; to chain&#8208;growth. This simple approach provides precise control over hydrogel nanostructure, decoupling gel modulus and diffusivity from the initial polymer content and presenting new opportunities for (bio)materials science and the study of soft matter physics.








Abstract
Hydrogels are often synthesized through photoinitiated step&#8208;, chain&#8208;, and mixed&#8208;mode polymerizations, generating diverse network topologies and resultant material properties that depend on the underlying network connectivity. While many photocrosslinking reactions are available, few afford controllable connectivity of the hydrogel network. Herein, a versatile photochemical strategy is introduced for tuning the structure of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels using macromolecular monomers functionalized with maleimide and styrene moieties. Hydrogels are prepared along a gradient of topologies by varying the ratio of step&#8208;growth (maleimide dimerization) to chain&#8208;growth (maleimide&#8208;styrene alternating copolymerization) network&#8208;forming reactions. The initial PEG content and final network physical properties (e.g., modulus, swelling, diffusivity) are tailored in an independent manner, highlighting configurable gel mechanics and reactivity. These photochemical reactions allow high&#8208;fidelity photopatterning and 3D printing and are compatible with 2D and 3D cell culture. Ultimately, this photopolymer chemistry allows facile control over network connectivity to achieve adjustable material properties for broad applications.

         <title>Microfiber Actuators With Hot&#8208;Pressing&#8208;Programmable Mechano&#8208;Photothermal Responses for Electromagnetic Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hot&#8208;pressing&#8208;programmable microfiber&#8208;film actuator is developed with mechano&#8208;photothermal cooperativities and electromagnetic radiation perceptivity (sensitivity of 99.73% &#177; 0.15%). It demonstrates superior actuation response with mechanical/thermal/electrical stability, and realizes an amphibious robot with land&#8211;water adaptive locomotion for electromagnetic dynamic detection. This microstructure&#8208;dominated electromagnetic&#8208;perceptive actuator can inspire a new direction of environment&#8208;interactive smart materials, and soft robots with multi&#8208;scenario adaptivity and autonomous environment perceptivity.








Abstract
Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is a ubiquitous harm and hard to detect dynamically in multiple scenarios. A mechano&#8208;photothermal cooperative microfiber film (MFF) actuator is developed that can synchronously detect EMR with high reliability. The programmable actuation is deployed by a hot&#8208;pressing methodology, achieving the MFF with moderate modulus (378&#160;MPa) and superior toughness (87.26&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that ensure superior response (0.068&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and bending curvature (0.63&#160;cm&#8722;1). A secondary hot&#8208;pressing can further program the actuation behavior with black phosphorus local photothermal enhancement patterns to achieve 2D&#8211;3D transformable geometries. An amphibious robot with a land&#8211;water adaptive locomotion mechanism is designed by programming the MFFs. It can crawl on land and locomote on water with a velocity up to &#8776;1.8&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1, and &#8776;2.39&#160;cm&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. Employing the conductive fabric layer of the actuator with electromagnetic induction effect, the amphibious robot can synchronously perceive environmental EMR with sensitivity up to 99.73%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.15% during locomotion, with superior adaptability to EMR source intensity (0.1 to 3000&#160;W) and distance (&#8776;9&#160;m) compared to a commercial EMR detector. This EMR detective microfiber actuator can inspire a new direction of environment&#8208;interactive smart materials, and soft robots with multi&#8208;scenario adaptivity and autonomous environment perceptivity.

         <title>From Simple Probe to Smart Composites: Water&#8208;Soluble Pincer Complex With Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble tripyridine Zn complex featuring a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure exhibited multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to water, pH, and heat. Its composite with polyvinyl alcohol found versatile applications covering digital encryption, reversible writing, inkless printing, and fingerprint analysis.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble smart materials with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have garnered broad attention. Herein, a water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complex (MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc), featuring a simple donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure is presented, which responds to a variety of stimuli, including changes in solvents, pH, temperature, and the addition of amino acids. Notably, MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc functions as a fluorescence probe, capable of visually and selectively discriminating aspartate or histidine among other common amino acids in water. Additionally, when incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form the composite MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc@PVA, the material exhibits reversible writing, photochromism, and a prolonged RTP with a 14 s afterglow. These unique properties enable the composite to be utilized in potential applications such as secure data encryption and inkless printing.

         <title>4D Printing Hybrid Soft Robots Enabled by Shape&#8208;Transformable Liquid Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of shape&#8208;transformable liquid metal nanoparticles (LMNPs) is first unveiled into 3D printing to create hybrid soft robots with controlled mechanical properties and deformability. This method allows direct printing of one&#8208;piece or assembled hybrid robots using a single LMNPs&#8208;integrated ink recipe, enabling precise control of mechanical and shape memory properties for applications like grippers, bioinspired motors, and rehabilitation devices.








Abstract
In recent years, soft robotics has emerged as a rapidly expanding frontier research field that draws inspiration from the locomotion mechanisms of soft&#8208;bodied creatures in nature to achieve smooth and complex motion for diverse applications. However, the fabrication of soft robots with hybrid structures remains challenging due to limitations in material selection and the complex, multi&#8208;step processes involved in traditional manufacturing methods. Herein, a novel direct one&#8208;step additive manufacturing (3D printing) approach is introduced for the fabrication of hybrid robots composed of soft and rigid components for sophisticated tasks. Inspired by the shape&#8208;transformable liquid metal nanoparticles (LMNPs), a functional material toolkit with tuneable mechanical properties and deformability is developed by integrating differently shaped gallium&#8208;based nanoparticles (GNPs) into the 3D printing polymers. Then the direct printing of assembled or one&#8208;piece hybrid soft&#8208;rigid robots is presented through a single recipe of GNPs&#8208;integrated inks. This fabrication method enables precise control of the mechanical properties and shape memory properties within the hybrid structures of robot body with a customized structure design. Their capabilities are further demonstrated through the design and fabrication of hybrid robots as high&#8208;precision gripper, bioinspired motor, and hand rehabilitation device.

         <title>Bifunctionally Electrocatalytic Bromine Redox Reaction by Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous carbon framework with dispersed single iron atom coordinated with nitrogen atom (FeN5) moiety dispersed (FeSAC&#8208;CMK) is developed as a conductive catalytic bromine host, which not only enhances the physicochemical adsorption of bromine species but also acts as a bifunctional electrocatalytic reactor to speed up redox kinetics of bromide/bromine (Br&#8722;/Br0) and free&#8208;up1/3 unserviceable Br&#8722; locked by tribromide (Br3&#8722;) via conversing Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722; redox reaction to Br0/Br&#8722; redox reaction for high energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn||Br2) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high safety, theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, the sluggish bromine redox kinetics and the formation of a soluble tribromide (Br3&#8722;) hinder their practical applications. Here, it is proposed dispersed single iron atom coordinated with nitrogen atoms (FeN5) in a mesoporous carbon framework (FeSAC&#8208;CMK) as a conductive catalytic bromine host, which possesses porous structure and electrocatalytic functionality of FeN5 species for enhanced confinement and electrocatalytic effect. The active FeN5 species can fix the bromine (Br0) species to suppress the formation of Br3&#8722; effectively and bifunctionally catalyze the bromide (Br&#8722;)/Br&#176; conversion. These free up 1/3 Br&#8722; locked by Br3&#8722; complexing agent for enhanced bromine utilization efficiency and conversion reversibility. Accordingly, the Zn||Br2 battery with FeSAC&#8208;CMK delivers an impressive specific capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and superior rate capability with 164 mAh g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20 A g&#8722;1, much higher than that of inactive CMK (262 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1; 6 mAh g&#8722;1 at only 8 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the battery demonstrates excellent cycling performance of 88% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Coordination Ligand for Multifunctional Sol&#8211;Gel Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to endow sol&#8211;gel oxide films with difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize useful functionalities, such as direct photolithography, high dielectric strength, and high mobility by replacing the native ligand of sol&#8211;gel oxide with strategically designed/synthesized functional ligands is presented. This demonstrated a high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed all&#8208;oxide patterning approach by controlling the functional ligands, facilitating a large&#8208;area oxide TFT array with high reliability.








Abstract
Here a ligand exchange strategy for synthesizing sol&#8211;gel oxides is demonstrated to achieve multifunctionality including direct photolithography, high dielectric strength, and high charge carrier mobility, which is challenging to obtain in such oxides. For this purpose, a series of bidentate ligands with azide termini and ethylene&#8208;glycol bridges is synthesized, and these ligands are universally applicable to the synthesis of a variety of dielectric and semiconductor oxides. Optimized photolithography conditions yield a high&#8208;quality ZrO2 dielectric film with a high dielectric constant and strength of &#8776;18 and &#8776;7 MV cm&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, this strategy is applied to semiconductor oxides such as In2O3 and ZnO, and the all&#8208;oxide&#8208;patterned solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) demonstrates a high charge carrier mobility of &#8776;40 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. An oxide TFT array is fully photopatterned on a 4&#8208;inch Si wafer; uniform performances are observed across these devices. This study suggests the possibility of realizing multifunctional oxides for application in advanced electronics using simple ligand exchange chemistry.

         <title>Tunable Interlayer Interactions in Exfoliated 2D van der Waals Framework Fe(SCN)2(Pyrazine)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial oxidation of 2D van der Waals frameworks causes their aggregation in solution, while remaining colloidally stable. Strong inter&#8208;sheet non&#8208;covalent interactions give rise to intense, broad&#8208;band visible light absorption. The absorption intensity, bandshape, and energy of this inter&#8208;sheet absorption band is highly tunable by controlling solvent and framework identity.








Abstract
2D materials can be isolated as monolayer sheets when interlayer interactions involve weak van der Waals forces. These atomically thin structures enable novel topological physics and open chemical questions of how to tune the structure and properties of the sheets while maintaining them as isolated monolayers. Here, this work investigates 2D electroactive sheets that exfoliate in solution into colloidal nanosheets, but aggregate upon oxidation, giving rise to tunable interlayer charge transfer absorption and photoluminescence. This optical behavior resembles interlayer excitons, now intensely studied due to their long&#8208;lived emission, but which remain difficult to tune through synthetic chemistry. Instead, the interlayer excitons of these framework sheets can be modulated through control of solvent, electrolyte, oxidation state, and the composition of the framework building blocks. Compared to other 2D materials, these framework sheets display the largest known interlayer binding strengths, attributable to specific orbital interactions between the sheets, and among the longest interlayer exciton lifetimes. Taken together, this study provides a microscopic basis for manipulating long&#8208;range opto&#8208;electronic behavior in van der Waals materials through molecular synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Flexible Neural Interface From Non&#8208;Transient Silk Fibroin With Outstanding Conformality, Biocompatibility, and Bioelectric Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the interactions between silk fibroin (SF) and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a robust and intertwined SF/PEDOT interface can be established. Leveraging this approach, a non&#8208;transient SF&#8208;based neural interface that possesses outstanding stability, conformality, biocompatibility, and bioelectric conductivity is developed. These features make it an ideal platform for the recording and monitoring of neural activities.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) with good biocompatibility can enable an efficient and safe implementation of neural interfaces. However, it has been difficult to achieve a robust integration of patterned conducting materials (multichannel electrodes) on flexible SF film substrates due to the absence of some enduring interactions. In this study, a thermo&#8208;assisted pattern&#8208;transfer technique is demonstrated that can facilely transfer a layer of pre&#8208;set poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) onto the flexible SF substrate through an interpenetrating network of 2 polymer chains, achieving a desired substrate/conductor intertwined interface with good flexibility (&#8776;33&#160;MPa), conductivity (386&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and stability in liquid state over 4 months simultaneously. Importantly, this technique can be combined with ink&#8208;jet printing to prepare a multichannel SF&#8208;based neural interface for the electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording and inflammation remission in rat models. The SF&#8208;based neural interface with satisfied tissue conformability, biocompatibility, and bioelectric conductivity is a promising ECoG acquisition tool, where the demonstrated approach can also be useful to develop other SF&#8208;based flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Customization of 2D Atomic&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction with Manipulatable Charge&#8208;Transfer and Band Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined atomic&#8208;molecular heterojunction strategy is developed featuring strong covalent bonds between organic molecule and 2D violet phosphorus atomic crystal, enabling enhanced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics and customizable band structure regulation at the molecular level. Our research provides a low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;efficiency regulatory approach to optimize device performance across diverse application domains.








Abstract
Manipulating the properties of 2D&#160;materials through meticulously engineered artificial heterojunctions holds great promise for novel device applications. However, existing research on the crucial charge&#8208;transfer interactions and energy profile regulation is predominantly focused on 2D van der Waals structures formed via weak van der Waals forces, limiting regulatory efficiency at high costs. Herein, a refined atomic&#8208;molecular heterojunction strategy featuring strong covalent bonds between organic molecule and 2D violet phosphorus (VP) atomic crystal is developed, which enables enhanced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics and customizable band structure regulation at the molecular level. Both experimentally and theoretically, it is demonstrated that grafting efficiency, charge redistribution, and energy gap regulation critically depend on organic electronegativity, providing a low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;efficiency regulatory effect on a large scale. As a proof of concept, the novel VP&#8208;molecular heterojunctions exhibit optimized performance in diverse application domains, presenting a general platform for future high&#8208;performance device applications.

         <title>Constructing a Janus Catholyte/Cathode Structure: A New Strategy for Stable Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by membrane&#8208;less organelles in cells, a simple and versatile strategy is proposed&#8212;constructing a Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrode based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, in which redox&#8208;active organic molecules are confined in the liquid state within the activated carbon, thereby eliminating the volume effect and preventing their diffusion into the electrolyte.








Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for the electrodes of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries due to their nonmetallic nature, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they often suffer from significant dissolution during the charge&#8208;discharge process, which poses a major hurdle to their practical applications. Inspired by membrane&#8208;less organelles in cells, a simple and versatile strategy is proposed&#8212;constructing a Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrode based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, in which redox&#8208;active organic molecules are confined in the liquid state within the activated carbon, thereby eliminating the volume effect and preventing their diffusion into the electrolyte. The customization of phase separation systems by leveraging the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity differences of various anions is successfully demonstrated. This approach allows for precise regulation of ion cluster/coordination structures, enabling the confinement of active substances while ensuring efficient ion transport. Consequently, the as&#8208;constructed Zn||Janus catholyte/cathode cells exhibit superior reversible rate capacity (186&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and remarkable cycling performance (retention of 72.5% after 12&#160;000 cycles). The strategy in building Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrodes breaks free from the limitations imposed by traditional solid&#8208;state electrodes, offering tremendous opportunities for exploring diverse advanced battery systems.

         <title>Programming Hydrogen Bonds for Reversible Elastic&#8208;Plastic Phase Transition in a Conductive Stretchable Hydrogel Actuator with Rapid Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Density Energy Conversion and Multiple Sensory Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the energy conversion of hairspring, an intelligent hydrogel is developed to achieve reversible transformation between elasticity and plasticity through precise regulation of hydrogen bonds, enabling efficient energy storage and release. The hydrogel exhibits exceptional drive rate, high energy density output, and diversified sensing capability. This groundbreaking innovation paves the way for novel designs of smart hydrogel actuators.








Abstract
Smart hydrogels have recently garnered significant attention in the fields of actuators, human&#8208;machine interaction, and soft robotics. However, when constructing large&#8208;scale actuated systems, they usually exhibit limited actuation forces (&#8776;2&#160;kPa) and actuation speeds. Drawing inspiration from hairspring energy conversion mechanism, an elasticity&#8208;plasticity&#8208;controllable composite hydrogel (PCTA) with robust contraction capabilities is developed. By precisely manipulating intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the material's elasticity and plasticity can be programmed to facilitate efficient energy storage and release. The proposed mechanism enables rapid generation of high contraction forces (900&#160;kPa) at ultra&#8208;high working densities (0.96&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that modifications in the number and nature of hydrogen bonds lead to a distinct elastic&#8208;plastic transition in hydrogels. Furthermore, the conductive PCTA hydrogel exhibits multimodal sensing capabilities including stretchable strain sensing with a wide sensing range (1&#8211;200%), fast response time (180&#160;ms), and excellent linearity of the output signal. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional temperature and humidity sensing capabilities with high detection accuracy. The strong actuation power and real&#8208;time sensory feedback from the composite hydrogels are expected to inspire novel flexible driving materials and intelligent sensing systems.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Narrow&#8208;Band Deep&#8208;Red Electroluminescence By a Soliton&#8208;type Dye Squaraine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaraine dyes typically exhibit narrow emission spectra due to their soliton&#8208;like electronic structure characteristics. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on soliton&#8208;type squaraine dye is prepared, overcoming the luminescence quenching induced by dye aggregation. The deep&#8208;red electroluminescence peak is located at 668&#160;nm, with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 0.10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Due to the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics, cyanine dyes typically exhibit spectral behaviors such as large molar extinction coefficients, narrow spectra, and high fluorescence efficiency. However, their extensive applications as emitters in electroluminescence are largely ignored due to their serious emission quenching in the aggregation state. Herein, it is reported a squaraine dye (a type of cyanine) SQPhEt. At different solution concentrations, the unusual decrease in full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) with increasing Stokes shift indicates the fluorescence quenching of SQPhEt in the aggregated state is because of the strong self&#8208;absorption effect. A sensitized device structure can help to reduce the doping concentration of dye, which can effectively suppress self&#8208;absorption. Benefitting from the large molar extinction coefficient of SQPhEt, even at low doping concentrations of 0.1 wt%, efficient F&#246;rster energy transfer can be achieved. The corresponding spin&#8208;coating sensitized device based on SQPhEt as the dopant exhibits favorable deep&#8208;red emission at 668&#160;nm with a small FWHM of 0.10&#160;eV.

         <title>Unveiling the Cation Dependence in Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution by Differently&#8208;Charged Ruthenium/Molybdenum Sulfide Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics via water reduction limits the water electrolysis efficiency and depends on both catalyst structures and electrolyte cations. Herein, by hybridizing metallic Ru with differently&#8208;charged MoSx clusters, the interrelated effect of metal valence and charged support for the cation&#8208;dependent hydrogen evolution activity is demonstrated, in which the metal valence determines the water activation capability and the support determines the cation accumulation.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via water reduction limits the efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The HER kinetics is not only intimately related to the catalyst surface structure but also relevant to the cation identity of the electrolyte. The cation dependence also relies on the surface electronic structure and applied potential, but this interrelated effect and its underlying mechanism awaits elucidation. Herein, differently&#8208;charged molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) cluster supports ([Mo3S13]2&#8722; and [Mo3S7]4+) are utilized to hybridize with the identical metallic Ru centers. The specific electrostatic interaction between MoSx clusters and Ru precursors induces different Ru valences of the hybrids, with a higher valence state for Ru/Mo3S13 endowing a higher activity. The Ru/Mo3S13 and Ru/Mo3S7 exhibited drastically&#8208;different cation dependence, in which the charged support determines the local accumulation of cations and resulting water structures. The more negatively&#8208;charged Mo3S13 support induces the facile accumulation of cations, especially for less&#8208;hydrated K+ cations. The water activation capability by Ru valences and cation accumulation from the support effect in&#8208;together determine the cation&#8208;dependent alkaline HER activity. This work not only enriches the understanding about the cation&#8208;dependent HER mechanism but also shines a light on the rational optimization strategy of electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

This novel approach enhances device performance, achieving a peak external quantum efficiency of 16.4%, a peak luminance of 269&#160;455&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a half&#8208;life of 462&#160;690&#160;h at 100&#160;nit, paving the way for more efficient and stable next&#8208;generation displays.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dot (QD)&#8211;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) have reached the pinnacle of quantum efficiency and are now being actively developed for next&#8208;generation displays and brighter light sources. Previous research has suggested utilizing inorganic hole&#8208;transport layers (HTLs) to explore brighter and more stable QD&#8208;LEDs. However, the performance metrics of such QD&#8208;LEDs with inorganic HTLs generally lag behind those of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid QD&#8208;LEDs employing organic HTLs. In this study, colloidal NiMgO nanocrystals (NCs) with spatially controlled Mg are introduced as HTLs for realizing efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic QD&#8208;LEDs. During the co&#8208;condensation of Ni and Mg precursors to produce valence band&#8208;lowered NiMgO NCs, incorporating &#8776;2% Mg into the NiO lattice creates additional Ni vacancies (VNi) within and on the NCs, influencing the hole concentration and mobility of the NiMgO NC films. Passivating the VNi exposed on the surface with magnesium hydroxide allows for tuning the electrical properties of the NiMgO NCs relative to those of an electron transport layer, allowing for a balanced charge supply and suppressed negative charging of the QDs. Optimized all&#8208;inorganic QD&#8208;LEDs employing NiMgO NCs achieved a peak external quantum efficiency of 16.4%, peak luminance of 269&#160;455&#160;cd&#160;m&#8315;2, and a half&#8208;life of 462&#160;690&#160;h at 100&#160;nit.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry Van der Waals Dielectric GaInS3 Triggered 2D MoS2 Giant Anisotropy via Symmetry Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;symmetry dielectrics GaInS3 sparks MoS2 obvious anisotropy, at the inface of MoS2/GaInS3 heterojunction. The anisotropic optical responses are confirmed through polarized Raman and PL spectra. Under dual&#8208;gate modulation, MoS2 FET demonstrates highly adjustable anisotropic conductivity up to 106. Remarkably, the GaInS3&#8208;gated MoS2 photodetector exhibits a large dichroic ratio (&#8776;167), which greatly promotes its application in polarized photodetection.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry structures in van der Waals materials have facilitated the advancement of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the intrinsic low symmetry structure exhibits a small adjustable anisotropy ratio (1&#8211;10), which hinders its further assembly and processing into high&#8208;performance devices. Here, a novel 2D anisotropic dielectric, GaInS3 (GIS), which induces isotropic MoS2 to exhibit significant anisotropic optical and electrical responses is demonstrated. With the excellent gate modulation ability of 2D GIS (dielectric constant k &#8764;12), MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows an adjustable conductance ratio from isotropic to anisotropic under dual&#8208;gate modulation, up to 106. Theoretical calculations indicate that anisotropy originates from lattice mismatch&#8208;induced charge density deformation at the interface. Moreover, the MoS2/GIS photodetector demonstrates high responsivity (&#8776;4750 A W&#8722;1) and a large dichroic ratio (&#8776;167). The anisotropic van der Waals dielectric GIS paves the way for the development of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in the fields of anisotropic photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics.

         <title>WS2 Moir&#233; Superlattices Supporting Au Nanoclusters and Isolated Ru to Boost Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maximizing the catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom and nanocluster catalysts is essential for their industrial application in water&#8208;alkali electrolyzers. A bilayer WS2 moir&#233; superlattices are reported that support Au nanoclusters and Ru single atoms (Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2) to enhance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Experiments and theories indicate that the improved HER activity stems from strong metal&#8211;support interactions in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2, promoting charge redistribution in the catalyst.








Abstract
Maximizing the catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom and nanocluster catalysts through the modulation of the interaction between these components and the corresponding supports is crucial but challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, a nanoporous bilayer WS2 Moir&#233; superlattices (MSLs) supported Au nanoclusters (NCs) adjacent to Ru single atoms (SAs) (Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2) is developed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the first time. Theoretical analysis suggests that the induced robust electronic metal&#8211;support interaction effect in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 is prone to promote the charge redistribution among Ru SAs, Au NCs, and WS2 MSLs support, which is beneficial to reduce the energy barrier for water adsorption and thus promoting the subsequent H2 formation. As feedback, the well&#8208;designed Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding HER performance with high activity (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;19&#160;mV), low Tafel slope (35&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and excellent long&#8208;term stability. Further, in situ, experimental studies reveal that the reconstruction of Ru SAs/NCs with S vacancies in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 structure acts as the main catalytically active center, while high&#8208;valence Au NCs are responsible for activating and stabilizing Ru sites to prevent the dissolution and deactivation of active sites. This work offers guidelines for the rational design of high&#8208;performance atomic&#8208;scale electrocatalysts.

         <title>Hybrid Anapole Induced Chirality in Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface that induces hybrid anapole (HA) for achieving chiro&#8208;optical responses. By breaking the structural symmetry, the metasurface supports both first&#8208;order and pseudo higher&#8208;order HA, leading to enhanced circular dichroism and polarization control. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental study of anapole physics and have significant implications for nanophotonics applications.








Abstract
The interaction between light and matter, particularly chirality, plays a pivotal role in modern science and technology. Typically, metasurfaces achieve chiro&#8208;optical effects by coupling electric and magnetic dipoles in specific orientations. In this work, the design and optimization of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface is explored to induce hybrid anapole (HA) for optical activity. When the symmetry of the metasurface structure is disrupted, the design can simultaneously excite first&#8208;order and pseudo high&#8208;order HA under illumination with a specific circular polarization, both occurring within the same spectral regime. This results in high reflection for one circular polarization and a significant reduction in reflection for the orthogonal polarization, thereby exhibiting exceptional chiro&#8208;optical activity. Moreover, the HA&#8208;based chiral metasurface demonstrates strong polarization control capabilities, as verified by Stokes parameter analysis, revealing high birefringence and a pronounced dependence on the incident polarization angle. These results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of HA metasurfaces for advanced optical applications and polarization control, paving the way for new developments in chiral nanophotonics.

This work presents a generalizable approach for the on&#8208;chip synthesis of non&#8208;layered, nanometer&#8208;thick, quasi&#8208;2D semimetals from multi&#8208;layer chalcogenides. In the exemplary case, sub&#8208;20&#160;nm semiconducting InSe with nickel deposited on top are subjected to a low&#8208;temperature annealing step. This process enables a controlled transformation of the layered InSe into non&#8208;layered, crystalline Kagome&#8208;semimetal Ni3In2Se2 via reaction with the laterally diffusing nickel.








Abstract
Reducing the dimensions of materials from three to two, or quasi&#8208;two, provides a fertile platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena and developing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, growing high&#8208;quality, ultrathin, quasi2D materials in a templated fashion on an arbitrary substrate is challenging. Here, the study demonstrates a simple and reproducible on&#8208;chip approach for synthesizing non&#8208;layered, nanometer&#8208;thick, quasi&#8208;2D semimetals. In one implementation, this method starts with thin semiconducting InSe flakes of below 20&#160;nm in thickness with nickel deposited on top, followed by a low&#8208;temperature annealing step that results in a controlled transformation of the layered InSe to a non&#8208;layered, crystalline semimetal via reaction with the laterally diffusing nickel. Atomic resolution microscopy reveals the transformed semimetal to be Ni3In2Se2 with a Kagome&#8208;lattice structure. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this synthesis method is generalizable by transforming 2D layered chalcogenides such as SnS and SnSe employing Ni and Co to non&#8208;layered semimetals, paving the way for engineering novel types of devices.

         <title>Grain Boundary Filling Empowers (002)&#8208;Textured Zn Metal Anodes with Superior Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundary wetting strategy is demonstrated to completely fill the Zn grain boundaries, while simultaneously converting the initial random&#8208;textured Zn into a single (002)&#8208;textured Zn. Using In as the boundary filler, the as&#8208;received intercrystalline&#8208;modified (002)&#8208;textured Zn (IM(002) Zn) ensures homogeneous epitaxial Zn deposition and significantly mitigates the intergranular issues, resulting in excellent reversibility in various battery configurations.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn battery is promising for grid&#8208;level energy storage due to its high safety and low cost, but dendrite growth and side reactions at the Zn metal anode hinder its development. Designing Zn with (002) orientation improves the stability of the Zn anode, yet grain boundaries remain susceptible to corrosion and dendrite growth. Addressing these intergranular issues is crucial for enhancing the electrochemical performance of (002)&#8208;textured Zn. Here, a strategy based on grain boundary wetting to fill intergranular regions and mitigate these issues is reported. By systematically investigating boundary fillers and filling conditions, In metal is chosen as the filler, and one&#8208;step annealing is used to synergistically convert commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn while filling In into the boundaries. The inter&#8208;crystalline&#8208;modified (002)&#8208;textured Zn (IM(002) Zn) effectively inhibits corrosion and dendrite growth, resulting in excellent stability in batteries. This work offers new insights into Zn anode protection and the development of high&#8208;energy Zn batteries.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Gelation of Graphene Oxide Dispersions via Mild Thermal Annealing: Implications for 3D Printing and Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild thermal annealing (MTA) process transforms graphene oxide (GO) into an additive&#8208;free gel, significantly enhancing its rheological properties. SAXS experiments reveal the microstructural changes during MTA. The graphitic domains developed through MTA promote hydrophobic attractions, inducing a network structure. Through 3D&#8208;printing and electrochemical experiments, MTA demonstrates potential as an optimal gelation method for GO.








Abstract
Herein, a mild thermal annealing (MTA) process is presented for additive&#8208;free gelation of graphene oxide (GO) dispersions. This process transitions the GO from a nematic liquid crystal phase to a random network structure, significantly enhancing its rheological properties by order of magnitude. This transition is facilitated by the diffusion of functional groups on the GO surface, which induces hydrophobic attractions, leading to a stable network structure. Employing rheo&#8208;SAXS experiments, detailed insights are provided into the microstructural changes of GO gel under shear stress, establishing a direct correlation between its rheological behavior and microstructure. The distinctive properties of MTA&#8208;processed inks are illustrated, seamlessly integrating with 3D printing, to yield a highly porous lattice structure that demonstrates promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode. The MTA process, an additive&#8208;free approach to gelation, maintains the inherent dispersion properties of GO while offering scalability. Thus, this method brings significant economic and environmental advantages compared to conventional gelation techniques. The findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of 2D colloidal network gels but also increase the potential of GO for a wide range of applications, from gas and liquid absorbers to electrodes for energy storage and conversion, and biomedical fields.

         <title>Sustainable Nanofibril Interfaces for Strain&#8208;Resilient and Multimodal Porous Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, soft bioelectronics are breathable and offer long&#8208;term biocompatibility, but face challenges in stability under stretching and sweat management. This study uses cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) as interfaces to improve strain resilience and printing quality on porous substrates. In addition, CNF&#8208;based microfluidics enables continuous sweat monitoring, resulting in a multimodal bioelectronic system for tracking energy metabolism and consumption.








Abstract
Porous soft bioelectronics have attracted significant attention due to their high breathability, long&#8208;term biocompatibility, and other unique features inaccessible in nonporous counterparts. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality multimodal bioelectronic components that operate stably under strain on porous substrates, along with integrating microfluidics for sweat management, remains challenging. In this study, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) are explored, biomass&#8208;derived sustainable biomaterials, as nanofibril interfaces with unprecedented interfacial robustness to enable high&#8208;quality printing of strain&#8208;resilient bioelectronics on porous substrates by reducing surface roughness and creating mechanical heterogeneity. Also, CNF&#8208;based microfluidics can provide continuous sweat collection and refreshment, crucial for accurate biochemical sensing. Building upon these advancements, a multimodal porous wearable bioelectronic system is further developed capable of simultaneously detecting electrocardiograms and glucose and beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate in sweat for monitoring energy metabolism and consumption. This work introduces novel strategies for fabricating high&#8208;quality, strain&#8208;resilient porous bioelectronics with customizable multimodalities to meet arising personalized healthcare needs.

         <title>Unlocking Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Through Ru&#8211;Sn Dual Metal Sites and a Novel Hydroxyl Spillover Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS electrocatalyst, with optimized Ru&#8211;Sn sites for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption and SnO2&#8208;induced unique hydroxyl spillover, enhances the alkaline hydrogen evolution by accelerating hydroxyl transfer and protecting active sites.








Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production but is still limited by the lack of active and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the efficient water dissociation process, fast transfer of adsorbed hydroxyl and optimized hydrogen adsorption are first achieved on a cooperative electrocatalyst, named as Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS, in which the Ru&#8211;Sn dual metal sites and SnO2 heterojunction are constructed based on porous Ru nanosheet. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ infrared spectra suggest that Ru&#8211;Sn dual sites can optimize the water dissociation process and hydrogen adsorption, while the existence of SnO2 can induce the unique hydroxyl spillover effect, accelerating the hydroxyl transfer process and avoiding the poison of active sites. As results, Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS display remarkable alkaline HER performance with an extremely low overpotential (12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and robust stability (650&#160;h), much superior to those of Ru NS (27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 90&#160;h stability) and Ru&#8211;Sn NS (16&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 120&#160;h stability). The work sheds new light on designing of efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst.

As results, Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NS display remarkable alkaline HER performance with an extremely low overpotential (12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and robust stability (650&#160;h), much superior to those of Ru NS (27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 90&#160;h stability) and Ru&#8211;Sn NS (16&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 120&#160;h stability). The work sheds new light on designing of efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Silole Hole Transport Layer for Efficient and Stable Lead&#8211;Tin Perovskite and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional hole transport material (HTM) PEDOT: PSS is a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability in Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work offers an alternative means toward efficient and stable Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs using a new multi&#8208;functional HTM Silole&#8208;COOH, demonstrating 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems while avoiding the stability concerns associated with PEDOT: PSS.








Abstract
Despite high theoretical efficiencies and rapid improvements in performance, high&#8208;efficiency &#8776;1.2&#160;eV mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generally rely on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL); a material that is considered to be a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability due to its acidity and hygroscopic nature. Seeking to replace PEDOT: PSS with an alternative HTL with improved atmospheric and thermal stability, herein, a silole derivative (Silole&#8208;COOH) tuned with optimal electronic properties and efficient carrier transport by incorporating a carboxyl functional group is designed, which results in an optimal band alignment for hole extraction from Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and robust air and thermal stability. Thin films composed of the Silole&#8208;COOH exhibit superior conductivity and carrier mobility compared to PEDOT: PSS, in addition to reduced nonradiative quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting losses at the HTL/perovskite interface and improved quality of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. Replacement of PEDOT: PSS with Silole&#8208;COOH leads to 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems, and long operating stability in ambient air.

         <title>Unveiling Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Methane at the Ceria/Gas Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study clarifies methane electro&#8208;oxidation process on ceria surfaces using Sm&#8208;doped ceria (SDC) model thin&#8208;film electrochemical cells, integrating impedance spectroscopy, operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. It presents definitive answers regarding ceria's electrocatalytic activity and reaction rate&#8208;limiting steps, significantly contributing to the advancement of efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral fuel utilization in high&#8208;temperature solid oxide fuel cells.








Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stand out in sustainable energy systems for their unique ability to efficiently utilize hydrocarbon fuels, particularly those from carbon&#8208;neutral sources. CeO2&#8722;&#948; (ceria) based oxides embedded in SOFCs are recognized for their critical role in managing hydrocarbon activation and carbon coking. However, even for the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, CH4, the mechanism of electrochemical oxidation at the ceria/gas interface is not well understood and the capability of ceria to electrochemically oxidize methane remains a topic of debate. This lack of clarity stems from the intricate design of standard metal/oxide composite electrodes and the complex nature of electrode reactions involving multiple chemical and electrochemical steps. This study presents a Sm&#8208;doped ceria thin&#8208;film model cell that selectively monitors CH4 direct&#8208;electro&#8208;oxidation on the ceria surface. Using impedance spectroscopy, operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory, it is unveiled that ceria surfaces facilitate C&#9472;H bond cleavage and that H2O formation is key in determining the overall reaction rate at the electrode. These insights effectively address the longstanding debate regarding the direct utilization of CH4 in SOFCs. Moreover, these findings pave the way for an optimized electrode design strategy, essential for developing high&#8208;performance, environmentally sustainable fuel cells.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste to Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach without the need for additional catalysts or solvents for the upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste is reported. Specifically, bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acids are found to directly convert PET bottles into biodegradable copolyesters suitable for agricultural mulch films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the large&#8208;scale upgrading and reprocessing of PET waste.








Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with annual output second only to polyethylene. Due to its low biodegradability, a large amount of PET is recycled for sustainable development. However, current strategies for PET recycling are limited by low added value or small product scale. It is urgent to make a breakthrough on the principle of PET macromolecular reaction and efficiently prepare products with high added value and wide applications. Here, the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free synthesis of biodegradable plastics are reported through novel carboxyl&#8208;ester transesterification between PET waste and bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acid (HDA), which can directly substitute some terephthalic acid (TPA) units in PET chain by HDA unit. This macromolecular reaction can be facilely carried out on current equipment in the polyester industry without any additional catalyst and solvent, thus enabling low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale production. Furthermore, the product semi&#8208;bio&#8208;based copolyester shows excellent mechanical properties, regulable flexibility and good biodegradability, which is expected to substitute poly(butylene adipate&#8208;co&#8208;terephthalate) (PBAT) plastic as high value&#8208;added biodegradable materials. This work provides an environmental&#8208;friendly and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste.

         <title>Real Topological Phonons in 3D Carbon Allotropes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings indicate that among the 1661 3D carbon allotropes in the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA), 79 possess a phononic real Chern insulating (PRCI) state, 2 possess a phononic real nodal line (PRNL) state, 12 possess a phononic real Dirac point (PRDP) state, and 10 possess a phononic real triple&#8208;point pair (PRTPP) state, respectively. The real topology of PRCI, PRNL, PRDP, and PRTTP states in 3D carbon allotropes is manifested in the second&#8208;order phononic hinge states.








Abstract
There has been a significant focus on real topological systems that enjoy space&#8208;time inversion symmetry and lack spin&#8208;orbit coupling. While the theoretical classification of the real topology has been established, more progress has yet to be made in the materials realization of real topological phononic states in 3D. To address this crucial issue, high&#8208;throughput computing is performed to inspect the real topology in the phonon spectrums of the 3D carbon allotropes. Among 1661 carbon allotropes listed in the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA), 79 candidates host a phononic real Chern insulating (PRCI) state, 2 candidates host a phononic real nodal line (PRNL) state, 12 candidates host a phononic real Dirac point (PRDP) state, and 10 candidates host a phononic real triple&#8208;point pair (PRTPP) state. The PRCI, PRNL, PRTPP, and PRDP states of 27&#8208;SG. 166&#8208;pcu&#8208;h, 1081&#8208;SG. 194&#8208;42T13&#8208;CA, 52&#8208;SG. 141&#8208;gis, and 132&#8208;SG. 191&#8208;3,4T157 are exhibited as illustrative examples, and the second&#8208;order phononic hinge modes are explored. This study broadens the understanding of 3D topological phonons and expands the material candidates with phononic hinge modes and phononic real&#160;topology.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Micro&#8208;Nanostructured Electron Transport Layer via Bubble&#8208;Assisted Assembly for Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unbalanced diffusion lengths of photogenerated electrons and holes in formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite materials facilitate the charge recombination. Here, ordered SnO2 micro&#8208;nanoarrays are constructed by a bubble&#8208;assisted printing method and serve as &#8220;speedway&#8221; for electron transport in perovskite photovoltaics. Perovskite layers embedded with SnO2 arrays result in reduced charge recombination and improved power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention in photovoltaic research, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and cost&#8208;effective manufacturing techniques. However, the unbalanced charge carrier diffusion length in perovskite materials leads to the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The inefficient charge carrier collecting process severely affects the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs. Herein, a solution&#8208;processed SnO2 array electron transport layer with precisely tunable micro&#8208;nanostructures is fabricated via a bubble&#8208;template&#8208;assisted approach, serving as both electron transport layers and scaffolds for the perovskite layer. Due to the optimized electron transporting pathway and enlarged perovskite grain size, the PSCs achieve a PCE of 25.35% (25.07% certificated PCE).

         <title>Untethered &amp; Stiffness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetic Liquid Robots for Cleaning Thrombus in Complex Blood Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a ferromagnetic liquid robot (FMLR) with tunable modulus (0.1&#8211;2018&#160;Pa) applied to thrombus removal in complex blood vessels is developed. Besides, in medical robotic applications, FMLR can be used in telerobotic neurointerventional. This study introduces an efficient approach for thrombus elimination, broadening the utilization of FMLRs within the realm of clinical medicine.








Abstract
Thrombosis is a significant threat to human health. However, the existing clinical treatment methods have limitations. Magnetic soft matter is used in the biomedical field for years, and ferromagnetic liquids exhibit tunable stiffness and on&#8208;demand movement advantages under magnetic fields. In this study, a ferromagnetic liquid robot (FMLR) is developed and applied it to thrombus removal in complex blood vessels. The FMLR consisted of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and dimethyl silicone oil. The FMLR can pass through a narrow complex maze through shape deformation by tailoring the intensity and direction of the external magnetic field. Finite element simulation analysis is used to validate the mechanism of controllable FMLR movements. Importantly, the storage modulus of FMLR can be tuned from 0.1 to 2018&#160;Pa by varying the external magnetic intensity, ensuring its effectiveness in removing rigid and stubborn thrombi present on the vascular walls. Toward medical robotic applications, FMLR can be used in telerobotic neurointerventional. Experiments demonstrating the capability of FMLR to remove thrombi in the ear veins of rabbits are conducted. This study introduces an efficient approach for thrombus elimination, broadening the utilization of FMLRs within the realm of clinical medicine.

         <title>Universal Ensemble&#8208;Embedding Graph Neural Network for Direct Prediction of Optical Spectra from Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces GNNOpt, an equivariant graph&#8208;neural&#8208;network architecture incorporating universal embedding with automatic optimization. GNNOpt allows for precise prediction of optical spectra based exclusively on crystal structures and can be up to a million times faster than traditional first&#8208;principles calculations. Consequently, GNNOpt can significantly speed up the development of photovoltaic and quantum materials.








Abstract
Optical properties in solids, such as refractive index and absorption, hold vast applications ranging from solar panels to sensors, photodetectors, and transparent displays. However, first&#8208;principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, Graph Neural Network for Optical spectra prediction (GNNOpt) is introduced, an equivariant graph&#8208;neural&#8208;network architecture featuring universal embedding with automatic optimization. This enables high&#8208;quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers&#8208;Kr&#246;nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. The trained model is applied to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First&#8208;principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs, which host exotic quasiparticles with multifold nontrivial topology, demonstrates the potential of GNNOpt in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and&#160;applications.

         <title>Innovative In Situ Passivation Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
10.81%&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell is achieved using an in situ passivation technique, which involves incorporating sodium selenosulfate to the precursor solution, effectively passivates deep&#8208;level intrinsic defects, enhances film quality, and reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination.








Abstract
An effective defect passivation strategy is crucial for enhancing the performance of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, as it significantly influences charge transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, a convenient and novel in situ passivation (ISP) technique is successfully introduced to enhance the performance of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, achieving a champion efficiency of 10.81%, which is among the highest recorded for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells to date. The first principles calculations and the experimental data reveal that incorporating sodium selenosulfate in the ISP strategy effectively functions as an in situ selenization, effectively passivating deep&#8208;level cation antisite SbSe defect within the Sb2(S,Se)3 films and significantly suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination in the devices. Space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited current (SCLC), photoluminescence (PL), and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements verify the high quality of the passivated films, showing fewer traps and defects. Moreover, the ISP strategy improved the overall quality of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films, and fine&#8208;tuned the energy levels, thereby facilitating enhanced carrier transport. This study thus provides a straightforward and effective method for passivating deep&#8208;level defects in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

         <title>De&#8208;Passivation and Surface Crystal Plane Reconstruction via Chemical Polishing for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemically polished Zn metal anode (CP&#8208;Zn), achieved through a facile immersion method, effectively removes passivation layers and selectively exposes (002) crystal planes. This process ensures uniform zinc deposition and improved cell stability, demonstrated by over 4600 hours of stable cycling in symmetric cells and high capacity retention in full cells.








Abstract
Despite the widespread adoption of Zn anodes for aqueous energy storage, the presence of an inherent passivation layer and the polycrystalline interface of commercial Zn foil consistently lead to non&#8208;uniform electrodeposition, undermining stability and practicality. Herein, the study introduces a chemically polished Zn metal anode (CP&#8208;Zn) fabricated via a simple immersion method. This &#8220;chemically polishing&#8221; process can effectively remove the interfacial passivation layer (de&#8208;passivation), providing ample active sites for plating/stripping and ensuring the uniformly distributed electric field and Zn2+ ion flux. Additionally, selective etching during chemical polishing exposes more (002) crystal planes, promoting homogeneous and smooth zinc deposition while suppressing related side reactions. Demonstrated by CP&#8208;Zn anode, the symmetric cell exhibits stable cycling over 4600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 240&#160;h at 50% depth of discharge (DOD), with a CP&#8208;Zn||VO2 full cell maintaining &#8776;75.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1. This chemically polishing strategy presents a promising avenue for advancing the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

Upcycling of Plastics
In the article number 2403728, Weipu Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an optimal approach without additional catalysts and solvents for the upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste. Specifically, bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acids are found to directly convert PET bottles into biodegradable copolyesters suitable for agricultural mulch films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste.

Volatile Organic Compounds
In article number 2409297, Shu Yang and co&#8208;workers present an innovative approach to enhance volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing by integrating dyes with colloidal photonic crystals. The broadened reflection peak allows for augmented dye absorption originating from the overlap between the photonic bandgap edge and the dye absorption peak, leading to a more noticeable color change discernible to the naked eye, eliminating the need for signal amplification.

         <title>Nanosonosensitizer Optimization for Enhanced Sonodynamic Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes, discusses, and highlights the latest optimization strategies for nanosonosensitizers in sonodynamic therapy, emphasizing their high potential for treating tumors, bacterial infections, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune disorders. This review also discusses the biosafety and biocompatibility of these nanosonosensitizers for guaranteeing the clinical translation, which further provides an overview of facing challenges and emerging opportunities in nanosonosensitizer&#8208;enabled sonodynamic therapy, aiming to promote its clinical implementation.








Abstract
Low&#8208;intensity ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which, by design, integrates sonosensitizers and molecular oxygen to generate therapeutic substances (e.g., toxic hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, or singlet oxygen) at disease sites, has shown enormous potential for the effective treatment of a variety of diseases. Nanoscale sonosensitizers play a crucial role in the SDT process because their structural, compositional, physicochemical, and biological characteristics are key determinants of therapeutic efficacy. In particular, advances in materials science and nanotechnology have invigorated a series of optimization strategies for augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of nanosonosensitizers. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes, discusses, and highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art studies on the current achievements of nanosonosensitizer optimization in enhanced sonodynamic disease treatment, with an emphasis on the general design principles of nanosonosensitizers and their optimization strategies, mainly including organic and inorganic nanosonosensitizers. Additionally, recent advancements in optimized nanosonosensitizers for therapeutic applications aimed at treating various diseases, such as cancer, bacterial infections, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune diseases, are clarified in detail. Furthermore, the biological effects of the improved nanosonosensitizers for versatile SDT applications are thoroughly discussed. The review concludes by highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly evolving research field to expedite its practical clinical translation and application.

         <title>Routes to Bidirectional Cathodes for Reversible Aprotic Alkali Metal&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 46, November 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the CO2 conversion reaction mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO2 conversion reaction kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship through calculation and experiment results, to provide routes to bidirectional cathodes for reversible aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO2 batteries and other gas batteries.








Abstract
Aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO2 batteries (AAMCBs) have garnered significant interest owing to fixing CO2 and providing large energy storage capacity. The practical implementation of AAMCBs is constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and the CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER). Because the CO2ER and CO2RR take place on the cathode, which connects the internal catalyst with the external environment. Building a bidirectional cathode with excellent CO2ER and CO2RR kinetics by optimizing the cathode's internal catalyst and environment has attracted most of the attention to improving the electrochemical performance of AAMCBs. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding. This review aims to give a route to bidirectional cathodes for reversible AAMCBs, by systematically discussing engineering strategies of both the internal catalyst (atomic, nanoscopic, and macroscopic levels) and the external environment (photo, photo&#8208;thermal, and force field). The CO2ER and CO2RR mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO2RR and CO2ER kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship are elucidated by combining computational and experimental approaches. This review establishes a fundamental understanding for designing bidirectional cathodes and gives a route for developing reversible AAMCBs and similar metal&#8211;gas battery systems.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates T cell receptor (TCR) clustering, a crucial process for immune signaling. Using engineered nanotools, the authors controlled TCR clustering in ligand&#8208;induced and ligand&#8208;free conditions. They found different dynamics of the two modalities, suggesting the importance of ligand size and architecture. This method offers precise control over receptor clustering, facilitating exploration of receptor activation.








Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. In this work, TCR clustering is controlled via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibit higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. This approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provides the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Percutaneous Delivery of Oncogel for Targeted Liver Tumor Ablation and Controlled Release of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable Oncogel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid, chemotherapy, and a checkpoint inhibitor for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation with long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone is developed. Intratumoral injection of OG can potentially augment immunotherapy and improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.








Abstract
Advanced&#8208;stage liver cancers are associated with poor prognosis and have limited treatment options, often leading the patient to hospice care. Percutaneous intratumoral injection of anticancer agents has emerged as a potential alternative to systemic therapy to overcome tumor barriers, increase bioavailability, potentiate immunotherapy, and avoid systemic toxicity, which advanced&#8208;stage cancer patients cannot tolerate. Here, an injectable OncoGel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid (IL) is developed for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation and long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone. Rigorous mechanical, physiochemical, drug release, cytotoxicity experiments, and ex vivo human tissue testing identify an injectable version of the OG with bactericidal properties against highly resistant bacteria. Intratumoral injection of OG loaded with Nivolumab (Nivo) and doxorubicin (Dox) into highly malignant tumor models in mice, rats, and rabbits demonstrates enhanced survival and tumor regression associated with robust tissue ablation and drug distribution throughout the tumor. Mass cytometry and proteomic studies in a mouse model of colorectal cancer that often metastasizes to the liver indicate an enhanced anticancer immune response following the intratumoral injection of OG. OG may augment immunotherapy and potentially improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.

         <title>Janus Swarm Metamaterials for Information Display, Memory, and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoactive Janus particles (MAJPs) with engineered functional compartments provide tunable structures and properties that enable fast swarming response, remote actuation, and advanced functions in electronics&#8208;free configurations. MAJPs are implemented in swarm metamaterials with programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices.








Abstract
Metamaterials are emerging as an unconventional platform to perform computing abstractions in physical systems by processing environmental stimuli into information. While computation functions have been demonstrated in mechanical systems, they rely on compliant mechanisms to achieve predefined states, which impose inherent design restrictions that limit their miniaturization, deployment, reconfigurability, and functionality. Here, a metamaterial system is described based on responsive magnetoactive Janus particle (MAJP) swarms with multiple programmable functions. MAJPs are designed with tunable structure and properties in mind, that is, encoded swarming behavior and fully reversible switching mechanisms, to enable programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices. MAJPs and their unique swarming behavior open new functions for the design of multifunctional and reconfigurable display devices, and constitute a promising building block to develop the next generation of soft physical computing devices, with growing applications in security, defense, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, camouflage, soft robotics, and human&#8208;robot interaction.

         <title>Flexible Crossbar Molecular Devices with Patterned EGaIn Top Electrodes for Integrated All&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Circuit Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the design of flexible molecular devices is presented here. The devices with patterned liquid metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes exhibit excellent charge transport performance and stable retention properties. Functional all&#8208;molecule&#8208;circuits including Boolean logic gates and rectifier circuits are achieved by the devices.








Abstract
Here, a unique crossbar architecture is designed and fabricated, incorporating vertically integrated self&#8208;assembled monolayers in electronic devices. This architecture is used to showcase 100 individual vertical molecular junctions on a single chip with a high yield of working junctions and high device uniformity. The study introduces a transfer approach for patterned liquid&#8208;metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes, enabling the creation of fully flexible molecular devices with electrical functionalities. The devices exhibit excellent charge transport performance, sustain a high rectification ratio (&gt;103), and stable endurance and retention properties, even when the devices are significantly bent. Furthermore, Boolean logic gates, including OR and AND gates, as well as half&#8208;wave and full&#8208;wave rectifying circuits, are successfully implemented. The unique design of the flexible molecular device represents a significant step in harnessing the potential of molecular devices for high&#8208;density integration and possible molecule&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Robust Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings for Self&#8208;Activating and Sustainable Biofouling Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;dispense&#8208;then&#8208;kill&#8221; anti&#8208;biofouling strategy is developed via copper&#8208;D&#8208;amino acid metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) coatings with precisely controlled structural symmetries. An intermediate adhesive layer comprising amorphous metal&#8208;polyphenol networks ensures robust and uniform deployment of MOF nanoarmors. This chiral coating can significantly reduce bacterial or microalgae biofilm attachment and eradicate a broad spectrum of mature biofilms through synergistic active defensive mechanisms.








Abstract
Surface coatings are designed to mitigate pervasive biofouling herald, a new era of surface protection in complex biological environments. However, existing strategies are plagued by persistent and recurrent biofilm attachment, despite the use of bactericidal agents. Herein, a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based coating with conformal microstructures to enable a new anti&#8208;biofouling mode that involves spontaneous biofilm disassembly followed by bacterial eradication is developed. A facile and universal metal&#8208;polyphenol network (MPN) is designed to robustly anchor the MOF nanoarmor of biocidal Cu2+ ions and anti&#8208;biofilm d&#8208;amino acid ligands to a variety of substrates across different material categories and surface topologies. Incorporating a diverse array of chiral amino acids endows the resultant coatings with widespread signals for biofilm dispersal, facilitating copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodynamic reactions and inherent mechano&#8208;bactericidal activities. This synergistic mechanism yields unprecedented anti&#8208;biofouling efficacy elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing transcriptomics analysis, enhancing broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, preventing biofilm formation, and destroying mature biofilms. Additionally, the chelation&#8208;directed amorphous/crystalline coatings can activate photoluminescent properties to inhibit the settlement of microalgae biofilms. This study provides a distinctive perspective on chirality&#8208;enhanced antimicrobial behaviors and pioneers a rational pathway toward developing next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;biofouling coatings for diverse applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (HEMOFs): A New Frontier in Materials Design for CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) are synthesized with up to 15 distinct metals, representing an unprecedented level of complexity for MOFs. A suite of complementary characterization techniques and density functional theory&#160;calculations unravel the metal distributions in the materials; well&#8208;mixed heterometallic clusters are directly visualized by high resolution microscopy tools. The HEMOFs are highly active for CO2 epoxidation under mild conditions.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) emerged as promising candidates for a diverse array of chemical transformations, including CO2 utilization. However, traditional HEMs catalysts are nonporous, limiting their activity to surface sites. Designing HEMs with intrinsic porosity can open the door toward enhanced reactivity while maintaining the many benefits of high configurational entropy. Here, a synergistic experimental, analytical, and theoretical approach to design the first high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) derived from polynuclear metal clusters is implemented, a novel class of porous HEMs that is highly active for CO2 fixation under mild conditions and short reaction times, outperforming existing heterogeneous catalysts. HEMOFs with up to 15 distinct metals are synthesized (the highest number of metals ever incorporated into a single MOF) and, for the first time, homogenous metal mixing within individual clusters is directly observed via high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Importantly, density functional theory studies provide unprecedented insight into the electronic structures of HEMOFs, demonstrating that the density of states in heterometallic clusters is highly sensitive to metal composition. This work dramatically advances HEMOF materials design, paving the way for further exploration of HEMs and offers new avenues for the development of multifunctional materials with tailored properties for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Pyridinic/Pyrrolic N Enabling N/S Co&#8208;Doped Holey Graphene with Accelerated Kinetics for Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide, which delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclic stability as anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials hold great promise for K&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost, adjustable interlayer spacing, and high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, the narrow interlayer spacing significantly restricts their potassium storage ability. Herein, hierarchical N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene (NSEHG) with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through micro&#8208;explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide (GO). The underlying mechanism of the micro&#8208;explosive exfoliation of GO is revealed. The NSEHG electrode delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1), and robust cyclic stability (0.005% decay per cycle after 4400 cycles at 5 A&#160;g&#8722;1), exceeding most of the previously reported graphene anodes in K&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, the NSEHG electrode exhibits encouraging performances as anodes for Li&#8208;/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled activated carbon||NSEHG potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor can deliver an impressive energy density of 141 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance with 96.1% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work can offer helpful fundamental insights into design and scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Factor&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Precursors Enable On&#8208;Demand Thermoset Degradation and Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversibility of the integrated dynamic bond, controlled by two factors, can be triggered under mild and specific conditions. When this reversibility is deactivated, the resulting network polymers exhibit life&#8208;span stability. Conversely, when the reversibility is activated by applying both control factors, the polymers offer easy and on&#8208;demand degradability and recyclability.








Abstract
Thermosets are well known for their advantages such as high stability and chemical resistance. However, developing sustainable thermosets with degradability and recyclability faces several principal challenges, including reconciling the desired characteristics during service with the recycling and reprocessing properties required at the end of life, establishing efficient methods for large&#8208;scale synthesis, and aligning with current manufacturing process. Here a general strategy is presented for the on&#8208;demand degradation and recycling of thermosets under mild conditions utilizing dynamic precursors with dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled reversibility. Specifically, dynamic triazine crosslinkers are introduced through dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) into the precursor polyols used in polyurethane (PU) synthesis. Upon removal of the catalyst and alcohol, the reversibility of SNAr is deactivated, allowing for the use of standard PU polymerization techniques such as injection molding, casting, and foaming. The resulting cyanurate&#8208;crosslinked PUs maintain high stability and diverse mechanical properties of traditional crosslinked PUs, yet offer the advantage of easy on&#8208;demand depolymerization for recycling by activating the reversibility of SNAr under specific but mild conditions&#8212;a combination of base, alcohol, and mild heat. It is envisioned that this approach, involving the pre&#8208;installation of dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled dynamic crosslinkers, can be broadly applied to current thermosetting plastic manufacturing processes, introducing enhanced&#160;sustainability.

         <title>Flexible Temperature Sensor with High Reproducibility and Wireless Closed&#8208;Loop System for Decoupled Multimodal Health Monitoring and Personalized Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, achieving high reproducibility, more reliable sensitivity, and higher stability; it also has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A textile&#8208;based flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system is designed to monitor health status and autonomously regulate body temperature.








Abstract
Temperature and pulse waves are two fundamental indicators of body health. Specifically, thermoresistive flexible temperature sensors are one of the most applied sensors. However, they suffer from poor reproducibility of resistivity; and decoupling temperature from pressure/strain is still challenging. Besides, autonomous thermoregulation by wearable sensory systems is in high demand, but conventional commercial apparatuses are cumbersome and not suitable for long&#8208;term portable use. Here, a material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, precluding the detriment caused by shape expansion/shrinkage with temperature variation and achieving high reproducibility. The strategy also obtains more reliable sensitivity and higher stability, and the designed thermoresistive fiber has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A smart textile woven by the thermoresistive fiber can decouple temperature and pulse without crosstalk; and a flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system comprising the smart textile, a heating textile, a flexible diminutive control patch, and a smartphone is designed and constructed to monitor health status in real&#8208;time and autonomously regulate body temperature. This work offers a new route to circumvent temperature&#8208;sensitive effects for flexible sensors and new insights for personalized thermoregulation.

         <title>Synergistic Intramolecular Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions Enable Robust Pure&#8208;Blue TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the dilemma between color purity and device lifetime for blue TADF emitters, synergistic intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions demonstrate great capability to enable robust pure&#8208;blue TADF emitters. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF material simultaneously exhibits the highest C&#9472;N BDE among blue TADF materials and desired photophysical performances, realizing record&#8208;high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 109&#160;h with CIEy = 0.16 and 81&#160;h with CIEy = 0.10.








Abstract
Stability&#8208;issues of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require further advancements, especially in pure&#8208;blue range of CIEy &lt; 0.20, existing a dilemma between color purity and device lifetime. Though improving bond&#8208;dissociation&#8208;energy (BDE) can effectively improve material intrinsic stability, strategies to simultaneously improve BDE and photophysical performances are still lacking. Herein, it is disclosed that synergistic intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (Intra&#8208;NI) can achieve not only the highest C&#9472;N BDE among blue TADF materials, but enhanced molecular&#8208;rigidity, near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yields and short delayed lifetime. Pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs based on proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF material realize high external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency and record&#8208;high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 109&#160;h with CIEy = 0.16. Furthermore, deep&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized devices exhibit high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 81&#160;h with CIEy = 0.10. The findings provide new insight into the critical role of Intra&#8208;NI in OLED materials and open the way to tackling vexing stability issues for developing robust pure&#8208;blue organic emitters and other functional materials.

         <title>Regulating the Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Performance with Controllable Distribution of Unconventional Phase Copper on Alloy Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional phase 2H Cu is synthesized through epitaxial growth on hcp IrNi template, and the distribution of 2H Cu can be well regulated by controlling reaction time, resulting in three kinds of IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures. Notably, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 with low Cu coverage demonstrates superior ammonia yield rate toward nitrate electroreduction, which is 3.6 times that of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 with high Cu coverage.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is emerging as a promising strategy for nitrate removal and ammonia (NH3) production using renewable electricity. Although great progresses have been achieved, the crystal phase effect of electrocatalysts on NO3RR remains rarely explored. Here, the epitaxial growth of unconventional 2H Cu on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi template, resulting in the formation of three IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures, is reported. IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 shows superior catalytic performance, with NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86% at &#8722;0.1 (vs reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) and NH3 yield rate of 687.3&#160;mmol gCu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, far better than common face&#8208;centered cubic Cu. In sharp contrast, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;30 and IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 covered by hcp Cu shell display high selectivity toward nitrite (NO2&#8722;), with NO2&#8722; FE above 60% at 0.1 (vs RHE). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 has the optimal electronic structures for NO3RR due to the highest d&#8208;band center and strongest reaction trend with the lowest energy barriers. The high electroactivity of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 originates from the abundant low coordination of Cu sites on the surface, which guarantees the fast electron transfer to accelerate the intermediate conversions. This work provides a feasible tactic to regulate the product distribution of NO3RR by crystal phase engineering of electrocatalysts.

         <title>K&#8208;Rich Spinel Interface of Air&#8208;Stable Layered Oxide Cathodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With layered oxide powders immersed in water, the K+ in the bulk phase is partially dissolved in water and accumulates on the surface of the particles. At a high K+ content, the layered phase on the surface is in situ converted into the spinel phase, which exhibits improved surface stability against air and maintains electrochemical stability in an ambient environment.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;containing transition metal layered oxides (KxTmO2), although possessing high energy density and suitable operating voltage, suffer from severe hygroscopic properties due to their two dimensional (2D)&#160;layered structure. Their air sensitivity compromises structural stability during prolonged air exposure, therefore increasing the cost. The common sense for designing air&#8208;stable layered cathode materials is to avoid contact with H2O&#160;molecules. In this study, it is surprisingly found that P3&#8208;type KxTmO2 forms an ultra&#8208;thin, potassium&#8208;rich spinel phase wrapping layer after simply water immersion, remarkedly reduces the reaction activity of the material's surface with air. Combined with Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations, this spinel phase is found to be able to effectively withstand air deterioration and preserving the crystal structure. Consequently, the water&#8208;treated material, when exposed to air, can largely maintain its good electrochemical performance, with capacity retention up to 99.15% compared to the fresh samples. Such an in situ surface phase transformation mechanism is also corroborated in other KxTmO2, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the air stability of P3&#8208;type layered oxides for K+ storage.

         <title>Synergistic Performance of Thermoelectric and Mechanical in Nanotwinned High&#8208;Entropy Semiconductors AgMnGePbSbTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing the configurational entropy to reduce the stacking fault energy, dense nanotwins in a new high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 are obtained. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries provide efficient phonon scattering and dislocation pinning, leading to a high ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and robust mechanical properties with a flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV at room temperature.








Abstract
Introducing nanotwins in thermoelectric materials represents a promising approach to achieving such a synergistic combination of thermoelectric properties and mechanical properties. By increasing configurational entropy, a sharply reduced stacking fault energy in a new nanotwinned high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 is reached. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries in this system provide an efficient phonon scattering barrier, leading to a high figure of merit ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and a high average ZT of &#8776;1.54 (300&#8212;823&#160;K) with the presence of Ag2Te nanoprecipitate in the sample. More importantly, owing to the dislocation pinning caused by coherent nanotwin boundaries and the chemical short&#8208;range disorder caused by the high configurational entropy effect, AgMnGePbSbTe5 also exhibits robust mechanical properties, with flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV.

         <title>Extended Surface Bands Enabled Lasing Emission and Wavelength Switch from Sulfur Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended surface band&#8208;enabled lasing emission has been realized from sulfur quantum dots. The reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain of sulfur quantum dots allows for the demonstration of lasing wavelength switching using a single inorganic gain material.








Abstract
The development of a lasing wavelength switch, particularly from a single inorganic gain material, is challenging but highly demanded for advanced photonics. Nonetheless, all current lasing emission of inorganic gain materials arises from band&#8208;edge states, and the inherent fixed bandgap limitation of the band&#8208;edge system leads to the inaccessibility of lasing wavelength switching from a single inorganic gain material. Here the realization of a single inorganic gain material&#8208;based lasing wavelength switch is reported by proposing an alternative lasing emission strategy, that is, lasing emission from surface gain. Previous efforts to achieve surface&#8208;gain&#8208;enabled lasing emission have been hindered by the limited gain volume provided by surface states due to the broad emission bandwidth and/or low emission efficiency. This challenge is overcome by introducing extended surface bands onto the surface of sulfur quantum dots. The extended surface bands contribute to a high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrow emission bandwidth, thereby providing sufficient gain volume and facilitating stimulated emission. When combined with whispering gallery mode microcavity, surface gain enabled lasing emission manifests an ultralow threshold of 8.3 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain, facilitated by molecular affinity, allows for the realization of the lasing wavelength switch from a single inorganic gain material.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Doublet Sensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in a new device concept, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.3&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) exciton utilization enables high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7%.








Abstract
Fast and efficient exciton utilization is a crucial solution and highly desirable for achieving high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the rate and efficiency of exciton utilization in traditional OLEDs, which employ fully closed&#8208;shell materials as emitters, are inevitably limited by spin statistical limitations and transition prohibition. Herein, a new sensitization strategy, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (DSF), is proposed to realize high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence. In the DSF&#8208;OLED, a doublet&#8208;emitting cerium(III) complex, Ce&#8208;2, is utilized as sensitizer for multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA. Experimental results reveal that holes and electrons predominantly recombine on Ce&#8208;2 to form doublet excitons, which subsequently transfer energy to the singlet state of &#957;&#8208;DABNA via exceptionally fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer for deep&#8208;blue emission. Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in the DSF mechanism, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.36&#160;&#181;s are achieved in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept deep&#8208;blue DSF&#8208;OLED, which achieves a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinate of (0.13, 0.14), a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0%, and small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7% at a luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The DSF device exhibits significantly improved operational stability compared with unsensitized reference device.

         <title>Flexible Artificial Tactility with Excellent Robustness and Temperature Tolerance Based on Organohydrogel Sensor Array for Robot Motion Detection and Object Shape Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust and flexible artificial tactility enabled by a tough, low&#8208;hysteresis organohydrogel sensor array ensures precise detection of robot motion and external pressure over broad temperature range. Further bolstered by machine learning, robot tactility achieves accurate recognition of grasped objects, thereby expanding the potential application areas of novel intelligent robots.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible artificial tactility is equipped to intelligent robots to mimic human mechanosensory perception. However, it remains a great challenge for hydrogel sensors to maintain flexibility and sensory performances during cyclic loadings at high or low temperatures due to water loss or freezing. Here, a flexible robot tactility is developed with high robustness based on organohydrogel sensor arrays with negligent hysteresis and temperature tolerance. Conductive polyaniline chains are interpenetrated through a poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) network with glycerin/water mixture with interchain electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, yielding a high dissipated energy of 1.58&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and ultralow hysteresis during 1000 cyclic loadings. Moreover, the binary solvent provides the gels with outstanding tolerance from &#8722;100 to 60&#160;&#176;C and the organohydrogel sensors remain flexible, fatigue resistant, conductive (0.27 S m&#8722;1), highly strain sensitive (GF of 3.88) and pressure sensitive (35.8 MPa&#8722;1). The organohydrogel sensor arrays are equipped on manipulator finger dorsa and pads to simultaneously monitor the finger motions and detect the pressure distribution exerted by grasped objects. A machine learning model is used to train the system to recognize the shape of grasped objects with 100% accuracy. The flexible robot tactility based on organohydrogels is promising for novel intelligent robots.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Derived 0D Perovskite Induced Surface Lattice Arrangement for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted CsPbI3 PSCs treated with inorganic&#8208;derived 0D Cs4PbBr6 perovskite nanocrystals show improved surface lattice arrangement, achieving a PCE of 21.03% and maintaining 92.48% stability after 1000&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun and damp heat conditions. Additionally, a module with a 64&#160;cm2 aperture area demonstrates a PCE of 17.39%.








Abstract
The inverted inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are prospective candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to inherent robust thermal/photo&#8208;stability and compatibility for tandems. However, the performance and stability of the inverted CsPbI3 PSCs fall behind the n&#8208;i&#8208;p counterparts due to poor energetic alignment and abundant interfacial defect states. Here, an inorganic 0D Cs4PbBr6 with a good lattice strain arrangement is implemented as the surface anchoring capping layer on CsPbI3. The Cs4PbBr6 perovskite induces enhanced electron&#8208;selective junction and thus facilitates efficient charge extraction and effectively inhibits non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs with Cs4PbBr6 demonstrate the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, reaching 21.03% PCE from a unit cell and 17.39% PCE from a module with a 64 cm2 aperture area. Furthermore, the resulting devices retain 92.48% after 1000&#160;h under simultaneous 1&#8208;sun and damp heat (85&#160;&#176;C / 85% relative humidity) environment.

         <title>Biomedical&#8208;Optical&#8208;Window Tailored Cyanines for Steerable Inflammatory Bowel Disease Theranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptamethine cyanines with customizable absorption wavelengths are presented in this work. Utilizing an IBD sensitive dyes pair, a photothermal dye with 810&#160;nm absorption and its fluorescent counterpart with 800&#160;nm emission, steerable IBD theranostic non&#8208;invasively is realized.








Abstract
Tailored photophysical properties and chemical activity is the ultimate pursuit of functional dyes for in vivo biomedical theranostics. In this work, the independent regulation of the absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of heptamethine cyanines is reported. These dyes retain near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission (except a nitro&#8208;modified dye) while feature variable absorption wavelengths ranging from 590 to 860&#160;nm. This enables to obtain customized functional dyes that meet the excitation and fluorescence wavelength requirements defined by the optical properties of tissues for in vivo biomedical applications. Typically, a nitro&#8208;modified photothermal active derivative Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 is used, which features strong absorption at 810&#160;nm in PBS, a wavelength that balanced the tissue penetration depth and non&#8208;specific photothermal effect, to realize non&#8208;destructive inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy via photothermal induced up&#8208;regulation of heat shock protein 70 in the intestinal epithelial cells. The corresponding amino&#8208;modified dye Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, which can be formed in health enteric cavity by Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 after oral administration, is a fluorescence compound with the emission of 800&#160;nm in PBS. Based on the IBD sensitive transformation of Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 and Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, in vivo IBD theranostic and therapeutic effect evaluation is realized via the synergy of fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy for the first time.

         <title>Spin Manipulation of Heterogeneous Molecular Electrocatalysts by an Integrated Magnetic Field for Efficient Oxygen Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external magnetic field can influence the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) activity of paramagnetic heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts, providing a new strategy for understanding spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical processes.








Abstract
Understanding the spin&#8208;dependent activity of nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) remains challenging due to the lack of structure&#8208;defined catalysts and effective spin manipulation tools. Herein, both challenges using a magnetic field integrated heterogeneous molecular electrocatalyst prepared by anchoring cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) deposited carbon black on polymer&#8208;protected magnet nanoparticles, are addressed. The built&#8208;in magnetic field can shift the Co center from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin (HS) state without atomic structure modification, affording one&#8208;order higher turnover frequency, a 50% increased H2O2 selectivity for ORR, and a &#8776;4000% magnetocurrent enhancement for OER. This catalyst can significantly minimize magnet usage, enabling safe and continuous production of a pure H2O2 solution for 100 h from a 100 cm2 electrolyzer. The new strategy demonstrated here also applies to other metal phthalocyanine&#8208;based catalysts, offering a universal platform for studying spin&#8208;related electrochemical processes.

These attributes are crucial technical enablers for the design and implementation of various electronic devices and systems within scientific exploration. Thus, the group harnesses additive manufacturing technology, specifically utilizing five&#8208;axis curved&#8208;surface multi&#8208;material printing equipment, to fabricate aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries with tungsten&#8208;doped manganese dioxide cathode for enhanced adaptability and customization. The five&#8208;axis linkage motion system facilitates shorter ion transportation paths for compact batteries and ensures precise and efficient molding of non&#8208;developable curved surfaces. Afterward, the compact cell is integrated with a printed nano&#8208;silver serpentine resistor temperature sensor, and an integrated functional circuit is created using intense&#8208;pulse sintering. Incorporating an emitting Light Emitting Diode (LED) allows temperature measurement through variations in LED brightness. The energy storage module with a high degree of conformity on the carrier surface has the advantages of small size and improved space utilization. The capability to produce Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) on curved surfaces presents new avenues for innovation in energy storage technologies, paving the way for the realization of flexible and conformal power sources.

         <title>Depth&#8208;Resolved X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Evidence of Intrinsic Polar States in HfO2&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia&#8208;based films has reignited interest in understanding the emergence of ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale. Using depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photo&#8208;electron spectroscopy, electrochemical states in pre&#8208;determined polarization states of epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) and Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO) films on SrTiO3|La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (STO|LSMO) are compared. More pronounced electrochemical changes are revealed in films with lower polarization, evidencing an intrinsic polar state.

Investigation focuses on the size&#8208;dependent polarization behavior, which is sensitive to content and movement of oxygen vacancies. Though polarization switching and electrochemical reactions is shown to co&#8208;occur, their relationship remains unclear. This study employs X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with depth sensitivity to examine changes in electrochemical states occurring during polarization switching. Contrasting Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) with Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO), a composition with an equivalent structure and comparable average ionic radius, electrochemical states are directly observed for specific polarization directions. Lower&#8208;polarization films exhibit more significant electrochemical changes upon switching, suggesting an indirect relationship between polarization and electrochemical state. This research illuminates the complex interplay between polarization and electrochemical dynamics, providing evidence for intrinsic polar states in HfO2&#8208;based&#160;ferroelectrics.

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based films has reignited interest in understanding the emergence of ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale. Using depth-resolved X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, electrochemical states in pre-determined polarization states of epitaxial Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HZO) and Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HLTO) films on SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|La&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO|LSMO) are compared. More pronounced electrochemical changes are revealed in films with lower polarization, evidencing an intrinsic polar state.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells via Enhanced Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Minimized Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diffusion&#8208;regulated ternary structure containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors enhances the absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. By integration with wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcells, a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% is achieved in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The compatibility of perovskite and organic photovoltaic materials in solution processing provides a significant advantage in the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. However, additional recombination losses can occur during exciton dissociation in organic materials, leading to energy losses in the near&#8208;infrared region of tandem devices. Consequently, a ternary organic rear subcell is designed containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to enhance the absorption of near&#8208;infrared light. Simultaneously, a unique diffusion&#8208;controlled growth technique is adopted to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layer, thereby improving exciton dissociation efficiency. This innovation not only broadens the absorption range of near&#8208;infrared light but also facilitates the generation and effective dissociation of excitons. Owing to these technological improvements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells increased to 19.2%. Furthermore, a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcell is integrated with a narrow&#8208;bandgap organic rear subcell to develop a perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. Owing to the reduction in near&#8208;infrared energy loss, the PCE of this tandem device significantly improved, reaching 24.5%.

         <title>Buried Interface Strategies with Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks are developed to control the perovskite energy level and defects at the buried interface of inverted devices. The power conversion efficiency is improved to 25.68% for conventional bandgap devices and 22.92% for wide&#8208;bandgap devices. Additionally, these cells demonstrated excellent stability, establishing a solid foundation for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Simultaneously controlling defects and film morphology at the buried interface is a promising approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, two new donor&#8210;acceptor type semiconductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed, COFTPA and COFICZ. The carefully designed COFs structure not only effectively regulates the morphology and defects of the buried interface film, but also realizes the alignment with the energy level of the perovskite film and enhances the extraction and transmission of the interface charge. Among them, COFICZ&#8208;treated inverted PSCs achieved a maxmum PCE of 25.68% (certified 25.14%), the inverted PCE reached a minimum PCE of 22.92% for 1 cm2 device. The efficiency of inverted PSCs with a 1.68&#160;eV wide bandgap reached 22.92%, which is the highest datum of the reported 1.68 eV wide bandgap PSC. This lays the groundwork for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Additionally, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated a high degree of stability during operational use and when subjected to conditions of high humidity and temperature.

         <title>Pushing Theoretical Potassium Storage Limits of MXenes through Introducing New Carbon Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through defect local atomic environment manipulation, the potassium storage potential of the interior carbon layers in typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes has been unlocked. New sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites in Ti3C2Tx MXenes are highly exposed by an atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, leading to record&#8208;breaking potassium storage capacities (291 mAh g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (more than 20 months). These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating the neighboring environment of defects and provide insights into future high&#8208;performance electrode design strategies.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;driven capacitive storage enhances rate performance and cyclability, thereby improving the efficacy of high&#8208;power electrode materials and fast&#8208;charging batteries. Conventional defect engineering, widely&#8208;employed capacitive storage optimization strategy, primarily focuses on the influence of defects themselves on capacitive behaviors. However, the role of local environment surrounding defects, which significantly affects surface properties, remains largely unexplored for lack of suitable material platform and has long been neglected. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes are chosen as model materials owing to metallic conductivity and tunable surface properties, satisfying the requirements for capacitive&#8208;type electrodes. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the potential of MXenes with modulated local atomic environment is anticipated and introducing new carbon sites found near pores can activate electrochemically inert surface, attaining record theoretical potassium storage capacities of MXenes (291 mAh g&#8722;1). This supposition is realized through atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, exposing new sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites. The resulting MXenes demonstrate unprecedented rate performance and cycling stability. Notably, MXenes with higher carbon exposure exhibit a record&#8208;breaking capacity over 200 mAh g&#8722;1 and sustain a capacity retention higher than 80% after 20 months. These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating defects' neighboring environment and illuminate future high&#8208;performance electrode design.

         <title>Multimaterial Digital&#8208;Light Processing of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Composites: A Versatile Tool for the Rapid Microfabrication of MOF&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method, combining DLP with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system, for the arbitrary and multiplexed micropatterning of MOFs over large areas while maintaining pore accessibility. Demonstrations include a luminescent oxygen sensor, an encryption system, and a colorimetric sensor, enhancing the accessibility and potential of MOF&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Patterning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their use in sensing, electronics, photonics, and encryption technologies. However, current lithography methods are limited in their ability to pattern more than two MOFs, hindering the potential for creating advanced multifunctional surfaces. Additionally, balancing design flexibility, simplicity, and cost often results in compromises. This study addresses these challenges by combining Digital&#8208;Light Processing (DLP) with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system to enable multimaterial MOF patterning. It demonstrates the desktop fabrication of multiplexed arbitrary micropatterns across cm&#8208;scale areas while preserving the MOF's pore accessibility. The ink, consisting of a MOF crystal suspension in a low volatile solvent, a mixture of high molecular weight oligomers, and a photoinitiator, is confined by capillarity in the DLP projection area and quickly exchanged using syringe pumps. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by the direct printing of a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based luminescent oxygen sensor, a 5&#8208;component dynamic information concealment method, and a PCN&#8208;224&#8208;based colorimetric sensor for amines, covering disparate pore and analyte sizes.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel method, combining DLP with a capillary-assisted stop-flow system, for the arbitrary and multiplexed micropatterning of MOFs over large areas while maintaining pore accessibility. Demonstrations include a luminescent oxygen sensor, an encryption system, and a colorimetric sensor, enhancing the accessibility and potential of MOF-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterning Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their use in sensing, electronics, photonics, and encryption technologies. However, current lithography methods are limited in their ability to pattern more than two MOFs, hindering the potential for creating advanced multifunctional surfaces. Additionally, balancing design flexibility, simplicity, and cost often results in compromises. This study addresses these challenges by combining Digital-Light Processing (DLP) with a capillary-assisted stop-flow system to enable multimaterial MOF patterning. It demonstrates the desktop fabrication of multiplexed arbitrary micropatterns across cm-scale areas while preserving the MOF's pore accessibility. The ink, consisting of a MOF crystal suspension in a low volatile solvent, a mixture of high molecular weight oligomers, and a photoinitiator, is confined by capillarity in the DLP projection area and quickly exchanged using syringe pumps. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by the direct printing of a ZIF-8-based luminescent oxygen sensor, a 5-component dynamic information concealment method, and a PCN-224-based colorimetric sensor for amines, covering disparate pore and analyte sizes. The multi-MOF capabilities, simplicity, and accessibility of this strategy pave the way for the facile exploration of MOF materials across a wide range of applications, with the potential to significantly accelerate the design-to-application cycle of MOF-based devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Spin&#8211;Orbit Coupling in an Indolocarbazole Multiresonance Emitter by a Sulfur&#8208;Containing Peripheral Substituent for a Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;blue indolocarbazole multiresonance emitter is developed by a sulfur&#8208;containing peripheral substituent, achieving an emission maximum at 456&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum of merely 12&#160;nm, a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, and a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of nearly 30% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
A fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) remains an ongoing pursuit for multiresonance (MR) emitters but faces formidable challenges, particularly for indolocarbazole (ICz) derived ones. Here, heavy&#8208;atom effect is introduced first to construct ICz&#8208;MR emitter using a sulfur&#8208;containing substitute, simultaneously enhancing both spin&#8211;orbit and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling to afford a fast RISC with a rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than previous maximum values. The emitter also exhibits an extremely narrow deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 456&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of merely 12&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%. Benefiting from its efficient triplet upconversion capability, this emitter achieves not only a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.1% in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes but also greatly alleviates efficiency roll&#8208;off, affording record&#8208;high EQEs of 29.9% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and 18.7% at 5000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 among devices with ICz&#8208;MR emitters.

         <title>Monolithic Integration of Full&#8208;Color Microdisplay Screen with Sub&#8208;5&#160;&#181;m Quantum&#8208;Dot Pixels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolithic photolithograph integration of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m perovskite quantum&#8208;dot (PeQD) pixels is achieved on 0.39&#8208;inch blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED screens. This integration demonstrates full&#8208;color image and video display capabilities, with remarkable features including brightness exceeding 400&#160;000 nits, an ultra&#8208;high resolution of 3300 PPI, and a wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC.








Abstract
Monolithic integration of color&#8208;conversion materials onto blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving full&#8208;color microdisplay devices. However, this approach still encounters challenges such as the blue&#8208;backlight leakage and the poor fabrication yield rate due to unsatisfied quantum dot (QD) material and fabrication process. Here, the monolithic integration of 0.39&#8208;inch micro&#8208;display screens displaying colorful pictures and videos are demonstrated, which are enabled by creating interfacial chemical bonds for wafer&#8208;scale adhesion of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m QD&#8208;pixels on blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED wafer. The ligand molecule with chlorosulfonyl and silane groups is selected as the synthesis ligand and surface treatment material, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;efficiency QD photoresist and the formation of robust chemical bonds for pixel integration. This is a leading record in micro&#8208;display devices achieving the highest brightness larger than 400 thousand nits, the ultrahigh resolution of 3300 PPI, the wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC, and the ultimate performance of service life exceeding 1000&#160;h. These results extend the mature integrated circuit technique into the manufacture of micro&#8208;display device, which also lead the road of industrialization process of full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Stable Cycling of Na Metal Batteries at Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study revisits the carbon interlayer strategy, establishing its threshold for Na deposition. Achieving an ultrahigh Na deposition capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8315;2 with 90% depth of discharge (DOD), this strategy addresses dendrite formation issues. This approach surpasses traditional hosting/seeding methods, which struggle with capacities &gt;10 mAh cm&#8315;2, offering valuable insights into interfacial ion transfer under extreme conditions.








Abstract
The development of sodium metal batteries has long been impeded by dendrite formation issues. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, exemplified by sodiophilic hosting/seeding layers, have demonstrated great success in suppressing dendrite formation. However, addressing high&#8208;capacity applications (&gt;10 mAh cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Herein, the study revisits the interlayer strategy by simply covering a carbon nanotube (CNT) film onto the surface of a sodium metal anode, unlocking its overlooked potential for ultrahigh capacity applications. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the interlayer's fast&#8208;ion&#8208;storage feature, enabling deposition at the interface without capacity limitations. Consequently, in symmetric cells, one&#8208;year long&#8208;term reversible cycling and a record&#8208;high capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8722;2 under 90% depth of discharge is achieved, representing a significant breakthrough for stabilizing Na anode. Furthermore, the full cell with a 50&#8208;&#181;m thin metal anode and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) delivers a stable capacity of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 for 270 cycles (94% capacity retention).

         <title>Multifunctional Copper&#8208;Phenolic Nanopills Achieve Comprehensive Polyamines Depletion to Provoke Enhanced Pyroptosis and Cuproptosis for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional Cu&#8208;Pic/HA nanopills have been designed to achieve total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting intracellular polyamines synthesis, enhancing polyamines consumption and reducing polyamines uptake. On the one hand, oxidative stress spawned by polyamines depletion can give rise to mitochondrial dysfunction and insufficient ATP supply, resulting in cuproptosis. On the other hand, polyamines depletion can activate the Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD pathway and up&#8208;regulate S&#8208;palmitoylation of GSDMD to induce enhanced pyroptosis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis caused by polyamines depletion provided a new entry point for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The overexpression of polyamines in tumor cells contributes to the establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth. Here, it have ingeniously designed multifunctional copper&#8208;piceatannol/HA nanopills (Cu&#8208;Pic/HA NPs) that effectively cause total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting polyamines synthesis, depleting intracellular polyamines, and impairing polyamines uptake, resulting in enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis, thus activating a powerful immune response to achieve anti&#8208;tumor therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from overall intracellular polyamines depletion not only leads to the surge of copper ions in mitochondria, thereby causing the aggregation of toxic proteins to induce cuproptosis, but also triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria, which further upregulates the expression of zDHHC5 and zDHHC9 to promote the palmitoylation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and GSDMD&#8208;N, ultimately inducing enhanced pyroptosis. Then the occurrence of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis is conductive to remodel the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus activating anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and ultimately effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis through comprehensive polyamines depletion provides a novel template for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional Cu-Pic/HA nanopills have been designed to achieve total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting intracellular polyamines synthesis, enhancing polyamines consumption and reducing polyamines uptake. On the one hand, oxidative stress spawned by polyamines depletion can give rise to mitochondrial dysfunction and insufficient ATP supply, resulting in cuproptosis. On the other hand, polyamines depletion can activate the Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway and up-regulate S-palmitoylation of GSDMD to induce enhanced pyroptosis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis caused by polyamines depletion provided a new entry point for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overexpression of polyamines in tumor cells contributes to the establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth. Here, it have ingeniously designed multifunctional copper-piceatannol/HA nanopills (Cu-Pic/HA NPs) that effectively cause total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting polyamines synthesis, depleting intracellular polyamines, and impairing polyamines uptake, resulting in enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis, thus activating a powerful immune response to achieve anti-tumor therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from overall intracellular polyamines depletion not only leads to the surge of copper ions in mitochondria, thereby causing the aggregation of toxic proteins to induce cuproptosis, but also triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria, which further upregulates the expression of zDHHC5 and zDHHC9 to promote the palmitoylation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and GSDMD-N, ultimately inducing enhanced pyroptosis. Then the occurrence of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis is conductive to remodel the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus activating anti-tumor immune responses and ultimately effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis through comprehensive polyamines depletion provides a novel template for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Carbon Dots with Intrinsic Photochromism and In Situ Radical Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to integrate afterglow and photochromism in carbon dots (CDs) by constructing the embedded naphthalene imide (NI) structure and encapsulating the CDs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Significantly, good appearance color tunability from colorless to brown, wide transition of luminous color from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow with lifetime up to 253 ms are observed.








Abstract
The combination of advanced photoluminescence characteristics to photochromism is highly attractive in preparing high&#8208;performance multifunctional photo&#8208;responsive materials for optoelectronic applications. However, this is rather challenging in material design owing to the limited mechanism understanding and construction principles. Here, an effective strategy to integrate photochromism and afterglow emission in carbon dots (CDs) is proposed through embedding naphthaleneimide (NI) structure in CDs followed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) encapsulation. The NI&#8208;structured CDs&#8208;PVP shows intrinsic photochromism owing to the in situ formation of NI&#8208;radical anions and controllable multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive afterglow behaviors related to the oxygen&#8208;trigged triplet exciton quenching and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the pristine CDs to the photoactivated CDs radicals. Notably, a wide range of appearance colors from colorless to brown, luminescence color transition from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow lifetime up to 253&#160;ms are observed. With the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;chromic and stimuli&#8208;luminescent CDs&#8208;PVP film dynamically responsive to multiple external stimuli, reversible secure snapchat, data encryption/decryption and synaptic imaging recognition are realized. These findings demonstrate a fundamental principle to design multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photochromic CDs with afterglow, providing important understandings on the synergic mechanism of dynamic photochromism and emission behaviors and thereby expanding their applications in advanced information anti&#8208;counterfeiting and artificial intelligence.

         <title>A Click Chemistry Strategy Toward Spin&#8208;Polarized Transition&#8208;Metal Single Site Catalysts for Dynamic Probing of Sulfur Redox Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe single site catalysts with low spin state accelerate the conversion kinetics toward polysulfides. The evolution of Fe&#8208;N bond polarizability is dynamically observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the system is extended to other MPcs, providing guiding principles for the design of single&#8208;site catalysts for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is a crucial approach to enhance the redox kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. However, the roles of a typical heterogenous catalyst cannot be easily identified due to its structural complexity. Compared with the distinct sites of single atom catalysts (SACs), each active site of single site catalysts (SSCs) is identical and uniform in their spatial energy, binding mode, and coordination sphere, etc. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined structure, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is covalently clicked onto CuO nanosheet to prepare low spin&#8208;state Fe SSCs as the model catalyst for Li&#8211;S electrochemistry. The periodic polarizability evolution of Fe&#8208;N bonding is probed during sulfur redox reaction by in situ Raman spectra. Theoretical analysis shows the decreased d&#8208;band center gap of Fe (&#916;d) and delocalization of dxz/dyz after the axial click confinement. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with Fe SSCs exhibit a capacity decay rate of 0.029% per cycle at 2 C. The universality of this methodological approach is demonstrated by a series of M SSCs (M = Mn, Co, and Ni) with similar variation of electronic configuration. This work provides guidance for the design of efficient electrocatalysis in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Biodegradable Piezoelectric&#8208;Conductive Integrated Hydrogel Scaffold for Repair of Osteochondral Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin is reported. In vivo implantation experiments in Parma pig show that piezoelectric&#8208;conductive hydrogel scaffold achieves promising repair results, providing a versatile platform for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Osteochondral injury is a prevalent condition for which no specific treatment is currently available. This study presents a piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin (Gel&#8208;PC). The piezoelectricity of the scaffold is achieved through the modification of diphenylalanine (FF) assembly on the pore surface, while the conductive properties of scaffold are achieved by the incorporating poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene). In vitro experiments demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) undergo biphasic division during differentiation. In vivo studies using a Parma pig model of osteochondral defects demonstrate that the piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold exhibits superior reparative efficacy. Notably, the generation of electrical stimulation is linked to joint movement. During joint activity, mechanical forces compress the scaffold, leading to deformation and the subsequent generation of an electric potential difference. The positive charges accumulated on the upper layer of the scaffold attract BMSCs, promoting their migration to the upper layer and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the negative charges in the lower layer induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Overall, this piezoelectric&#8208;conducive scaffold provides a promising platform for the effective repair of osteochondral defects.

         <title>Mass Production of Multishell Hollow SiO2 Spheres With Adjustable Void Ratios and Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating transmissions and reactions. However, practical applications are severely hindered due to the high costs and low production efficiency. Herein, a precursor hydrolysis method is developed, which enables the cost&#8208;effective production of SiO2 MHSs on a large scale and adjusting on its void ratios.








Abstract
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) as supports have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating mass transport and chemical reactions. However, practical applications of SiO2 MHSs are severely hindered because of their high costs and low production efficiency issues. Herein, it is overcome these obstacles by developing a precursor hydrolysis method and demonstrate a cost&#8208;effective production of void&#8208;ratio tunable SiO2 MHSs on a large scale, which has a much lower cavitation temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) and one order of magnitude decrease in cost. In addition, the new method can also be applied to fabricate TiO2 and SnO2 hollow spheres (HSs). In particular, an NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy is developed to tune the pore diameters and pore distributions of SiO2 MHSs with different void ratios. SiO2 MHSs with varying void ratios and pore distributions have the broadest controlling release time ranges (30&#8211;430&#160;h). The precursor hydrolysis method and NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy offer adequate stimulus to push forward SiO2 MHSs from laboratory&#8208;scale to industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Multispectral Molecular Chiral Barcoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique chiral sensing platform is introduced that utilizes a pixelated array of achiral plasmonic nanostructures to perform Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) and Vibrational Circular Dichroism (SEVCD) in the mid&#8208;infrared range. This method enables the unique identification of enantiomers and biomolecules through a chiral &#8220;barcoding&#8221; scheme, offering a robust, low&#8208;cost solution for drug and biomolecule detection.








Abstract
More than half of pharmaceutical drugs in use are chiral, necessitating accurate techniques for their characterization. Enantiomers, molecules with mirrored symmetry, often exhibit similar physical traits but possess distinct chemical and biological implications. This study harnesses the strong light&#8208;matter interaction induced by &#8220;superchiral&#8221; light to perform Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) induced vibrational circular dichroism measurements in the mid&#8208;infrared spectral region. Utilizing a nanopatterned pixelated array of achiral plasmonic nanostructures, the system allows unique identification of enantiomers and biomolecules. Tunability of plasmon resonance facilitates spectral variation of the optical chirality over a wide infrared range, enabling development of a unique chiral &#8220;barcoding&#8221; scheme to distinguish chiral molecules based on their infrared fingerprint. This simple, yet robust sensor presents a low&#8208;cost solution for chiral mapping of drugs and biomolecules.

         <title>Ultrasmall Enzyodynamic PANoptosis Nano&#8208;Inducers for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy and Lung Metastasis Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>

This work reports on the engineering of ultrasmall PANoptosis nano&#8208;inducers for ultrasound&#8208;amplified hepatocellular carcinoma therapy and lung metastasis inhibition through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Addressing the inefficiency of current therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma is an urgent and pressing challenge. PANoptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, presents a dependable strategy for combating cancer by engaging multiple cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). In this study, an ultrasmall Bi2Sn2O7 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;magnified multienzyme&#8208;mimicking properties is designed and engineered as a PANoptosis inducer through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species, finally triggering the activation of PANoptosis process. The role of PANoptosis inducer has been verified by the expression of related proteins, including cleaved Caspase 3, NLRP3, N&#8208;GSDMD, cleaved Caspase 1, p&#8208;MLKL, and RIPK3. The inclusion of external ultrasonic irradiation significantly augments the enzyodynamic therapeutic efficiency. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic efficacy, along with inhibition of lung metastasis, validate the benefits of the Bi2Sn2O7&#8208;mediated PANoptosis pathway. This study not only elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying Bi2Sn2O7 as a PANoptosis inducer, but also offers a novel perspective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction with 1000&#8208;H Stability on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;loaded TiO2 as an efficient and sintering&#8208;resistant catalyst for the light&#8208;driven RWGS with long&#8208;term stability of 1000&#160;h is developed. In situ characterizations confirm that the slow diffusion effect of high&#8208;entropy alloys endows the catalyst with excellent structural stability and the hydrogen surface coverage weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, which solve two major problems of catalyst deactivation &#8722; sintering and poisoning to synergistically enable the unparalleled stability.








Abstract
Highly stable and active catalysts are of significant importance and a longstanding challenge for a number of industrial chemical transformations. Here, motivated by the principle of the high entropy&#8208;stabilized structure, high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;loaded porous TiO2 as an efficient and sintering&#8208;resistant catalyst for the light&#8208;driven reverse water gas&#8210;shift reaction without external heating is synthesized. The optimized CoNiCuPdRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of 1000&#160;h (1.23&#160;mol&#160;gmetal
&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO production rate, &gt;99% high selectivity). In situ characterizations confirm that the slow diffusion effect of high&#8208;entropy alloys endows the catalyst with excellent structural stability. The CO adsorption measurements and theoretical calculations consolidate that the hydrogen surface coverage weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface. Two major problems of catalyst deactivation &#8722; sintering and poisoning, are handled in one case, which synergistically enable unparalleled stability. This work provides new guidance for the rational design of ultradurable harsh&#8208;condition operation catalysts for industrial catalysis.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Ion Interaction Prompted Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article unveils an interaction between polymer and solvent in a gel electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion battery, that the polymer's polar group can participate in Li+ solvation structure and thereby inhibit the notorious solvent co&#8208;intercalation in graphite anode and excessive side reactions in Si and Li anodes. The quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes are beneficial for large current density operation, long&#8208;term cycling, or safety enhancement.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries using quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes (QSEs) have gained increasing interest due to their enhanced safety features. However, their commercial viability is hindered by low ionic conductivity and poor solid&#8211;solid contact interfaces. In this study, a QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) in 1,2&#8211;dimethoxyethane (DME)&#8208;based electrolyte is introduced, which exhibits remarkable performance in high&#8208;loading graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cells. Owing to the unique solvent&#8208;lacking solvation structure, the graphite exfoliation caused by the well&#8208;known solvent co&#8208;intercalation is prohibited, and this unprecedented phenomenon is found to be universal for other graphite&#8208;unfriendly solvents. The high ionic conductivity and great interfacial contact provided by DME enable the quasi&#8208;solid graphite||NCM811 pouch cell to demonstrate superior C&#8208;rate capability even at a high cathode mass loading (17.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8208;2), surpassing liquid carbonate electrolyte cells. Meanwhile, the optimized QSE based on carbonates exhibits excellent cycle life (92.4% capacity retention after 1700 cycles at 0.5C/0.5C) and reliable safety under harsh conditions. It also outperforms liquid electrolytes in other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with larger volume change. These findings elucidate the polymer's pivotal role in QSEs, offering new insights for advancing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.

Abstract
Multiscale particle size functional pesticide carriers can provide more efficient protection for plants, but this protection is difficult to achieve via single&#8208;scale formulation technology. This study presents a novel one&#8208;step method for the preparation of lignin&#8208;based micro/nanocapsules with controllable proportions within a unified system. This strategy enables the adjustment of the proportion of nanocapsules to between 18.81% and 85.21%. The microcapsules (MCs) vary in diameter from 2 to 3&#160;&#181;m, whereas the nanocapsules (NCs) span from 160 to 220&#160;nm, with an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 90%. An increased proportion of NCs in the system leads to faster release, heightened sensitivity to UV light, and enhanced penetration into the leaves. During Phytophthora capsici (P. capsici) infection, the NCs in the leaves interact with the defensive enzymes of the plant to quickly respond. Moreover, an optimal balance of MCs and NCs is key to effective fungicide use, not just a higher concentration of NCs. A 65:35 ratio of NCs to MCs ensures effective inhibition of P. capsici outside leaves and a rapid response to leaf invasion. This study enhances fungicide efficiency and advances the development of nanoresponsive fungicides to promote sustainable agricultural practices.

         <title>Responsive Protection of Magnesium Alloys From Multicorrosive Media by Constructing Nanofluidic Channels in Self&#8208;Repairing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidic transport systems are applied for in the field of corrosion protection, which exhibit the fastest releasing speed of inhibitors. Accordingly, the coating with nanosized channels possesses the shortest repair time (&#8804;7&#160;h), among all well&#8208;known Mg alloy self&#8208;repairing coatings reported to date.








Abstract
Low&#8208;density magnesium (Mg) alloys are excellent engineering materials, and can significantly reduce energy consumption by replacing existing steel and aluminum materials. However, Mg species are susceptible to corrosion, especially in harsh environments (high&#8208;temperature or acidic), severely limiting the range of practical applications. Here, 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is synthesized with pore diameters ranging from 1.5 to 2.9&#160;nm to obtain ultrafast nanofluidic channels. Loaded with silver (Ag+) ions, 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole (2&#8208;MB) inhibitors are immobilized in the COF channels through the silver bridges. Based on the strong metal&#8208;complexing capability, Ag+ ions precipitated with various corrosive media (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, SO32&#8722;, S2&#8722;, S2O32&#8722; SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, PO43&#8722;); meanwhile, the 2&#8208;MB inhibitors are rapidly released through the nanofluidic channels, forming a passivation film as a corrosion barrier to protect the Mg substrate. After integration with commercial polyethersulfone (PES), the COF&#8208;based coating exhibits high repairing capability achieving 100% damage restoration within 7&#160;h, outperforming all existing coatings of Mg alloys. Notably, the coating shows almost complete protection of Mg alloys after being treated in respective 473&#160;K, acidic (pH &#8776;4.0), and alkaline (pH &#8776;10.0) environments.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Induced Electronic Structure Reconfiguration toward Manipulating Electron Transfer Pathways of Metallo&#8208;Porphyrin for Enhanced AlCl2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) can be used to regulate the electronic energy levels and electron transfer pathways. Thus, the NiTPP presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 8.3% and 73.9% in comparison with the capacities of FeTPP and ZnTPP, respectively.








Abstract
The positive electrodes of non&#8208;aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) frequently encounter significant issues, for instance, low capacity in graphite (mechanism: anion de/intercalation and large electrode deformation induced) and poor stability in inorganic positive electrodes (mechanism: multi&#8208;electron redox reaction and dissolution of active materials induced). Here, metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) are introduced to effectively enhance both the cycling stability and reversible capacity due to the formation of stable conjugated metal&#8208;organic coordination and presence of axially coordinated active sites, respectively. With the regulation of electronic energy levels, the d&#8208;orbitals in the redox reactions and electron transfer pathways can be rearranged. The 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine nickle(II) (NiTPP) presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 32.1% and 77.1% in comparison with the capacities of H2TPP and graphite, respectively, which offers a new route for developing high&#8208;capacity positive electrodes for stable AIBs.

         <title>Extending The Calendar Life of Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries to 200 Days with Ultra&#8208;High Barrier Polymer Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending PCTFE with organically modified montmorillonite, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low water vapor transmission rate of 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1 due to the more complex and tortuous pathways for water permeation. The resulting 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs achieved an extended cycle life of 870 cycles and a calendar life of 200 days, with over 80% capacity retention.








Abstract
Scalable fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) have garnered significant attention due to huge potential applications in wearable technology. However, their widespread applications have been limited by inadequate cycle and calendar life, primarily due to the high permeability of the encapsulation layer to water vapor in ambient air. To address this challenge, an ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE) with organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) for the continuous packaging of FLIBs. Due to the high crystallinity (&#8776;40.21%) and small free volume (103.443 &#197;3), the PCTFE tube exhibited a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.123 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. Furthermore, through the melt extrusion, OMMT with its plate&#8208;like morphology are fully exfoliated and dispersed within the PCTFE matrix. This created more complex pathways for water, increasing the diffusion path length and thereby reducing WVTR to 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. This innovation enabled an ultra&#8208;long calendar life of 200 days and cycle life of 870 cycles for FLIBs, with over 80% capacity retention in ambient air. Additionally, 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs exhibited excellent flexibility, retaining an impressive 85.31% capacity after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. This research presents a simple yet effective approach to enhance the lifetime and practicality of FLIBs through building a high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based encapsulation layer.

         <title>Spatial Structure of Electron Interactions in High&#8208;entropy Oxide Nanoparticles for Active Electrocatalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

High&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles are dispersed on carbon support via a fast Joule heating approach, enabling the long&#8208;range electron interactions for bridging adsorption with CO2 to promote the reduction conversion.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5&#160;nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low&#8208;symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4, demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO2RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (&#8722;0.3 to &#8722;1.6&#160;V), and sustained stability for over100&#160;h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 achieves a current density of 350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining good stability for 24&#160;h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor&#8211;acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO2 adsorption status for eCO2RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.

         <title>Controllable Contact&#8208;Destructive Hydrogel Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) is innovatively proposed here. Such hydrogel actuator predetermined by diverse graphic patterns with the aid of 3D printing exhibits locomotion routes. Notably, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are well&#8208;demonstrated for the self&#8208;destructive hydrogel.








Abstract
Constructing hydrogels with spatially heterogeneous structures are crucial for unlocking novel applications. To this end, selectively removing a specific portion of hydrogels by facile and intricate destructive strategies is worth exploring. Herein, a &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator is presented, composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG). The destructive behavior of the hydrogel actuator is attributed to the surface tension&#8208;induced spreading effect and the enhanced water absorption due to the additive PEG. Parameters that act on these mechanisms are used to control the destruction of the hydrogel. During the destructive process, the hydrogel actuator exhibits locomotion routes predetermined by the graphic pattern with the aid of 3D printing. Additionally, such self&#8208;destructive behavior can be terminated by UV light irradiation when PEG is replaced with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). Significantly, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are realized with such self&#8208;destructive hydrogel. These results demonstrate that the present hydrogel has great values in soft robotics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, controlled drug delivery, and other related fields.

         <title>A Nucleophilicity&#8208;Engineered DNA Ligation Blockade Nanoradiosensitizer Induces Irreversible DNA Damage to Overcome Cancer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides, is developed. The DLBN, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, facilitating nucleophilic attack on phosphoester bonds. Remarkably, DLBN targeted inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance.








Abstract
During fractionated radiotherapy, DNA damage repair intensifies in tumor cells, culminating in cancer radioresistance and subsequent radiotherapy failure. Despite the recent development of nanoradiosensitizers targeting specific DNA damage repair pathways, the persistence of repair mechanisms involving multiple pathways remains inevitable. To address this challenge, a nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides is reported, which targets and inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance. First, the Schottky&#8208;type heteronanostructure of cancer cell nucleus&#8208;targeting DLBN effectively intensifies radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage via catalase&#8208;mimetic activity and radiation&#8208;triggered catalytic reactions. Notably, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, DLBN spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, a nucleophile with higher nucleophilicity, thereby exhibiting remarkable dephosphorylation capability at DNA nicks through facilitated nucleophilic attack. This enables the blockade of DNA ligation, a pivotal step in all DNA damage repair pathways, effectively interrupting the repair process. Consequently, DLBN resensitizes radioresistant cells by overcoming therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance, leading to a substantial accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. These findings offer insight into the dephosphorylation of DNA within nuclei, and underscore the potential of heteronanostructure&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer to block DNA ligation against therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Sensing Ionogels with Tunable Mechanical Properties and Environmental Stability for Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogels with a 3D supramolecular network can be constructed by cation&#8211;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding. The supramolecular ionogel possesses tunable mechanical properties, high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, high elasticity, and environmental stability. In addition, the ionogel can be used in flexible sensing and underwater communication transmission, demonstrating great potential in intelligent robots and wearable devices.








Abstract
Ionogels have garnered significant interest due to their great potential in flexible iontronic devices. However, their limited mechanical tunability and environmental intolerance have posed significant challenges for their integration into next&#8208;generation flexible electronics in different scenarios. Herein, the synergistic effect of cation&#8208;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding is leveraged to construct a 3D supramolecular network, resulting in ionogels with tunable modulus, stretchability, and strength, achieving an unprecedented elongation at break of 10&#160;800%. Moreover, the supramolecular network endows the ionogels with extremely high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, and high elasticity. Meanwhile, the high environmental stability and hydrophobic network of the ionogels further shield them from the unfavorable effects of temperature variations and water molecules, enabling them to operate within a broad temperature range and exhibit robust underwater adhesion. Then, the ionogel is assembled into a wearable sensor, demonstrating its great potential in flexible sensing (temperature, pressure, and strain) and underwater signal transmission. This work can inspire the applications of ionogels in multifunctional sensing and wearable fields.

         <title>Stable Seawater Electrolysis Over 10&#160;000&#160;H via Chemical Fixation of Sulfate on NiFeBa&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst that enabled chemical fixation of free SO42&#8211; by atomically dispersed Ba2+ and preferential electrostatic adsorption of SO42&#8211; on the electrode surface, resulting in unprecedented stability (&gt;10&#160;000&#160;h) at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
Although hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis combined with offshore renewable energy can significantly reduce the cost, the corrosive anions in seawater strictly limit the commercialization of direct seawater electrolysis technology. Here, it is discovered that electrolytic anode can be uniformly protected in a seawater environment by constructing NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst assisted with additional SO42&#8722; in the electrolyte. In experiments, the NiFeBa&#8208;LDH achieves unprecedented stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in both alkaline saline electrolyte and alkaline seawater. Characterizations and simulations reveal that the atomically dispersed Ba2+ enables the chemical fixation of free SO42&#8722; on the surface, which generates a dense SO42&#8722; layer to repel Cl&#8722; along with the preferentially adsorbed SO42&#8722; in the presence of an applied electric field. In terms of the simplicity and effectiveness of catalyst design, it is confident that it can be a beacon for the commercialization of seawater electrolysis technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis combined with offshore renewable energy can significantly reduce the cost, the corrosive anions in seawater strictly limit the commercialization of direct seawater electrolysis technology. Here, it is discovered that electrolytic anode can be uniformly protected in a seawater environment by constructing NiFeBa-LDH catalyst assisted with additional SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte. In experiments, the NiFeBa-LDH achieves unprecedented stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in both alkaline saline electrolyte and alkaline seawater. Characterizations and simulations reveal that the atomically dispersed Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enables the chemical fixation of free SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the surface, which generates a dense SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layer to repel Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; along with the preferentially adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of an applied electric field. In terms of the simplicity and effectiveness of catalyst design, it is confident that it can be a beacon for the commercialization of seawater electrolysis technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Broadband Spin and Orbital Momentum Modulator Using Self&#8208;Assembled Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherulite structure with vortex spontaneous polarity possesses circularly anisotropic refractive index and second&#8208;order nonlinearity, boosting a range of linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including spin&#8211;orbit coupling and second harmonic sum frequency generation. Through these processes, single spherulite generates minimum three optical beams with desired spin and orbital angular momenta at wavelengths ranging from near&#8208;infrared to visible range.








Abstract
The structural symmetry of solids plays an important role in defining their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The quest for versatile, cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale, and defect&#8208;free approaches and materials platforms for tailoring structural and optical properties on demand is underway since decades. A self&#8208;assembled spherulite material comprised of synthesized molecules with large dipole moments aligned azimuthally, forming a vortex polarity with spontaneously broken symmetry, is experimentally demonstrated. This unique self&#8208;assembled structure enables new linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including generating optical vortex beams with complex spin states and on&#8208;demand topological charges at the fundamental, doubled, and tripled frequencies. This work will likely enable numerous applications in areas such as high&#8208;dimensional quantum information processing with large capacity and high security, spatiotemporal optical vortices, and a novel optical manipulation and trapping platform.

         <title>Reversing Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor&#8211;Associated Cardiotoxicity via Bioorthogonal Metabolic Engineering&#8211;Driven Extracellular Vesicle Redirecting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel strategy named bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8208;driven extracellular vesicles (EV) redirecting (Biomeder) is developed to relief ICI&#8208;induced myocardial toxicity. Biomeder possessed the capacity of in&#8208;situ editing tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEV) with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptide and transporting the engineered EV into heart. Redirecting TuEV enabled immunosuppressive metastasis of tumor microenvironment to the heart, which simultaneously improved the effectiveness and safety of ICIs.








Abstract
The cardiotoxicity induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with high mortality rates. T cells play an important role in ICI&#8208;induced cardiac injury. The inhibition of local T&#8208;cell activity is considered an effective strategy for alleviating ICI&#8208;related cardiotoxicity. Tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute to immunosuppression via PD&#8208;L1 overexpression. In this study, a bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8211;driven EV redirecting (Biomeder) strategy for in situ engineered EVs with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptides is developed. Accumulated tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEVs) reverses the immune environment in the heart by increasing PD&#8208;L1 levels in cardiomyocytes and/or by directly inhibiting T&#8208;cell activity. More importantly, it is found that the redirection of TuEVs further disrupts immunosuppression in tumors, which facilitates anti&#8208;tumor activity. Thus, redirecting TuEVs to the heart simultaneously enhances the antitumor efficacy and safety of ICI&#8208;based therapy. Furthermore, the Biomeder strategy is successfully expanded to prevent ICI&#8208;induced type 1 diabetes. This Biomeder technique is a universal method for the treatment of various ICI&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field&#8208;Regulated Ultrafast Laser Supra&#8208;Wavelength Structuring Directly on Ultrahard Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser lithography of self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores as mid/far&#8208;infrared&#8208;modulating surfaces directly on ultra&#8208;hard metallic glass. The high regularity self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores has an adjustable period (1&#8211;5 &#181;m) and geometric shape (diameter 500 nm&#8211;6 &#181;m). It exhibits excellent infrared anti&#8208;reflection characteristics, the reflectance at 2.5&#8211;6.5 &#181;m has decreased from the original &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%.








Abstract
The ultrafast&#8208;laser&#8208;matter interactions enable &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; laser surface structuring, especially for materials difficult to process, with &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; self&#8208;organizing features. The subwavelength scenarios of laser&#8208;induced structuring are improved in defects and long&#8208;range order by applying positive/negative feedbacks. It is still hardly reported for supra&#8208;wavelength laser structuring more associated with complicated thermo/hydro&#8208;dynamics. For the first time to the knowledge, the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser lithography of self&#8208;arrayed supra&#8208;wavelength micro/nano&#8208;pores directly on ultra&#8208;hard metallic glass is developed here. The plasmonic hot spots on pre&#8208;structures, as the positive feedback, clamped the lateral geometries (i.e., position, size). Simultaneously, it drilled and self&#8208;organized into micro/nano&#8208;pore arrays by photo&#8208;dynamic plasma ablation and Marangoni removal confined under specific femtosecond&#8208;laser irradiation, as the negative feedback. The mechanisms and finite element modeling of the multi&#8208;physical transduction (based on the two&#8208;temperature model), the far&#8208;field/near&#8208;field coupling, and the polarization dependence during laser&#8208;matter interactions are studied. Large&#8208;area micro/nano&#8208;pore arrays (centimeter scale or larger)&#160; are&#160;manufactured with tunable periods (1&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m) and geometries (e.g., diameters of 500 nm&#8211;6&#160;&#181;m using 343, 515, and 1030 lasers, respectively). Consequently, the mid/far&#8208;infrared reflectivity at 2.5&#8211;6.5&#160;&#181;m iss decreased from &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%. The universality of multi&#8208;physical coupling and near&#8208;field enhancements makes this approach widely applicable, or even irreplaceable, in various applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Wearable Pressure Sensors with Stress&#8208;Concentrated Tip&#8208;Array Design for Long&#8208;Term Bimodal Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonfully conformal interface between the skin and electronics leads to further dissipation of weak physiological signals. This work enhances the mechanical transfer efficiency from behavior and physiological signals by introducing the stress&#8208;concentrated interface and self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel, achieving long&#8208;term stable monitoring. With the convolutional neural network algorithm for feature fusion, high&#8208;accuracy monitoring of human fatigue levels is realized.








Abstract
The great challenges for existing wearable pressure sensors are the degradation of sensing performance and weak interfacial adhesion owing to the low mechanical transfer efficiency and interfacial differences at the skin&#8211;sensor interface. Here, an ultrasensitive wearable pressure sensor is reported by introducing a stress&#8208;concentrated tip&#8208;array design and self&#8208;adhesive interface for improving the detection limit. A bipyramidal microstructure with various Young's moduli is designed to improve mechanical transfer efficiency from 72.6% to 98.4%. By increasing the difference in modulus, it also mechanically amplifies the sensitivity to 8.5&#160;V kPa&#8722;1 with a detection limit of 0.14&#160;Pa. The self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel is developed to strengthen the sensor&#8211;skin interface, which allows stable signals for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time monitoring. It enables generating high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and multifeatures when wirelessly monitoring weak pulse signals and eye muscle movements.

&lt;p&gt;The nonfully conformal interface between the skin and electronics leads to further dissipation of weak physiological signals. This work enhances the mechanical transfer efficiency from behavior and physiological signals by introducing the stress-concentrated interface and self-adhesive hydrogel, achieving long-term stable monitoring. With the convolutional neural network algorithm for feature fusion, high-accuracy monitoring of human fatigue levels is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great challenges for existing wearable pressure sensors are the degradation of sensing performance and weak interfacial adhesion owing to the low mechanical transfer efficiency and interfacial differences at the skin&#8211;sensor interface. Here, an ultrasensitive wearable pressure sensor is reported by introducing a stress-concentrated tip-array design and self-adhesive interface for improving the detection limit. A bipyramidal microstructure with various Young's moduli is designed to improve mechanical transfer efficiency from 72.6% to 98.4%. By increasing the difference in modulus, it also mechanically amplifies the sensitivity to 8.5&#160;V kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a detection limit of 0.14&#160;Pa. The self-adhesive hydrogel is developed to strengthen the sensor&#8211;skin interface, which allows stable signals for long-term and real-time monitoring. It enables generating high signal-to-noise ratios and multifeatures when wirelessly monitoring weak pulse signals and eye muscle movements. Finally, combined with a deep learning bimodal fused network, the accuracy of fatigued driving identification is significantly increased to 95.6%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Near Infrared Independent Modulation of Hexagonal WO3 Induced by Ionic Insertion Sequence and Cavity Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three modes of &#8220;bright&#8221;, &#8220;cool&#8221;, and &#8220;dark&#8221; can be achieved by hexagonal WO3 through progressive ion intercalation and unique cavity optical characteristics. Additionally, it can also realize a broadband shielding effect from 550 to 2000 nm and a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, suggesting excellent practical applications value and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;band electrochromic materials have attracted significant attention due to their ability to independently control sunlight and solar heat. However, these materials generally exhibit notable limitations, and the mechanisms for their dual&#8208;band independent regulation remain poorly understood. Here, the visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;independent regulation capabilities of hexagonal WO3 (h&#8208;WO3) are introduced for the first time. A structure&#8208;activity relationship that perfectly&#160;links the microscopic ion insertion sequence and cavity characteristics to the macroscopic dual&#8208;band electrochromic properties is established. The progressive ion intercalation process and the distinctive optical activity of the cavities are keys for enabling h&#8208;WO3 to independently modulate &#8220;bright,&#8221; &#8220;cool,&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Notably, h&#8208;WO3 demonstrates superior dual&#8208;band electrochromic performance with a broadband full shielding effect from 550 to 2000&#160;nm, achieving the widest full shielding band in dual&#8208;band electrochromic studies. Additionally, h&#8208;WO3 shows a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, and requires only 49.1 and 209.7 mAh m&#8722;2 to complete a full round&#8208;trip switch between &#8220;bright&#8208;cool&#8221; and &#8220;bright&#8208;dark&#8221; modes, respectively. The constructed device offers a dynamic temperature control range of up to 10.5&#160;&#176;C and supports a maximum voltage of 2.86&#160;V, underscoring its considerable potential for practical applications and energy efficiency.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Biligand Frameworks for Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are employed to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy can trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunotherapy, benefiting from its superior spatiotemporal selectivity and non&#8208;invasiveness. However, the practical applications of sonosensitizers are hindered by their low efficacy in killing cancer cells and activating immune responses. Here, two US Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are selected to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Through elaborate regulation of multiple metal/ligand coordination, the systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation, which can be used for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Moreover, Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] can downregulate intracellular glutathione levels that would destroy intracellular redox homeostasis and facilitate reactive oxygen species accumulation. The released tumor&#8208;associated antigens subsequently facilitate dendritic cell maturation within the tumor&#8208;draining lymph node, effectively initiating a T cell&#8208;mediated immune response and thereby bolstering the capacity to identify and combat cancer cells. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhancing Compatibility of Two&#8208;Step Tandem Catalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Over P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorus&#8208;doping strategy is investigated to optimize the mismatched two&#8208;step tandem process of NO3RR. During the tandem catalysis, there is more favorable release of NO2&#8722; in the initial 2e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Cu, and superior efficiency in NO2&#8722; capture and conversion in the subsequent 6e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Co(OH)2, ultimately contributing to remarkable NH3 production.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to realize ammonia generation and wastewater treatment. However, the transformation from NO3&#8722; to NH3 involves multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes and by&#8208;products (NO2&#8722;, H2, etc.), making high ammonia selectivity a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;phase nanoflower P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst consisting of P&#8208;Cu clusters and P&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets is designed to match the two&#8208;step tandem process (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722; to NH3) more compatible, avoiding excessive NO2&#8722; accumulation and optimizing the whole tandem reaction. Focusing on the initial 2e&#8722; process, the inhibited *NO2 desorption on Cu sites in P&#8208;Cu gives rise to the more appropriate NO2&#8722; released in electrolyte. Subsequently, P&#8208;Co(OH)2 exhibits a superior capacity for trapping and transforming the desorbed NO2&#8722; during the latter 6e&#8722; process due to the thermodynamic advantage and contributions of active hydrogen. In 1&#160;m KOH + 0.1&#160;m NO3&#8722;, P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 leads to superior NH3 yield rate of 42.63&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.04% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Such a well&#8208;matched two&#8208;step process achieves remarkable NH3 synthesis performance from the perspective of optimizing the tandem catalytic reaction, offering a novel guideline for the design of NO3RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Hybrid Passive Cooling for Power Equipment Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid passive cooling composite is designed to enhance heat dissipation for equipment by achieving &#8776;0.98 solar reflectance and providing high evaporation cooling power. The composite lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.








Abstract
While providing electrical energy for human society, power equipment also consumes electricity and generate heat. Cooling equipment consumes a significant amount of electricity, further increasing energy consumption and load on the power grid. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop low&#8208;energy and sustainable cooling technologies for power equipment. In this study, a hybrid passive cooling composite designed to enhance heat dissipation for heavy&#8208;load power equipment is introduced. Specifically, the composite material achieves outstanding radiative cooling performance with an average solar reflectance of up to 0.98, while its excellent atmospheric water harvesting performance ensures high evaporation cooling power without the need for manual water replenishment. As a result, the composite effectively lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.

         <title>Engineered Enucleated Mesenchymal Stem Cells Regulating Immune Microenvironment and Promoting Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bioorthogonal chemistry to function in the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm are combined to develop an engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells (Cargocyte). Cargocytes can modulate the two most important immune cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, by reducing NETosis and decreasing M1 macrophages phenotype polarization to regulate immune microenvironment and promote wound healing.








Abstract
Persistent excessive inflammation caused by neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction in the wound bed leads to refractory response during wound healing. However, previous studies using cytokines or drugs often suffer from short half&#8208;lives and limited targeting, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, the enucleated mesenchymal stem cell is engineered by aptamer bioorthogonal chemistry to modify the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm as a novel delivery vector (Cargocyte) with accurate targeting and sustained cytokine secretion. Cargocytes can successfully reduce NETosis by targeting the nuclear chromatin protein DEK protein with aptamers and sustaining interleukin (IL)&#8208;4 expression to overcome the challenges associated with the high cost and short half&#8208;life of IL&#8208;4 protein and significantly prevent the transition of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in murine and porcine wound models and have powerful potential to improve wound immune microenvironments effectively. Overall, the use of engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells as a delivery system may be a promising approach for wound healing.

Ultrasensitive Wearable Pressure Sensors
The non&#8208;fully conformal interface between skin and electronics leads to further dissipation of weak physiological signals. This work enhances the mechanical transfer efficiency by introducing stressed&#8208;concentrated interface and self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel. With the CNN algorithm for feature fusion, monitoring of human fatigue levels is realized. More details can be found in article number 2406235 by Yina Liu, Zhen Wen, and co&#8208;workers.

Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptors
In article number 2310407, Robert Tamp&#233; and co&#8208;workers introduce innovative nanotools to control T cell receptor (TCR) clustering, crucial for immune recognition. By comparing ligand&#8208;induced and ligand&#8208;free conditions, researchers discovered that architecture significantly impacts TCR assembly. This approach enhances our understanding of TCR activation, paving the way for advanced immunotherapies, including CAR T cell therapies. Image credit: M.F. S&#225;nchez &amp; R.

In article number 2405766, Yun&#8208;Lu Sun, Peilei Zhang, and colleagues develop the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser supra&#8208;wavelength structuring of self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores directly on hard&#8208;to&#8208;process (ultra&#8208;hard or high&#8208;melting&#8208;temperature) metals. The self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores have adjustable period (1&#8211;5 &#956;m) and geometry (e.g., 500 nm&#8208;6 &#956;m in diameter). They decrease the surface infrared reflectance at 2.5&#8211;6.5 &#956;m from &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%. The universality of multi&#8208;physical coupling and near&#8208;field enhancements makes this approach widely applicable, or even irreplaceable, in various applications.

The self-arrayed micro/nano-pores have adjustable period (1&#8211;5 &#956;m) and geometry (e.g., 500 nm-6 &#956;m in diameter).

Janus Swarm Metamaterials
Magnetoactive Janus particles (MAJPs) with engineered functional compartments provide tunable structure and properties that enable fast swarming response, remote actuation, and advanced functions in electronics&#8208;free configurations. MAJPs were implemented in swarm metamaterials with programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices. More details can be found in article number 2406149 by Zenghao Zhang, Je?ery E. Raymond, Joerg Lahann, and Abdon Pena&#8208;Francesch.

Manipulating Single Atom Catalyst Spin State
In article number 2408461, Hao Li, Yuan Chen, Li Wei, and co&#8208;workers utilize polymer&#8208;protected permanent nanomagnets to manipulate the spin state of a single atom catalyst. Without modifying atomic structure, significantly improved oxygen redox reaction performance is observed. This approach is applicable to other magnetic catalysts, offering a new strategy to investigate the spin&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.

High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
In article number 2407435 by Dorina F. Sava Gallis, R. Eric Sikma, and co&#8208;workers, a design strategy is implemented for the synthesis of high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) derived from polynuclear metal clusters containing as many as 15 unique metals. The complex metallic composition in HEMOFs creates a rich landscape of catalytic sites that enables the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article number 2408387, Jin Hyuck Heo, Fei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers present an inorganic 0D Cs4PbBr6 with a good lattice matching as the surface capping layer on the CsPbI3. This strategy effectively enhances charge extraction, suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, and significantly improves the device's performance (21.03 % for 0.12 cm2, 18.99% for 25 cm2, and 17.39 % for 64 cm2) and stability.

         <title>Advancing Heterogeneous Organic Synthesis With Coordination Chemistry&#8208;Empowered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution of coordination chemistry makes all the difference for single&#8208;atom catalytic organic synthesis. The relationship between the coordination structure and coordination effect of SACs and their action mode in organic synthesis is clarified. Current challenges and outlook are also described for potentially leading to the emergence of new catalytic insights.








Abstract
For traditional metal complexes, intricate chemistry is required to acquire appropriate ligands for controlling the electron and steric hindrance of metal active centers. Comparatively, the preparation of single&#8208;atom catalysts is much easier with more straightforward and effective accesses for the arrangement and control of metal active centers. The presence of coordination atoms or neighboring functional atoms on the supports' surface ensures the stability of metal single&#8208;atoms and their interactions with individual metal atoms substantially regulate the performance of metal active centers. Therefore, the collaborative interaction between metal and the surrounding coordination environment enhances the initiation of reaction substrates and the formation and transformation of crucial intermediate compounds, which imparts single&#8208;atom catalysts with significant catalytic efficacy, rendering them a valuable framework for investigating the correlation between structure and activity, as well as the reaction mechanism of catalysts in organic reactions. Herein, comprehensive overviews of the coordination interaction for both homogeneous metal complexes and single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic reactions are provided. Additionally, reflective conjectures about the advancement of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis are also proposed to present as a reference for later development.

         <title>Advanced Materials for Energy Harvesting and Soft Robotics: Emerging Frontiers to Enhance Piezoelectric Performance and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review is focused on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezoelectric response of advanced materials, and to address scale&#8208;up and device integration challenges for complex systems and soft robotics. The working mechanisms and operation modes are highlighted for each material class, along with the application potential of piezoelectric perovskites, polymers, and biomaterials within device architectures.








Abstract
Piezoelectric energy harvesting captures mechanical energy from a number of sources, such as vibrations, the movement of objects and bodies, impact events, and fluid flow to generate electric power. Such power can be employed to support wireless communication, electronic components, ocean monitoring, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices. A variety of self&#8208;powered piezoelectric sensors, transducers, and actuators have been produced for these applications, however approaches to enhance the piezoelectric properties of materials to increase device performance remain a challenging frontier of materials research. In this regard, the intrinsic polarization and properties of materials can be designed or deliberately engineered to enhance the piezo&#8208;generated power. This review provides insights into the mechanisms of piezoelectricity in advanced materials, including perovskites, active polymers, and natural biomaterials, with a focus on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezo&#8208;response and facilitate their integration into complex electronic systems. Applications in energy harvesting and soft robotics are overviewed by highlighting the primary performance figures of merits, the actuation mechanisms, and relevant applications. Key breakthroughs and valuable strategies to further improve both materials and device performance are discussed, together with a critical assessment of the requirements of next&#8208;generation piezoelectric systems, and future scientific and technological solutions.

         <title>Toward the Integration of Machine Learning and Molecular Modeling for Designing Drug Delivery Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of physics&#8208;based models from traditional simulation methods with data&#8208;driven models from artificial intelligence and data analytics paves the way for the rational design of nanocarriers for drug delivery.








Abstract
The pioneering work on liposomes in the 1960s and subsequent research in controlled drug release systems significantly advances the development of nanocarriers (NCs) for drug delivery. This field is evolved to include a diverse array of nanocarriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and more, each tailored to specific therapeutic applications. Despite significant achievements, the clinical translation of nanocarriers is limited, primarily due to the low efficiency of drug delivery and an incomplete understanding of nanocarrier interactions with biological systems. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration and a deep understanding of the nano&#8208;bio interface. To enhance nanocarrier design, scientists employ both physics&#8208;based and data&#8208;driven models. Physics&#8208;based models provide detailed insights into chemical reactions and interactions at atomic and molecular scales, while data&#8208;driven models leverage machine learning to analyze large datasets and uncover hidden mechanisms. The integration of these models presents challenges such as harmonizing different modeling approaches and ensuring model validation and generalization across biological systems. However, this integration is crucial for developing effective and targeted nanocarrier systems. By integrating these approaches with enhanced data infrastructure, explainable AI, computational advances, and machine learning potentials, researchers can develop innovative nanomedicine solutions, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Molten Salt&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Catalysts for Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy possesses specific functions, including providing uniform liquid environment, forming favorable reaction intermediates, generating strong polarity forces, exfoliating or etching reactants, and modulating the microstructure and crystal plane feature, thus enriching the creation pathways of high&#8208;performance catalysts.








Abstract
A breakthrough in manufacturing procedures often enables people to obtain the desired functional materials. For the field of energy conversion, designing and constructing catalysts with high cost&#8208;effectiveness is urgently needed for commercial requirements. Herein, the molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy is emphasized, which combines the advantages of traditional solid and liquid phase synthesis of catalysts. It not only provides sufficient kinetic accessibility, but effectively controls the size, morphology, and crystal plane features of the product, thus possessing promising application prospects. Specifically, the selection and role of the molten salt system, as well as the mechanism of molten salt assistance are analyzed in depth. Then, the creation of the catalyst by the MSAS and the electrochemical energy conversion related application are introduced in detail. Finally, the key problems and countermeasures faced in breakthroughs are discussed and look forward to the future. Undoubtedly, this systematical review and insights here will promote the comprehensive understanding of the MSAS and further stimulate the generation of new and high efficiency catalysts.

         <title>Electronics and Optoelectronics Based on Tellurium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an emerging p&#8208;type van der Waals semiconductor, tellurium (Te) exhibits great potential in advancing future electronics and optoelectronics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental properties and synthesis strategies of Te nanostructures, followed by a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in their application across various advanced devices, including electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and large&#8208;scale circuits.








Abstract
As a true 1D&#160;system, group&#8208;VIA tellurium (Te) is composed of van der Waals bonded molecular chains within a triangular crystal lattice. This unique crystal structure endows Te with many intriguing properties, including electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, chirality, and topological properties. In addition, the bandgap of Te exhibits thickness dependence, ranging from 0.31&#160;eV in bulk to 1.04&#160;eV in the monolayer limit. These diverse properties make Te suitable for a wide range of applications, addressing both established and emerging challenges. This review begins with an elaboration of the crystal structures and fundamental properties of Te, followed by a detailed discussion of its various synthesis methods, which primarily include solution phase, and chemical and physical vapor deposition technologies. These methods form the foundation for designing Te&#8208;centered devices. Then the device applications enabled by Te nanostructures are introduced, with an emphasis on electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and large&#8208;scale circuits. Additionally, performance optimization strategies are discussed for Te&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors. Finally, insights into future research directions and the challenges that lie ahead in this field are shared.

         <title>Advances in Functional Organosulfur&#8208;Based Mediators for Regulating Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosulfur compounds containing dynamic C&#8211;S/S&#8211;S covalent bonds, exhibit tunable structures, unique functional adaptability, and environmental friendliness, enabling the rational design of targeted functionalities. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances in their roles as functional mediators in optimizing the performance of diverse LMB systems and discusses the challenges, potential applications, and future research directions for this exciting class of materials.









Abstract
Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, their practical applications are hindered by lithium dendrite growth and various intricate issues associated with the cathodes. These challenges can be mitigated by using organosulfur&#8208;based mediators (OSMs), which offer the advantages of abundance, tailorable structures, and unique functional adaptability. These features enable the rational design of targeted functionalities, enhance the interfacial stability of the lithium anode and cathode, and accelerate the redox kinetics of electrodes via alternative reaction pathways, thereby effectively improving the performance of LMBs. Unlike the extensively explored field of organosulfur cathode materials, OSMs have garnered little attention. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in OSMs for various LMB systems, including lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;selenium, lithium&#8211;oxygen, lithium&#8208;intercalation cathode batteries, and other LMB systems. It briefly elucidates the operating principles of these LMB systems, the regulatory mechanisms of the corresponding OSMs, and the fundamentals of OSMs activity. Ultimately, strategic optimizations are proposed for designing novel OSMs, advanced mechanism investigation, expanded applications, and the development of safe battery systems, thereby providing directions to narrow the gap between rational modulation of organosulfur compounds and their practical implementation in batteries.

         <title>Nano&#8208; and Micro&#8208;Platforms in Therapeutic Proteins Delivery for Cancer Therapy: Materials and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein biologics is one of the future trends in oncology treatment, but free proteins and single&#8208;protein treatment show insufficient therapeutic effects. Various nanoparticle and microsphere platforms provide opportunities to overcome their inherent defects and achieve synergetic combination therapies. Herein, protein biologics types, delivery platforms, and platform&#8208;based combinational strategies are fully introduced step&#8208;by&#8208;step with relevant clinical and pre&#8208;clinical examples.








Abstract
Proteins have emerged as promising therapeutics in oncology due to their great specificity. Many treatment strategies are developed based on protein biologics, such as immunotherapy, starvation therapy, and pro&#8208;apoptosis therapy, while some protein biologics have entered the clinics. However, clinical translation is severely impeded by instability, short circulation time, poor transmembrane transportation, and immunogenicity. Micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles&#8208;based drug delivery platforms are designed to solve those problems and enhance protein therapeutic efficacy. This review first summarizes the different types of therapeutic proteins in clinical and research stages, highlighting their administration limitations. Next, various types of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are described to demonstrate how they can overcome those limitations. The potential of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are then explored to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of proteins by combinational therapies. Finally, the challenges and future directions of protein biologics carriers are discussed for optimized protein delivery.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence and Bio/Chemiluminescence Probes for Aminopeptidases: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminopeptidases as a type of exopeptidase can hydrolyze peptide bonds at the N&#8208;terminus of polypeptide and protein, serving as various key roles in the physiological and pathological processes. In this review, diverse representative examples of recent works about activatable aminopeptidase probes are summarized including sensing, imaging, and therapy, ranging from design, and working mechanisms to biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that catalyze the cleavage of amino acid residues from the N&#8208;terminal fragment of protein or peptide substrates. Owing to their function, they play important roles in protein maturation, signal transduction, cell&#8208;cycle control, and various disease mechanisms, notably in cancer pathology. To gain better insights into their function, molecular imaging assisted by fluorescence and bio/chemiluminescence probes has become an indispensable method to their superiorities, including excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and real&#8208;time and noninvasive imaging. Numerous efforts are made to develop activatable probes that can effectively enhance efficiency and accuracy as well as minimize the side effects. This review is classified according to the type of aminopeptidases, summarizing some recent works on the design, work mechanism, and sensing, imaging, and theranostic performance of their activatable probe. Finally, the current challenges are outlined in developing activatable probes for aminopeptidases and provide possible solutions for future advancements.

         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the principles and performance optimization strategies of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics from materials to devices and points out the current research challenges and future development directions of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendless and high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics play a significant role in exploring sustainable clean energy. Among them, AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics, benefiting from the disorder in the cation sublattice and interface scattering from secondary phases of Ag2Te and Sb2Te3, exhibit low thermal conductivity and a maximum figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit ZT of 2.6 at 573 K via optimizing electrical properties and addressing phase transition issues. Therefore, AgSbTe2 shows considerable potential as a promising medium&#8208;temperature thermoelectric material. Additionally, with the increasing demands for device integration and portability in the information age, the research on flexible and wearable AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics aligns with contemporary development needs, leading to a growing number of research findings. This work provides a detailed and timely review of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics from materials to devices. Principles and performance optimization strategies are highlighted for the thermoelectric performance enhancement in AgSbTe2. The current challenges and future research directions of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics are pointed out. This review will guide the development of high&#8208;performance AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics for practical applications.

         <title>Engineered Protein Hydrogels as Biomimetic Cellular Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extracellular matrix (ECM) influences cellular behaviors like proliferation and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with customizable properties, can mimic the ECM functions. These hydrogels, formed through self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, affect cells via bioactive domains in their polymer backbone. This review explores the modular design, stabilization methods, and future directions of these hydrogels as biomimetic scaffolds for cell culture.








Abstract
The biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a pivotal role in regulating cellular behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with highly tunable multifunctional properties, have the potential to replicate key features of the native ECM. Formed by self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels can induce a range of cell behaviors through bioactive and functional domains incorporated into the polymer backbone. Using recombinant techniques, the amino acid sequence of the protein backbone can be designed with precise control over the chain&#8208;length, folded structure, and cell&#8208;interaction sites. In this review, the modular design of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels from both a molecular&#8208; and network&#8208;level perspective are discussed, and summarize recent progress and case studies to highlight the diverse strategies used to construct biomimetic scaffolds. This review focuses on amino acid sequences that form structural blocks, bioactive blocks, and stimuli&#8208;responsive blocks designed into the protein backbone for highly precise and tunable control of scaffold properties. Both physical and chemical methods to stabilize dynamic protein networks with defined structure and bioactivity for cell culture applications are discussed. Finally, a discussion of future directions of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels as biomimetic cellular scaffolds is concluded.

         <title>Tuning Lipid Nanoparticles for RNA Delivery to Extrahepatic Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of lipid nanoparticles (LNP)&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This perspective summarizes the recent progress in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs and provides an outlook of shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms.








Abstract
RNA therapeutics have been successfully transitioned into clinical applications. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely employed as nonviral delivery vehicles for RNA therapeutics in commercial vaccine and gene therapy products. However, the bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of LNP&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This challenge underscores the need to design LNPs capable of delivering RNA to organs beyond the liver. In this perspective, recent progress is discussed in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs. Organ&#8208;selective targeting capability is achieved by either altering the composition of the LNP formulation or chemically modifying the ionizable lipid component. Both approaches result in changes in the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, which subsequently alters the composition of the biomolecular corona that adsorbs onto its surface following administration. The biomolecular corona is a known mechanism that mediates organ&#8208;selective LNP delivery. Furthermore, this perspective aims to provide an outlook on shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms. Potential efforts include targeting specific cell types, improving the safety profile of LNPs, and developing strategies to overcome physiological barriers against organ&#8208;specific delivery.

         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a popular subject, and there have been increasing reports on this subject. One challenge in such a situation is reporting appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the others&#8217; results. This paper provides basic information concerning the experimental setup, data acquisition and processing methods, and standardized denotation of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a very popular research subject in recent years. Consequently, it is important to report appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the results generated by others. However, experimental methods and measures of photocatalytic performance are not yet sufficiently systematic. In the present manuscript, experimental procedures and standardization of photocatalytic performance are described in relation to the basic theory of photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Nanomechanical Crystalline AlN Resonators with High Quality Factors for Quantum Optoelectromechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators enable low&#8208;noise sensing and quantum technology applications. This work realizes high&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators in a crystalline and piezoelectric material by exploiting dissipation dilution in a tensile&#8208;strained AlN thin film. This achievement paves the way for hybrid quantum optoelectromechanical devices operating at room temperature.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality factor (Qm) mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high&#8208;Qm mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high&#8208;Qm nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work, nanomechanical resonators with Qm up to 2.9 &#215; 107 made from tensile&#8208;strained 290&#8201;nm&#8208;thick AlN are realized. AlN is an epitaxially&#8208;grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. Nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a Qm &#215; fm&#8208;product approaching 1013 Hz at room temperature are demonstrated. A novel resonator geometry is realized, triangline, whose shape follows the Al&#8211;N bonds and offers a central pad patterned with a photonic crystal. This allows to reach an optical reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile&#8208;strained&#160;AlN.

         <title>Continuous Homogeneous Thin Liquid Film on a Single Cross&#8208;Shaped Profiled Fiber with High Off&#8208;Circularity: Toward Quick&#8208;Drying Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is achieved by using cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity. The asymmetric liquid film works synergistically with capillary effect to overcome PRI and maintains a homogeneous liquid film on a single fiber. Using such a facile strategy, quick&#8208;drying fabrics could be realized, offering new prospects for fluid coatings and functional textiles.








Abstract
Quick&#8208;drying fabrics, renowned for their rapid sweat evaporation, have witnessed various applications in strenuous exercise. Profiled fiber textiles exhibit enhanced quick&#8208;drying performance, which is attributed to the excellent wicking effect within fibrous bundles, facilitating the rapid transport of sweat. However, the evaporation process is not solely influenced by macroscopic liquid transport but also by microscopic liquid spreading on the fibers where periodic liquid knots induced by spontaneous fluidic instability significantly reduce the evaporation area. Here, a cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity, featured as multiple concavities along the fibrous longitude&#8208;axis, which enables the formation of a homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber without any periodic liquid knots, is developed. The high off&#8208;circularity cross&#8208;sections help overcoming Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability by tuning the Laplace pressure difference, further facilitated by capillary flow along the concave surface. The homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is responsible for maximizing the evaporation area, resulting in excellent overall evaporation capacity. Consequently, fabrics made from such fibers exhibit rapid evaporation behavior, with evaporation rates &#8776;50% higher than those of cylindrical fabrics. It is envisioned that profiled fibers may provide inspiration for the manipulating homogeneous liquid films for applications in fluid coatings and functional textiles.

         <title>The Effect of Organic Semiconductor Electron Affinity on Preventing Parasitic Oxidation Reactions Limiting Performance of n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type electrochemical transistors generally exhibit lower performance than their p&#8208;type analogs. The origins of the lower charge carrier mobility in electron&#8208;transporting organic semiconducting polymers are explored and observed that parasitic reactions involving ambient oxygen are a contributing factor. It is shown that a molecular design strategy to increase the polymer electron affinity successfully eliminates these reactions.








Abstract
A key challenge in the development of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting materials (OMIEC) for high performance electrochemical transistors is their stable performance in ambient. When operating in aqueous electrolyte, potential reactions of the electrochemically injected electrons with air and water could hinder their persistence, leading to a reduction in charge transport. Here, the impact of deepening the LUMO energy level of a series of electron&#8208;transporting semiconducting polymers is evaluated, and subsequently rendering the most common oxidation processes of electron polarons thermodynamically unfavorable, on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) performance. Employing time resolved spectroelectrochemistry with three analogous polymers having varying electron affinities (EA), it is found that an EA below the thermodynamic threshold for oxidation of its electron polarons by oxygen significantly improves electron transport and lifetime in air. A polymer with a sufficiently large EA and subsequent thermodynamically unfavorable oxidation of electron polarons is reported, which is used as the semiconducting layer in an OECT, in its neutral and N&#8208;DMBI doped form, resulting in an excellent and air&#8208;stable OECT performance. These results show a general design methodology to avoid detrimental parasitic reactions under ambient conditions, and the benefits that arise in electrical performance.

         <title>A Multifunctional Anisotropic Patch Manufactured by Microfluidic Manipulation for the Repair of Infarcted Myocardium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch based on microfluidic manipulation is easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallelly packing processes without involving complex machining and strong field stimulation. The multifunctional hydrogel patch can be a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.








Abstract
Engineered hydrogel patches have shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), especially anisotropic patches that mimic the characteristics of native myocardium have attracted widespread attention. However, it remains a great challenge to develop cardiac patches with long&#8208;range and orderly electrical conduction based on an effective, mild, and rapid strategy. Here, a multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch is presented based on microfluidic manipulation. The anisotropic alginate&#8208;gelatin methacrylate hydrogel patches are easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallel packing processes. The fluid&#8208;based anisotropic realization process does not involve complex machining and strong field stimulation and is compatible with the loading of macromolecular biological agents. The anisotropic hydrogel patch can mimic the anisotropy of the myocardium and guide the directional polarization of cardiomyocytes. In animal model experiments, it also exhibits significant effects in inhibiting ventricular remodeling, fibrosis, and enhancing cardiac function recovery after MI. These comprehensive features make the multifunctional hydrogel patch a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and future provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.

         <title>Carrier&#8211;Carrier Repulsion Limits the Conductivity of N&#8208;Doped Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined dependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient on the carrier density shows that the electrical conductivity at high doping is limited by the repulsion of electrons by other electrons. The carrier density nx corresponding to the maximum electrical conductivity coincides with the carrier density at which the Seebeck coefficient collapses onto Heike's law.









Abstract
Molecular doping is a key strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Typically, the electrical conductivity shows a maximum value upon increased doping, after which the conductivity decreases. This decrease in conductivity is commonly attributed to unfavorable changes in the morphology. However, in recent simulation work, has shown, that the conductivity&#8212;at high doping&#8212;is instead limited by electron&#8211;electron repulsion rather than by morphology, at least for some material combinations. Based on the simulations, this limitation is expected to show up in the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient versus carrier density: the Seebeck coefficient will follow Heike's formula if carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion limits the conductivity. Here, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured as a function of doping for a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors. Additionally, the resulting carrier density is measured using metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor diodes, which link dopant loading and the number of charge carriers. At high carrier densities, the Seebeck coefficient indeed follows Heike's formula, confirming that the conductivity is limited by carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion rather than by morphological effects. This study shows that current models of hopping transport in organic semiconductors may be incomplete. As a result, this study offers novel insights in the design of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Decoupled High&#8208;Mobility Graphene on Cu(111)/Sapphire via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth via chemical vapor deposition of decoupled graphene on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire is introduced. The resulting graphene is lying atop a thin Cu2O layer and is charge neutral, low strained, and easy to transfer. Electrical transport measurements reveal excellent room temperature carrier mobilities, exceeding 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, thus opening realistic pathways for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The growth of high&#8208;quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non&#8208;reducing low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu2O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post&#8208;growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry&#8208;pick up &#8212; a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 104&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 on SiO2/Si and 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).

     alt="Decoupled High-Mobility Graphene on Cu(111)/Sapphire via Chemical Vapor Deposition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth via chemical vapor deposition of decoupled graphene on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire is introduced. The resulting graphene is lying atop a thin Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O layer and is charge neutral, low strained, and easy to transfer. Electrical transport measurements reveal excellent room temperature carrier mobilities, exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, thus opening realistic pathways for high-performance next-generation applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of high-quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non-reducing low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post-growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry-pick up &#8212; a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The demonstrated growth approach yields exceptional material quality, in line with micro-mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes, and thus paves the way toward large-scale production of pristine graphene suitable for high-performance next-generation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedle Array Patches for Tunable and Versatile Intradermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) have unique geometries capable of delivering both solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;state cargo on a single platform. This technology enables tunable delivery kinetics from the order of minutes to hours for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. The modularity introduced by L&#8208;MAPs opens up drug delivery profiles for multiple payloads while enabling ease of administration.








Abstract
Using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing, a novel class of microneedle array patches (MAPs) is introduced, called latticed MAPs (L&#8208;MAPs). Unlike most MAPs which are composed of either solid structures or hollow needles, L&#8208;MAPs incorporate tapered struts that form hollow cells capable of trapping liquid droplets. The lattice&#160;structures can also be coated with traditional viscous coating formulations, enabling both liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state cargo delivery, on a single patch. Here, a library of 43 L&#8208;MAP designs is generated and in&#8208;silico modeling is used to down&#8208;select optimal geometries for further characterization. Compared to traditionally molded and solid&#8208;coated MAPs, L&#8208;MAPs can load more cargo with fewer needles per patch, enhancing cargo loading and drug delivery capabilities. Further, L&#8208;MAP cargo release kinetics into the skin can be tuned based on formulation and needle geometry. In this work, the utility of L&#8208;MAPs as a platform is demonstrated for the delivery of small molecules, mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and solid&#8208;state ovalbumin protein. In addition, the production of programmable L&#8208;MAPs is demonstrated with tunable&#160;cargo release profiles, enabled by combining needle geometries on a single patch.

         <title>Concave Grain Boundaries Stabilized by Boron Segregation for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave grain boundaries in platinum nanomaterials are identified as highly active sites for the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their unique geometric and electronic structures. The intentional segregation of boron at these grain boundaries significantly enhances their structural stability, establishing them as robust and efficient catalysts for the four&#8208;electron ORR.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a critical process that limits the efficiency of fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to its slow kinetics, even when catalyzed by platinum (Pt). To reduce Pt usage, enhancing both the specific activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Pt catalysts is essential. Here, ultrafine, grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticle assemblies are proposed as efficient ORR catalysts. These nanowires offer a large ECSA and a high density of concave GB sites, which improve specific activity. Atoms at these GB sites exhibit increased coordination and lattice distortion, leading to a favorable reduction in oxygen binding energy and enhanced ORR performance. Furthermore, boron segregation stabilizes these GBs, preserving active sites during catalysis. The resulting boron&#8208;stabilized Pt nanoassemblies demonstrate ORR specific and mass activities of 9.18 mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.40 A mg&#8722;1Pt (at 0.9 V vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts by over 35&#8208;fold, with minimal degradation after 60&#160;000 potential cycles. This approach offers a versatile platform for optimizing the catalytic performance of a wide range of nanoparticle systems.

         <title>Stepwise Stiffening/Softening of and Cell Recovery from Reversibly Formulated Hydrogel Interpenetrating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell&#8208;laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis is permitted in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner.








Abstract
Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered&#8208; particularly in a reversible manner&#8208; are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step&#8208;growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500&#160;Pa&#8211;6&#160;kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask&#8208;based and two&#8208;photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase&#8208;based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D&#8208;triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco&#8208;2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.

         <title>Chain Friction and Lubrication Balanced Ultra&#8208;Tough Polyacrylates With Wide&#8208;Span Switchable Stiffness for Strain&#8208;Programmable Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously incorporating long alkyl chains and nano&#8208;eutectics in the polymer matrix achieves polyacrylate composites with ultra&#8208;stretchability and high resilience. These properties, along with a wide&#8208;span stiffness variation triggered by the room&#8208;temperature glass transition, enable polyacrylate composites to exhibit biomimetic and time&#8208; or temperature&#8208;programmable deformations. Furthermore, polyacrylate composite artificial muscles can transform thermal energy into mechanical energy to perform work.








Abstract
Natural mollusks perform complex mechanical actions through reversible large&#8208;strain deformation and stiffness switching, which are challenging to achieve simultaneously in synthetic materials. Herein, it is shown that a set of polyacrylates designed according to a chain friction and lubrication balanced strategy shows&#160;ultra&#8208;stretchability (&#955; up to 324), high resilience (near 100% recovery at strain &#8805; 100), and wide&#8208;span stiffness switching (up to 2073 times). The typical emulsion polymerization method and casting technique are adopted to fabricate the polyacrylate films. Quaternary ammonium surfactants are used as the emulsifier and reserved in the polymer matrix to enhance the chain segment lubrication with their long alkyl group but improve the whole chain friction through the formation of nano&#8208;eutectics. These polyacrylates undergo multimodal mechanical responses, including temperature&#8208; or time&#8208;programmed deformation and load&#8208;bearing like artificial muscles. This molecular design principle and synthetic method provide a robust platform for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough polymers for soft robots with multiple customized functions.

Quaternary ammonium surfactants are used as the emulsifier and reserved in the polymer matrix to enhance the chain segment lubrication with their long alkyl group but improve the whole chain friction through the formation of nano-eutectics. These polyacrylates undergo multimodal mechanical responses, including temperature- or time-programmed deformation and load-bearing like artificial muscles. This molecular design principle and synthetic method provide a robust platform for the fabrication of ultra-tough polymers for soft robots with multiple customized functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Highly Emissive Infrared Yb&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters Engineered by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents stable, highly emissive Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) synthesized with zwitterionic C3&#8208;sulfobetaine ligands through a novel method. The Yb&#8208;doped NCs, optimized by machine learning, achieved an infrared photoluminescence quantum yield of 190% approaching the quantum cutting limit. They also exhibit exceptional long&#8208;term stability against heat, humidity, and light, indicating their potential for fundamental research and practical applications.








Abstract
Quantum cutting (QC) allows the conversion of high&#8208;energy photons into lower&#8208;energy photons, exhibiting great potential for infrared communications. Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals can achieve an efficient QC process with extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) thanks to the favorable Yb3+ incorporation in the perovskite structure. However, conventionally used oleic acid&#8211;oleylamine&#8208;based ligand pairs cause instability issues due to highly dynamic binding to surface states that have curbed their potential applications. Herein, zwitterionic type C3&#8208;sulfobetaine 3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;Dimethylpalmitylammonio)propanesulfonate molecule is utilized to build a strong binding state on the nanocrystals&#8217; surface through a new phosphine oxide synthesis route. Leveraging machine learning and Bayesian Optimization workflow to determine optimal synthesis conditions, near&#8208;infrared PLQY above 190% is achieved. The high PLQY is well maintained after over three months of aging, under high&#8208;flux continuous UV irradiation, and long continuous annealing. This is the first report of highly efficient and stable perovskite quantum cutters, which will drive the study of fundamental physics phenomena and near&#8208;infrared quantum communications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Interfacial Layer Enabled by Gating&#8208;Shielding Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode with beyond 9000&#160;h cycling lifespan is developed by introducing trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium as electrolyte additives. The additives enable dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer with a gating effect from pantothenate molecular layer for switching off active water while selectively transporting target Zn2+, and a dynamically electrostatic shielding effect from Ca2+ cations for suppressing dendrites and side reactions.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale application of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety and environment&#8208;compatible aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) is hindered by Zn dendrite failure and side reactions. Herein, highly reversible ZMBs are obtained by addition of trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium additives to engineer a dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer, which is enabled by a bioinspired gating effect for excluding competitive free water near Zn surface due to the trapping and immobilization of water by hydroxyl groups, and guiding target Zn2+ transport across interface through carboxyl groups of pantothenate anions, as well as a dynamic electrostatic shielding effect around Zn protuberances from Ca2+ cations to ensure uniform Zn2+ deposition. In consequence, interfacial side reactions are perfectly inhibited owing to reduced water molecules reaching Zn surface, and the uniform and compact deposition of Zn2+ is achieved due to promoted Zn2+ transport and deposition kinetics. The ultra&#8208;stable symmetric cells with beyond 9000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and over 5000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, are amazingly realized. The regulated&#8208;electrolyte demonstrates high compatibility with verified cathodes for stable full cells. This work opens a brand&#8208;new pathway to regulate Zn/electrolyte interface to promise reversible ZMBs.

         <title>Supercapacitively Liquid&#8208;Solid Dual&#8208;State Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercapacitively dual&#8208;state phototransistor is developed with microporous liquid&#8208;solid interface. A supercapacitively photogating effect greatly enhances responsivity up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and realizes high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;transduction of solid&#8208;state optoelectronics occurs in semiconductors or their interfaces. Considering the confined active area and interfacial capacitance of solid&#8208;state materials, solid&#8208;state optoelectronics faces inherent limitations in photo&#8208;transduction, especially for bionic vision, and the performance is lower than that of living systems. For example, a photoreceptor generates pA&#8208;level photocurrent when absorbing a single photon. Here, a liquid&#8208;solid dual&#8208;state phototransistor is demonstrated, in which photo&#8208;transduction and modulation take place at the microporous interface between semiconductors and water, mimicking principles of the photoreceptor. When operating in the water, an orderly stacked photo&#8208;harvesting covalent organic framework layer generates supercapacitively photogating modulation of the channel conductivity via a dual&#8208;state interface, achieving responsivity of 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.62&#160;&#215;&#160;1016 Jones at room temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than other photodetectors. Such bio&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;state optoelectronics enables high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging with responsivity greater than photoreceptors, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.

         <title>Structural Ordering in Ultrasmall Multicomponent Chalcogenides: The Case of Quaternary Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of ultrasmall quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is presented and a correlation between their composition, structural ordering, and optical properties is established. The work starts from the synthesis of Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se nanocrystals, followed by multipronged characterization of their structural and optical properties, and supported by theory calculation approaches. It is concluded that Copper atoms and cationic vacancies work in pairs to emit light from the I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group nanocrystals.








Abstract
The compositional tunability of non&#8208;isovalent multicomponent chalcogenide thin films and the extent of atomic ordering of their crystal structure is key to the performance of many modern technologies. In contrast, the effects of ordering are rarely studied for quantum&#8208;confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals. In this paper, the possibilities around composition tunability and atomic ordering are explored in ultrasmall ternary and quaternary quantum dots, taking I&#8208;III&#8208;VI&#8208;group Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se semiconductor as a case study. A quantitative synthesis for 3.3&#160;nm quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is developed and shown that cation and cationic vacancy ordering can be achieved in these systems consisting of only 100s of atoms. Combining experiment and theoretical calculations, the relationship between structural ordering and optical properties of the materials are demonstrated. It is found that the arrangement and ordering of cationic sublattice plays an important role in the luminescent efficiency. Specifically, the concentration of Cu&#8208;vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu&#8208;vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I&#8208;III&#8208;VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).

Specifically, the concentration of Cu-vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu-vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I-III-VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode Enabled by a Recyclable Biomass Bamboo Membrane Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass bamboo membrane separator with oxygen functional groups is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from the restrained activity of water molecules and anions, as well as the unique structure of the bamboo membrane, this separator enables Zn electrode to work at high capacity and current density with satisfying coulombic efficiency and lifespan.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have gained attention as viable energy storage systems, yet the occurrence of detrimental side reactions and Zn dendrite formation undermines the efficiency of Zn anodes. Controlling water activity have proven to be an effective strategy in mitigating these challenges. However, strategies such as electrolyte design and electrode protection layer show weakness to varying degrees. Here, a new oxygen&#8208;functionalized biomass bamboo membrane separator (denoted as BM) is proposed to restrain the activity of water molecules. This BM separator features a unique, multi&#8208;tiered 2D interlayer that facilitates rapid ion diffusion. Additionally, the oxygen functional groups of the BM separator can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, effectively transforming water molecules from a free state to a bound state. Consequently, the Zn/Zn asymmetric coin cell using BM can work at the ultrahigh rate and capacity of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 and 30&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 80&#160;h while its counterparts using glass fiber&#160;can barely work. Moreover, full cells using BM separator exhibited a capacity retention of 89.7% after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This study reveals the important influence of water&#8208;limited activity on Zn anode protection and provides an avenue for the design of novel separator.

         <title>Squid&#8208;Inspired Anti&#8208;Salt Skin&#8208;Like Elastomers With Superhigh Damage Resistance for Aquatic Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, the introduction of cation&#8208;&#960; interaction into polyurethane constructs a skin&#8208;like elastomer with extraordinary damage resistance properties (103.7 &#177; 45.7 kJ m&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt&#160;performance. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for aquatic applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and&#160;harsh oceanic environments.








Abstract
Cephalopod skins evolve multiple functions in response to environmental adaptation, encompassing nonlinear mechanoreponse, damage tolerance property, and resistance to seawater. Despite tremendous progress in skin&#8208;mimicking materials, the integration of these desirable properties into a single material system remains an ongoing challenge. Here, drawing inspiration from the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt elastomer with skin&#8208;like nonlinear mechanical properties and extraordinary damage resistance properties is presented. Cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is incorporated to induce the geometrically confined nanophases of hydrogen bond domains, resulting in elastomers with exceptional true tensile strength (456.5 &#177; 68.9&#160;MPa) and unprecedently high fracture energy (103.7 &#177; 45.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction effectively protects the hydrogen bond domains from corrosion by high&#8208;concentration saline solution. The utilization of the resultant skin&#8208;like elastomer has been demonstrated by aquatic soft robotics capable of grasping sharp objects. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for salt enviroment applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and harsh oceanic environments.

         <title>Toughening and Imparting Deconstructability to 3D&#8208;Printed Glassy Thermosets with &#8220;Transferinker&#8221; Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferinkers are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth. Incorporating transferinkers into 3D printable photopolymer resins leads to improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure into one that can more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis.








Abstract
Thermoset toughness and deconstructability are often opposing features; simultaneously improving both without sacrificing other mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and tensile strength) is difficult, but, if achieved, could enhance the usage lifetime and end&#8208;of&#8208;life options for these materials. Here, a strategy that addresses this challenge in the context of photopolymer resins commonly used for 3D printing of glassy, acrylic thermosets is introduced. It is shown that incorporating bis&#8208;acrylate &#8220;transferinkers,&#8221; which are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth, as additives (5&#8211;25 mol%) into homemade or commercially available photopolymer resins leads to photopolymer thermosets with substantially improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability with minimal impacts on Young's moduli, tensile strengths, and glass transition temperatures. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure from the densely cross&#8208;linked long, heterogeneous primary strands of traditional photopolymer networks to more uniform, star&#8208;like networks with few dangling ends; the latter structure more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis. Thus, transferinkers represent a simple and effective strategy for improving the mechanical properties of photopolymer thermosets and providing a mechanism for their triggered deconstructability.

         <title>Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface for Targeted Reinnervation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal&#8208;muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. After regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) surgery, the eRIPEN demonstrates long&#8208;term contractility for skeletal muscle tissue and positive effect on pain alleviation through innervation.








Abstract
A regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) offers a therapeutic solution for nerve injury through reconstruction of the target muscle. However, implanting a transected peripheral nerve into an autologous skeletal muscle graft in RPNI causes donor&#8208;site morbidity, highlighting the need for tissue&#8208;engineered skeletal muscle constructs. Here, an engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D skeletal cell printing combined with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelop for host nerve implantation. In this in vivo study, after over 8 months of RPNI surgery, the eRIPEN exhibits a minimum Feret diameter of 15&#8211;20&#160;&#181;m with a cross&#8208;sectional area of 100&#8211;500 &#181;m2, representing the largest distribution of myofibers. Furthermore, neuromuscular junction formation and muscle contraction with a force of &#8776;28 N are observed. Notably, the decreased hypersensitivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and an improved tibial functional index from &#8722;77 to &#8722;56 are found in the eRIPEN group. The present novel concept of eRIPEN paves the way for the utilization and application of tissue&#8208;engineered constructs in RPNI, ultimately realizing neuroprosthesis control through synaptic connections.

         <title>Bidirectional Vectorial Holography Using Bi&#8208;Layer Metasurfaces and Its Application to Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material&#160;systems with direction&#8208;asymmetric transport properties are scientifically intrguing with various potential applications. This study presents optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve generalized asymmetric transmission for any input polarization. Experimental results demonstrate polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed vectorial holograms, enabling advanced optical encryption and paving the way for future applications in optical computation, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
The field of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their various potential applications. Janus metasurfaces are noteworthy for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations are restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any input polarization are presented. The designs owe much to the theoretical model of asymmetric transmission in reciprocal systems, which elucidates the relationship between front&#8208; and back&#8208;side Jones matrices in general cases. This model reveals a fundamental correlation between the polarization&#8208;direction channels of opposing sides. To circumvent this constraint, partitioning the transmission space is utilized&#160;to realize four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed Janus vectorial holograms generating four vectorial holographic images are experimentally demonstrated. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach enables optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. The proposed&#160;mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computation, sensing, and imaging.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed catalyst with CoZn heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal species confined in defect&#8208;rich N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized for driving highly&#8208;selective two&#8208;electron ORR to H2O2 over the entire pH range and direct conversion to solid products for storage/transportation, as well as sequential activation via a regent&#8208;free sequential dual&#8208;cathode electro&#8208;Fenton process for pollutant degradation and detoxification.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized via spatial confinement growth. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibit superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs is favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reaches &#8764;100% in a range of 0.2&#8211;0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieves 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, exceeding most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 is converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Polyfunctional and Multisensory Bio&#8208;Ionoelastomers Enabled by Covalent Adaptive Networks With Hierarchically Dynamic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, a bio&#8208;ionoelastomer featuring covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding is obtained via melt building approach. The multifunction and multisensory capability endow the bio&#8208;ionoelastomer with comprehensive roadmap toward soft ionotronic devices in the field of remotely monitoring, diagnosing multi&#8208;metric, and complex physiological information.








Abstract
Developing versatile ionoelastomers, the alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will boost the advancement of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices. However, meeting the requirements of bio&#8208;derivation, high toughness, high stretchability, autonomous self&#8208;healing ability, high ionic conductivity, reprocessing, and favorable recyclability in a single ionoelastomer remains a challenging endeavor. Herein, a dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;based dynamic covalent ionoelastomer (DCIE), is proposed via melt building covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding (CAN&#8208;HDB), wherein lithium bonds aid in the dissociation of ions and the integration of dynamic disulfide metathesis, lithium bonds, and binary hydrogen bonds enhances the mechanical performances, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability. Therefore, the trade&#8208;off among mechanical versatility, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability is successfully handled. The obtained DCIE demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1011.7%), high toughness (3877&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (3.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), outstanding self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing for 3D printing, and desirable recyclability. Significantly, the selective ion transport endows the DCIE with multisensory feature capable of generating continuous electrical signals for high&#8208;quality sensations towards temperature, humidity, and strain. Coupled with the straightforward methodology, abundant availability of LA and HPC, as well as multifunction, the DCIEs present new concept of advanced ionic conductors for developing soft ionotronics.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optically Configurable Synaptic Transistors With Cluster&#8208;Induced Photoactive Dielectric Layer for Visual Simulation and Biomotor Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating poly (1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive can be employed as dielectric layer to develop electro&#8208;optically configurable transistors. By enhancing photoactivity of POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing, devices realize multiwavelength optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3&#8208;bits. The optical synaptic plasticity, biologically degradable dielectrics, and motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device open new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics and bioengineering.








Abstract
The integration of visual simulation and biorehabilitation devices promises great applications for sustainable electronics, on&#8208;demand integration and neuroscience. However, achieving a multifunctional synergistic biomimetic system with tunable optoelectronic properties at the individual device level remains a challenge. Here, an electro&#8208;optically configurable transistor employing conjugated&#8208;polymer as semiconductor layer and an insulating polymer (poly(1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate) (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive properties as dielectric layer is shown. These devices realize adeptly transition from electrical to optical synapses, featuring multiwavelength and multilevel optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3 bits. Utilizing enhanced optical memory, the images learning and memory function for visual simulation are achieved. Benefiting from rapid electrical response akin to biological muscle activation, increased actuation occurs under increased stimulus frequency of gate voltage. Additionally, the transistor on POC substrate can be effectively degraded in NaOH solution due to degradation of POC. Pioneeringly, the electro&#8208;optically configurability stems from light absorption and photoluminescence of the aggregation cluster in POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing. The enhancement of optical synaptic plasticity and integration of motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device opens new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics, synaptic computing, and bioengineering.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 strongly anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) for fast and stable potassium storage performance. The engineered A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode demonstrates high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and superb cyclability, as well as reliable operation in flexible potassium ion full cell.








Abstract
The pursuit of anode materials capable of rapid and reversible potassium storage performance is a challenging yet fascinating target. Herein, a heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) as an advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). The A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode exhibits outstanding reversible capacity (350.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (162.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;term cycling capability (186.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles), and reliable operation in flexible full KIBs, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal chalcogenides&#8208;based devices. Experimental and theoretical investigations attribute this high performance to the synergistic effect of the A/C&#8208;Re2Te5 with a built&#8208;in electric field and the elastic MXene, enabling improved pseudocapacitive contribution, accelerated charge transfer behavior, and high K+ ion adsorption/diffusion ability. Meanwhile, a combination of intercalation and conversion reactions mechanism is observed within A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene. This work offers a new approach for developing metal tellurides&#8208; and MXene&#8208;based anodes for achieving stable cyclability and fast&#8208;charging KIBs.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Nano&#8208;Antibiotics Enhanced Survival in Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Escherichia coli Sepsis by Precise Periplasmic EcDsbA Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise targeting of potential targets in bacterial periplasm is significant for the development of new antibacterial drugs. A class of heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics is developed to overcome multidrug resistance by targeting DsbA. Its cross&#8208;bacterial outer membrane barriers, triggers deformation in situ to inhibit DsbA activity. It further inhibits &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity, thereby restoring antibiotic sensitivity to kill bacteria.








Abstract
Disulfide bond (Dsb) proteins, especially DsbA, represent a promising but as&#8208;yet&#8208;unrealized target in combating multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria because their precise subcellular targeting through multibarrier remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics (NCefoTs) is proposed, through the co&#8208;assembly of enzyme&#8208;inhibiting lipopeptides (ELp component), membrane&#8208;recognizing and disrupting lipopeptides (MLp component), and cefoperazone. The self&#8208;sorting components of MLp&#160;&#8220;concentrated island&#8208;liked clusters&#8221;&#160;on the surface of NCefoTs promote the efficient penetration of NCefoTs through the outer membrane. Triggered by the DsbA, the precisely spatiotemporal engineered NCefoTs transform to nanofibers in&#160;situ and further significantly enhance the inhibition of DsbA. The hydrolytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamase and the motility function of flagella are thereby impeded, confirming the efficacy of NCefoTs in restoring susceptibility to antibiotics and inhibiting infection dissemination. By these synergistic effects of NCefoTs, the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics&#160;decreases from over 300 &#181;M to 1.56 &#181;M for clinically isolated E. coli MDR. The survival rate of sepsis&#8208;inflicted mice is significantly enhanced from 0% to 92% upon encapsulation of cefoperazone in NCefoTs, which rapidly eliminates invading pathogens and mitigates inflammation. The universally applicable delivery system, based on an &#8220;on demands&#8221; strategy, presents a promising prospect for undruggable antibiotic targets in the periplasm to combat MDR bacteria.

         <title>Open&#8208;Source Throttling of CD8+ T Cells in Brain with Low&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Guided Sequential Delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and aPD&#8208;L1 for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>

An &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy for CD8+ T cells aims to enhance immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM). Low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) guids the sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce T cell exhaustion (Tex), offering a promising strategy for brain tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Improving clinical immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) relies on addressing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and preventing its exhaustion holds promise for effective GBM immunotherapy. Here, a low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)&#8208;guided sequential delivery strategy is developed to enhance CD8+ T cells infiltration and activity in the GBM region. The sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce their exhaustion is termed an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy. Consequently, up to 3.39&#8208;fold of CD8+ T cells are observed with LIFU&#8208;guided sequential delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1), compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapeutic efficacy is substantially enhanced by the reversed immunosuppressive TME due to the expansion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory establishment in orthotopic GBM mice. Overall, LIFU&#8208;guided sequential cytokine and ICIs delivery offers an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy of CD8+ T cells, which may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic&#8208;Microbial Biohybrid for Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial biohybrid is proposed with Azotobacter Vinelandii (A. Vinelandii) interfaced directly on polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA) for artificial N2 fixation. The rationally designed biohybrid of NiO@PDA/A. Vinelandii biohybrid achieves a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 4.14 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) conversion to ammonia (NH3) in a mild condition is a big chemical challenge. The whole&#8208;cell diazotrophs based biological NH3 synthesis is one of the most promising strategies. Herein, the first attempt of photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial (PEC&#8208;MB) biohybrid is contributed for artificial N2 fixation, where Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii) is interfaced directly with polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA). By virtue of excellent bio&#8208;adhesive activity, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility of PDA layer, abundant A. vinelandii are effectively adsorbed on NiO@PDA to form NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid, and the rationally designed biohybrid achieved a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 1.85&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1/108 cells (4.14&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). In addition, this biohybrid can operate both under illumination with a PEC model or in dark with an electrocatalytic (EC) model to implement long&#8208;term and successional NH3 synthesis. The enhancement mechanism of NH3 synthesis in NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid can be ascribed to the increase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8208;hydrogen (NADH) and adenosine 5&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and over expression of nitrogen&#8208;fixing genes of nifH, nifD and nifK in nitrogenase. This innovative PEC&#8208;MB biohybrid strategy sheds light on the fundamental mechanism and establishes proof of concept of biotic&#8208;abiotic photosynthetic systems for sustainable chemical production.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conversion to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in a mild condition is a big chemical challenge. The whole-cell &lt;i&gt;diazotrophs&lt;/i&gt; based biological NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis is one of the most promising strategies. Herein, the first attempt of photoelectrochemical-microbial (PEC-MB) biohybrid is contributed for artificial N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, where &lt;i&gt;Azotobacter vinelandii&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;A. vinelandii&lt;/i&gt;) is interfaced directly with polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA). By virtue of excellent bio-adhesive activity, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility of PDA layer, abundant &lt;i&gt;A. vinelandii&lt;/i&gt; are effectively adsorbed on NiO@PDA to form NiO@PDA/&lt;i&gt;A. vinelandii&lt;/i&gt; biohybrid, and the rationally designed biohybrid achieved a record-high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production yield of 1.85&lt;sup&gt;&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cells (4.14&#160;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, this biohybrid can operate both under illumination with a PEC model or in dark with an electrocatalytic (EC) model to implement long-term and successional NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. The enhancement mechanism of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis in NiO@PDA/&lt;i&gt;A. vinelandii&lt;/i&gt; biohybrid can be ascribed to the increase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-hydrogen (NADH) and adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and over expression of nitrogen-fixing genes of &lt;i&gt;nif&lt;/i&gt;H, &lt;i&gt;nif&lt;/i&gt;D and &lt;i&gt;nif&lt;/i&gt;K in nitrogenase. This innovative PEC-MB biohybrid strategy sheds light on the fundamental mechanism and establishes proof of concept of biotic-abiotic photosynthetic systems for sustainable chemical production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Driven Semipermeable Nanoreactors for Enzymatic Cascade&#8208;Mediated Cancer Combination Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a novel type of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicle nanoreactors driven by coacervation, targeting hepatic cancer for delivery of enzyme drugs and sorafenib, which promotes cancer cell ferroptosis and apoptosis, is prepared. This approach not only curbes tumor growth but also activates immune responses, presenting a potent, multipronged cancer therapy strategy.








Abstract
Utilizing enzyme cascades as a promising approach for targeted cancer therapies holds significant potential, yet its clinical effectiveness is substantially hindered by functional losses during delivery. Complex coacervation emerges as an intriguing strategy for designing functional nanoreactors. In this study, a noteworthy achievement is presented in the development of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicles (HGS&#8208;PCVs) based on bioinspired homopolypeptoids, which serve as a facile, intelligent, and highly efficient nanoreactor tunable for glucose oxidase, hemoglobin,&#160;and sorafenib (SRF) to hepatic cancer cells. The TME&#8208;responsive permeability of HGS&#8208;PCVs enables the selective entry of glucose into their interior, triggering an enzymatic cascade reaction within the tumor. This intricate process generates toxic hydroxyl radicals while concurrently lowering the pH. Consequently, this pH shift enhances the SRF release, effectively promoting ferroptosis and apoptosis in the target cancer cells. Further, the administration of the HGS&#8208;PCVs not only initiates immunogenic cell death but also plays a crucial role in inducing the maturation of dendritic cells within lymph nodes. It stimulates an adaptive T&#8208;cell response, a crucial mechanism that contributes to impeding the growth of distant tumors in vivo, demonstrating the promising potential of PCVs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Weakening the Space Charge Layer Effect Through Tethered Anion Electrolyte and Piezoelectric Effect Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the space charge layer dilemma, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL.








Abstract
The space charge layer (SCL) dilemma, caused by mobile anion concentration gradient and the rapid consumption of cations, is the fundamental reason for the generation of zinc dendrites, especially under high&#8208;rate discharge conditions. To address the issue, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. The ferroelectric materials PbTiO3 with extreme&#8208;high piezoelectric constant can spontaneously generate an internal electric field to accelerate the movement of zinc ions, and the polyanionic polymer AMPS&#8208;Zn can repel mobile anions and disrupt the anions concentration gradient by tethering anions. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL, thus suppressing the occurrence of zinc dendrites and parasitic side reactions. Consequently, an asymmetric cell using the PbTiO3@Zn demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 2900&#160;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 3450&#160;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Furthermore, the PbTiO3@Zn/I2 battery demonstrated an impressive capacity retention rate of 84.0% over 65000 cycles by employing a slender Zn anode.

         <title>A Recyclable Ionogel with High Mechanical Robustness Based on Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contradictory requirements of recyclability and robustness of ionogels are resolved by incorporating covalent adaptable networks (CANs), resulting in a closed&#8208;loop recyclable, elastic, tough, durable, and solvent&#8208;resistant ionogel. This ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical conditions and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing due to its recyclability.








Abstract
Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials for flexible electronics, with high ionic conductivity, low volatility, and mechanical stretchability. Recyclable ionogels are recently developed to address the sustainability crisis of current electronics, through the introduction of non&#8208;covalent bonds. However, this strategy sacrifices mechanical robustness and chemical stability, severely diminishing the potential for practical application. Here, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are incorporated into ionogels, where dynamic covalent crosslinks endow high strength (11.3&#160;MPa tensile strength), stretchability (2396% elongation at break), elasticity (energy loss coefficient of 0.055 at 100% strain), and durability (5000 cycles of 150% strain). The reversible nature of CANs allows the ionogel to be closed&#8208;loop recyclable for up to ten times. Additionally, the ionogel is toughened by physical crosslinks between conducting ions and polymer networks, breaking the common dilemma in enhancing mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. The ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical treatments and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing based on its recyclability. This study provides insights into improving the mechanical and electrical properties of ionogels toward functionally reliable and environmentally sustainable bioelectronics.

         <title>Unveiling Contact&#8208;Electrification Effect on Interfacial Water Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration layers near solid surfaces are essential in physicochemical reactions. Contact electrification can alter the hydration layer structure through electrostatic interactions. The oscillation of interfacial water induced by contact electrification resembles that caused by electrochemical processes, offering new insights and evidence for chemically induced changes.








Abstract
Water is crucial for various physicochemical processes at the liquid&#8211;solid interfaces. In particular, the interfacial water, mediating the electric field and solvation effect along with the solid, corporately determine the electrochemical properties. Understanding the interaction between solid properties and the interface water holds significant importance in interfacial dynamics. However, the impact of alterations in the charged state of solid surfaces induced by contact electrification on interfacial water remains unknown. Here, the evolution of atomic&#8208;level resolution maps of hydration layers are reported on charged surfaces using 3D atomic force microscopy (3D&#8208;AFM). These findings demonstrate that electrostatic interactions can reinforce, distort, or collapse the characteristic structure of hydration layers. More importantly, these interactions exhibit interlayer differences and sample specificity in hydration layer structures of different substrates. In addition, similar oscillations of the hydration layer are observed at the electrochemical interface under different voltage biases. This suggests that contact&#8208;electrification has the potential to serve as a novel method for manipulating and regulating chemical reactions at the interface.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Structuring of Silica&#8208;Based Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Multicomponent Glasses with Adjustable Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically curable silicate&#8208;based nanocomposites containing photoreactive precursors allow transparent multicomponent glasses with adjustable properties to be fabricated. After lithographic structuring, the doped nanocomposites are thermally debinded and sintered in order to achieve full densification. This enables the production of complex structured, transparent multicomponent glasses that are difficult to realize using conventional methods.








Abstract
Silicate&#8208;based multicomponent glasses are of high interest for technical applications due to their tailored properties, such as an adaptable refractive index or coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the production of complex structured parts is associated with high effort, since glass components are usually shaped from high&#8208;temperature melts with subsequent mechanical or chemical postprocessing. Here for the first time the fabrication of binary and ternary multicomponent glasses using doped nanocomposites based on silica nanoparticles and photocurable metal oxide precursors as part of the binder matrix is presented. The doped nanocomposites are structured in high resolution using UV&#8208;casting and additive manufacturing techniques, such as stereolithography and two&#8208;photon lithography. Subsequently, the composites are thermally converted into transparent glass. By incorporating titanium oxide, germanium oxide, or zirconium dioxide into the silicate glass network, multicomponent glasses are fabricated with an adjustable refractive index nD between 1.4584&#8211;1.4832 and an Abbe number V of 53.85&#8211;61.13. It is further demonstrated that by incorporating 7&#160;wt% titanium oxide, glasses with ultralow thermal expansion can be fabricated with so far unseen complexity. These novel materials enable for the first time high&#8208;precision lithographic structuring of multicomponent silica glasses with applications from optics and photonics, semiconductors as well as sensors.

         <title>Fluid&#8208;Induced Piezoelectric Field Enhancing Photo&#8208;Assisted Zn&#8211;Air Batteries Based on a Fe@P(V&#8208;T) Microhelical Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the piezoelectric effect of the microhelical cathode poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) under the weak force of water flow, the built&#8208;in electric field can continuously promote the carrier separation and transfer of photocathode through the periodic piezoelectric potential, and effectively accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics, providing a constructive guidance for the development of piezoelectric&#8208;photo coupled assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries can accelerate the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER); however, challenges such as rapid charge carrier recombination and continuous electrolyte evaporation remain. Herein, for the first time, piezoelectric catalysis is introduced in a photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery to improve carrier separation capability and accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics of the photoelectric cathode. The designed microhelical catalyst exploits simple harmonic vibrations to regenerate the built&#8208;in electric field continuously. Specifically, in the presence of the low&#8208;frequency kinetic energy that occurs during water flow, the piezoelectric&#8211;photocoupling catalyst of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) is periodically deformed, generating a constant reconfiguration of the built&#8208;in electric field that separates photogenerated electrons and holes continuously. Further, on exposure to microvibrations, the gap between the charge and discharge potentials of the Fe@P(V&#8208;T)&#8208;based photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is reduced by 1.7 times compared to that without piezoelectric assistance, indicating that piezoelectric catalysis is highly effective for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a thorough understanding of coupling piezoelectric polarization and photo&#8208;assisted strategy in the field of energy storage and opens a fresh perspective for the investigation of multi&#8208;field coupling&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Free &#8220;Triboelectric Immunotherapy&#8221; Activating Immunity for Osteomyelitis Treatment and Recurrence Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug &#8208;free strategy, namely &#8220;triboelectric immunotherapy&#8221; based on pulsed direct&#8208;current output triboelectric nanogenerators (DC&#8208;TENG) is developed, based on coupling tribological charging effect and electrostatic breakdown effect, performing antibacterial, osteogenic, and immune activation effects for osteomyelitis. This triboelectric immunotherapy features efficient infection elimination and specific secondary recurrence prevention, with innate and adaptive immune&#8208;response activation, and prolonged immunological memory production.








Abstract
Treatment of osteomyelitis is clinically challenging with low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Existing therapies are limited by drug concentration and single regulatory effect on the immune network, and emphasize the role of anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in reducing osteoclast rather than the role of proinflammatory effects in accelerating infection clearance, which is not conducive to complete bacteria elimination and recurrence prevention. Herein, a direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (DC&#8208;TENG) is established to perform antibacterial effects and modulate immunological properties of infectious microenvironments of osteomyelitis through electrical stimulation, namely triboelectric immunotherapy. Seeing from the results, the triboelectric immunotherapy successfully activates polarization to proinflammatory (M1) macrophages in vitro, accompanied by satisfying direct antibacterial effects. The antibacterial and osteogenic abilities of triboelectric immunotherapy are verified in rat cranial osteomyelitis models. The effects on the polarization and differentiation of immune&#8208;related cells in vivo are investigated by establishing in situ tibial osteomyelitis models and immunosurveillance models in C57 mice respectively, indicating the ability of activating immunity and producing immunological memory for in situ infection and secondary recurrence, thus accelerating healing and preventing relapse. This study provides an efficient, long&#8208;acting, multifunctional, and wearable triboelectric immunotherapy strategy for drug&#8208;free osteomyelitis treatment systems.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Operated Widget (GLOW) for Closed&#8208;Loop Optogenetic Glycemic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces GLOWi&#946;, a closed&#8208;loop insulin&#8208;release system combining optogenetics and synthetic biology for diabetes management. Alginate microbeads encapsulating engineered i&#946;&#8208;cells and a probe that emits glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue fluorescence enable precise control of insulin release. Successfully tested in a T1D mouse model, this approach has potential for personalized diabetes treatment.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop control systems for precise control of therapeutic gene expression are promising candidates for personalized treatment of chronic ailments such as diabetes. Pancreatic i&#946;&#8208;cells are engineered with blue&#8208;light&#8208;inducible melanopsin to drive rapid insulin release by vesicular secretion from intracellular stores. In this work, a glucose&#8208;operated widget (GLOW) is designed as a component of a closed&#8208;loop control system for diabetes treatment by employing a probe that emits blue fluorescence in a glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent manner as a real&#8208;time glucose sensor to precisely control insulin release from these i&#946;&#8208;cells. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the complete control system, the probe is encapsulated together with i&#946;&#8208;cells in alginate&#8208;poly&#8208;(L&#8208;lysine) hydrogel&#8208;microbeads(400&#160;&#181;m in diameter and containing about 500 cells) called GLOWi&#946; (GLOW with i&#946;&#8208;cells), are subcutaneously implanted into type&#8208;1&#8208;diabetic (T1D) mice. Illumination by UV&#8208;A light at 390&#160;nm results in glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue&#8208;light emission from the probe at 445&#160;nm that in turn induces glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent insulin release from the i&#946;&#8208;cells in a fully reversible manner. Activation of the injected GLOWi&#946; at 390&#160;nm for 15 min effectively restores normoglycemia within 60&#8211;120 min in a closed&#8208;loop manner in these diabetic mice. The system is robust, as normoglycemia is well maintained by daily activation for at least 7 days.

         <title>Hole Polaron&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination Triggers Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon effect in a locally disordered structure near the pores in KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets accelerates the formation of active hole polarons, effectively preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons under mild conditions. The atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate superior nitrogenoxidation performance, producing nitrate at a rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
In the pursuit of successful photocatalytic transformations, challenges persist due to limitations in charge carrier utilization and transfer efficiency, which stemming from rapid recombination. Overcoming these limitations necessitates the exploration of novel mechanisms that enhance the effective separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Herein, deviating from the conventional approach of enhancing carrier migration to separate photogenerated charges and extend their lifetime, the proposal is to directly prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes by forming hole polarons. Specifically, disordered pores are introduced on the surface of KTaO3 ultrathin sheets, and the clear&#8208;cut evidences in electron paramagnetic resonance, photoluminescence, and ultrafast spectroscopy unambiguously confirm the enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon coupling, which results in the formation of hole polarons to impede the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Taking the challenging nitrogen oxidation reaction as an example, it is found that the hole polarons in atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets trigger outstanding photo&#8208;oxidation performance of&#160; nitrogen (N2)to nitrate, with a nitrate&#8208;producing rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This scenario is undoubtedly applicable to a wide variety of photocatalytic reactions due to the common challenge of charge carrier recombination in all photocatalytic processes, manifesting broad implications for promoting photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and Tough Ionogels via Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Dissipating Cross&#8208;Linking</title>

Herein, a chemical design of low&#8208;hysteresis and tough ionogels by utilizing low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating yet strong hierarchical nanoarchitectures as cross&#8208;linkers formed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is proposed. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the low&#8208;hysteresis features can serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance ionogels and will facilitate their advancement and application in many burgeoning fields.








Abstract
Low&#8208;hysteresis merits can help polymeric gel materials survive from consecutive loading cycles and promote life span in many burgeoning areas. However, it is a big challenge to design low&#8208;hysteresis and tough polymeric gel materials, especially for ionogels. This can be attributed to the fact that higher viscosities of ionic liquids (ILs) would increase chain friction of polymeric gels and eventually dissipate large amounts of energy under deformation. Herein, a chemical design of ionogels is proposed to achieve low&#8208;hysteresis characteristics in both mechanical and electric aspects via hierarchical aggregates formed by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of quadruple H&#8208;bonds in a soft IL&#8208;rich polymeric matrix. These self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates not only can greatly reinforce the polymeric matrix and enhance resilience, but also exhibit low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating features under stress conditions, simultaneously benefiting for low&#8208;hysteresis properties. These aggregates can also promote toughness and subsequent anti&#8208;fatigue properties in response to external cyclic mechanical stimuli. More importantly, these ionogels are presented as a model system to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the low hysteresis and fatigue resistance. Based on these findings, it is further demonstrated that the supramolecular low&#8208;hysteresis strategy is universal.

         <title>Porous Magnetic Soft Grippers for Fast and Gentle Grasping of Delicate Living Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is designed to address the inherent trade&#8208;off between shape adaptability and payload capacity. The porous structure imparts low impact force and high surface friction, enabling swift yet gentle grasping. PMSGs are integrated with robotic arms and UAVs for the remote gripping and transportation of small animals.








Abstract
Magnetic soft grippers have attracted intensive interest due to their untethered controllability, rapid response, and biological safety. However, manipulating living objects requires a simultaneous increase in shape adaptability and gripping force, which are typically mutually exclusive. Increasing the magnetic particle content enhances the magnetic strength but also increases the elastic modulus, leading to low adaptability and high impact force. Here, a porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is developed by integrating a porous structure into a magnetic silicone elastomer. The design of porous hard magnetic composite is characterized by high magnetization, low modulus, and rough surface. It offers the PMSG good compliance, high gripping force, and low impact force at fast gripping. The PMSG is capable of performing a variety of tasks, including the fast and gentle grasping of delicate living objects. The study provides insight into the design of novel magnetic grippers and may offer a promising outlook for biomedical or scientific applications in the manipulation of delicate organisms.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Single&#8208;Crystal Mesoporous TiO2 Supported CuW6O24 Clusters as Photocatalytic Cascade Nanoreactor for Boosting Reduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 based nanoreactors are prepared via the droplet interfacial oriented assembly and crystallisation strategy. The CuW6O24 &#160;cluster incorporated cascade nanoreactor are further constructed and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction with a high CH4 electron selectivity up to 94.3%. 








Abstract
Constructing nanoreactors with multiple active sites in well&#8208;defined crystalline mesoporous frameworks is an effective strategy for tailoring photocatalysts to address the challenging of CO2 reduction. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 nanorod (MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs, &#8776;110&#160;nm in length, high surface area of 117 m2 g&#8722;1, and uniform mesopores of &#8776;7.0&#160;nm) based nanoreactors are prepared via a droplet interface directed&#8208;assembly strategy under mild condition. By regulating the interfacial energy, the 1&#8208;D mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 can be further tuned to polycrystalline fan&#8208; and flower&#8208;like morphologies with different oxygen vacancies (Ov). The integration of single&#8208;crystal nature and mesopores with exposed oxygen vacancies make the rod&#8208;like TiO2 nanoreactors exhibit a high&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity to CO (95.1%). Furthermore, photocatalytic cascade nanoreactors by in situ incorporation of CuW6O24 (W&#8211;Cu) clusters onto MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs via Ov are designed and synthesized, which improved the CO2 adsorption capacity and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8211;CO&#8211;CH4 photoreduction. The second step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction induced by W&#8211;Cu sites ensures a high generation rate of CH4 (420.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), along with an enhanced CH4 selectivity (&#8776;94.3% electron selectivity). This research provides a platform for the design of mesoporous single&#8208;crystal materials, which potentially extends to a range of functional ceramics and semiconductors for various applications.

A &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; coating is fabricated via an in situ conversion strategy, consisting of a VSe2/ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch and a nano metallic V inner layer with corrosion resistance. This design not only facilitates interfacial ion transfer and electric field homogenization but also enables planar deposition, thereby achieving reversible and uniform zinc deposition.








Abstract
Owing to the considerable capacity, high safety, and abundant zinc resources, zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been garnering much attention. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory cyclic lifespan and poor reversibility originate from side reactions and dendrite obstacles to their practical applications. In addition to inhibiting the corrosion of aqueous electrolytes, regulating planar deposition is a key strategy to enhance their long&#8208;term stability. Herein, an in situ conversion strategy is reported to construct a protective &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; structure (VZSe/V@Zn) on zinc metal, consisting of the VSe2&#8208;ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch to Zn (002) plane, and corrosion&#8208;resistant nanometallic V inner layer. Such design integrates superior interfacial ionic/electronic transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation capability. The as&#8208;prepared VZSe/V@Zn demonstrates remarkable durability of 238&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a high depth of discharge (68.3% DOD) in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell. Even in the anode&#8208;free system, the as&#8208;prepared protective layer can extend the cycle life up to 2000 cycles, with an outstanding capacity retention of 93.1% and ultra&#8208;high average coulombic efficiency of 99.998%. This work delineates an effective strategy for fabricating lattice&#8208;matching protective layers, with profound implications for elucidating zinc deposition mechanisms and paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.

         <title>Manipulating the Electronic Properties of an Fe Single Atom Catalyst via Secondary Coordination Sphere Engineering to Provide Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>

Herein, an approach to access atomically dispersed Fe sites over a defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix via secondary coordination sphere engineering is reported on. This Fe catalyst presents extraordinary oxygen bifunctional activity in alkaline environments. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies manifest that the unique geometric and coordination structures reshape the electronic properties of Fe sites to afford such high performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are two key processes in electrochemical energy conversion technologies. Synthesis of nonprecious metal, carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen bifunctional activity and stability is a crucial, yet challenging step to achieving electrochemical energy conversion. Here, an approach to address this issue: synthesis of an atomically dispersed Fe electrocatalyst (Fe1/NCP) over a porous, defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support, is described. Through incorporation of a phosphorus atom into the second coordination sphere of iron, the activity and durability boundaries of this catalyst are pushed to an unprecedented level in alkaline environments, such as those found in a zinc&#8208;air battery. The rationale is to delicately incorporate P heteroatoms and defects close to the central metal sites (FeN4P1&#8208;OH) in order to break the local symmetry of the electronic distribution. This enables suitable binding strength with oxygenated intermediates. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that these synergetic interactions are responsible for high bifunctional activity and stability. These intrinsic advantages of Fe1/NCP enable a potential gap of a mere 0.65&#160;V and a high power density of 263.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 when incorporated into a zinc&#8208;air battery. These findings underscore the importance of design principles to access high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for green energy technologies.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Toward Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;free mesoporous NiO catalyst with a favorable local reaction environment is reported to catalyze selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2%. The C&#8722;C bond forms via the direct coupling of *CO2&#8208;COOH on NiO, which transforms to ethanol energetically through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The findings provide a new perspective of C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis, distinctive from that on Cu catalysts.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 offers a sustainable route to generate synthetic fuels. Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been developed to produce value&#8208;added C2+ alcohols; however, the limited understanding of complex C&#8722;C coupling and reaction pathway hinders the development of efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols catalysts. Herein, a Cu&#8208;free, highly mesoporous NiO catalyst, derived from the microphase separation of a block copolymer,&#160;is reported, which achieves selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus RHE. The dense mesopores create a favorable local reaction environment with CO2&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;deficient interfaces, suppressing hydrogen evolution and maximizing catalytic activity of NiO for CO2 reduction. Importantly, the C1&#8208;feeding experiments, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations consistently show that the direct coupling of *CO2 and *COOH is responsible for C&#8722;C bond formation on NiO, and subsequent reduction of *CO2&#8208;COOH to ethanol is energetically facile through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The unconventional C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on NiO, in contrast to the *CO dimerization on Cu, is triggered by strong CO2 adsorption on the polarized Ni2+&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. The work not only demonstrates a highly selective Cu&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based alternative for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols transformation but also provides a new perspective on C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis.

         <title>Five Volts Lithium Batteries with Advanced Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes: A Rational Design via a Trio&#8208;Functional Addon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced electrolyte is designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes with hierarchical DFOB&#8208; and PF6&#8208; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation, thus forming a robust and highly stable SEI and CEI. A 5V Li||LNMO cell with advanced electrolyte achieves&#160;88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries paired with high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathodes are a promising energy storage source for achieving enhanced high energy density. Forming durable and robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and the ability to withstand oxidation at high potentials are essential for long&#8208;lasting performance. Herein, advanced electrolytes are designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes for 5&#160;V Li||LNMO and graphite||LNMO cells achieving 88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that adding adiponitrile facilitates the presence of more hierarchical DFOB&#8722; and PF6&#8722; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation. By combining both fluorine and nitrile additives, an efficient synergistic effect is obtained, generating robust thin inorganic SEI and CEI films, respectively. These films enhance microstructural stability; Li dendrite growth on the Li electrode is being suppressed at the anode side and transition&#8208;metals dissolution from the cathode is being mitigated, as evidenced by cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron studies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) enable tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors for both T cells and macrophages. Consequently, PMMNPs not only enhance the antitumoral immunity of macrophages and T cells but also foster antitumoral synergy between these cells. This synergy is achieved by promoting tumor antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation, and inducing the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype.








Abstract
T cells and macrophages have the potential to collaborate to eliminate tumor cells efficiently. Macrophages can eliminate tumor cells through phagocytosis and subsequently activate T cells by presenting tumor antigens. The activated T cells, in turn, can kill tumor cells and redirect tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward an antitumoral M1 phenotype. However, checkpoint molecules expressed on tumor cells impede the collaborative action of these immune cells. Meanwhile, monotherapy with a single immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for either macrophages or T cells yields suboptimal efficacy in cancer patients. To address this challenge, here a nanoparticle capable of efficiently delivering dual ICIs to tumors for both macrophages and T cells is developed. These programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) can target tumors and provide signal&#8208;regulatory protein alpha and PD&#8208;1 to block CD47 and programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), respectively, on tumor cells. PMMNPs enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation, promote T cell activation, and induce the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype. In syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice, PMMNPs demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy compared to nanoparticles delivering single ICIs and non&#8208;targeted delivery of anti&#8208;CD47 and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. PMMNPs capable of augmenting the antitumoral interplay between macrophages and T cells may offer a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Closed&#8208;Loop Nanosystem Based on Piezoelectric Sensor and Pd&#8208;Nanoshell Photothermal Ablation for Renal Denervation to Treat Hypertension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing precise, effective, and safe renal denervation (RDN) is crucial for hypertension treatment. Here, the authors construct a closed&#8208;loop system based on a sensing unit of piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensors and a therapeutic unit of photothermal Pd&#160;nanoparticle shell. This nanosystem is capable of monitoring, targeting, and guiding ablation to safely achieve long&#8208;term control of renal sympathetic nerve&#8208;related hypertension.








Abstract
Renal sympathetic nerves play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and renal denervation (RDN) is a new solution for patients with refractory hypertension. However, current RDN techniques show inconsistent results in clinical application probably owing to incomplete endovascular ablation of the sympathetic nerves and a lack of measures to localize and assess efficacy. In this study, a closed&#8208;loop RDN system consisting of a sensing unit with a piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensor (PTFS) and a treatment unit with a hollow Pd nanoparticle shell (PdNPS) with a diameter of 202.0&#160;nm for photothermal neural ablation is constructed. The PTFS can monitor and collect arterial pulsation and blood pressure (BP) and direct PdNPS to maximize RDN. PdNPS maintains a local temperature of 58&#8211;62&#160;&#176;C under near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II irradiation (1,064&#160;nm) to achieve effective RDN within a range of 90&#8211;120&#160;s treatment window. Photothermal ablation significantly inhibits the activities of renal sympathetic nerves post&#8208;procedure and after one month and reduces the elevation of BP by &gt; 50%. The novel closed&#8208;loop system enables safe and efficient targeting, dynamic monitoring, and ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves. This closed&#8208;loop system provides a new strategy for RDN technology and even for treating sympathetic nerve&#8208;related chronic diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Molecular Dipole Enables Tunable Interfacial Field Toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fluorine terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules is investigated to engineer interfacial properties. Through the tunable interfacial field via tailored side&#8208;chain, a gradient energy level alignment with more favorable energetics is established, and the resulting N&#8208;i&#8208;P perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record high efficiency value of 25.47% together with enhanced long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
The interfacial management in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including mitigating the carrier transport barrier and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, still remains a significant challenge for efficiency and stability enhancement. Herein, by screening a family of fluorine (F) terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules, the study aims to gain insight into the molecular dipole array toward tunable interfacial field. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that these functional interfacial dipole molecules can effectively anchor on perovskite surface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction. In addition, the tailored side&#8208;chain with terminated F atoms allows for altering and constructing a well matched perovskite/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interfacial contact. As a result, the inserting dual&#8208;site organic dipole array effectively modulates the interface to deliver a gradient energy level alignment, facilitating carrier extraction and transport. The optimal dual&#8208;site dipole trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonamide mediated N&#8208;i&#8208;P PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 25.47%, together with enhanced operational stability under 1000&#160;h of the simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination exposure. These findings are believed to provide insight into the design of dual&#8208;site molecular dipole with sufficient interfacial tunability for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Microfluidic Platform for Generating and Releasing Patient&#8208;Derived Cancer Organoids with Diverse Shapes: Insight into Shape&#8208;Dependent Tumor Growth</title>

ReSCUE (Recoverable&#8208;Spheroid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip with Unrestricted External Shape), a multi&#8208;layer microfluidic platform that facilitates the generation and selective release of uniformly sized soft matter structures, including organoids and tumoroids is introduced. This platform allows for targeted recovery and in&#8208;depth analysis of breast cancer patient&#8208;derived organoids (PDOs), enabling investigations into how tumor morphology influences tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation.








Abstract
Multicellular spheroids and patient&#8208;derived organoids find many applications in fundamental research, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. Advances in the understanding and recapitulation of organ functionality and disease development require the generation of complex organoid models, including organoids with diverse morphologies. Microfluidics&#8208;based cell culture platforms enable time&#8208;efficient confined organoid generation. However, the ability to form organoids with different shapes with a subsequent transfer from microfluidic devices to unconstrained environments for studies of morphology&#8208;dependent organoid growth is yet to be demonstrated. Here, a microfluidic platform is introduced that enables high&#8208;fidelity formation and addressable release of breast cancer organoids with diverse shapes. Using this platform, the impact of organoid morphology on their growth in unconstrained biomimetic hydrogel is explored. It is shown that proliferative cancer cells tend to localize in high positive curvature organoid regions, causing their faster growth, while the overall growth pattern of organoids with diverse shapes tends to reduce interfacial tension at the organoid&#8208;hydrogel interface. In addition to the formation of organoids with diverse morphologies, this platform can be integrated into multi&#8208;tissue micro&#8208;physiological systems.

         <title>Sliding Ferroelectricity Induced Ultrafast Switchable Photovoltaic Response in &#949;&#8208;InSe Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the odd&#8208;even layer&#8208;dependence of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#949;&#8208;InSe. The device based on the &#949;&#8208;InSe achieves an on/off ratio of 10&#8308; in ferroelectric tunneling junction and ultrafast bulk photovoltaic response in photodetector in the near&#8208;infrared band. Moreover, the photoresponse in &#949;&#8208;InSe can even exceed graphene in the same conditions, confirming the possibility of application in multifunctional devices.








Abstract
2D sliding ferroelectric semiconductors have greatly expanded the ferroelectrics family with the flexibility of bandgap and material properties, which hold great promise for ultrathin device applications that combine ferroelectrics with optoelectronics. Besides the induced different resistance states for non&#8208;volatile memories, the switchable ferroelectric polarizations can also modulate the photogenerated carriers for potentially ultrafast optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the room temperature sliding ferroelectricity can be used for ultrafast switchable photovoltaic response in &#949;&#8208;InSe layers. By first&#8208;principles calculations and experimental characterizations, it is revealed that the ferroelectricity with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) polarization only exists in even layer &#949;&#8208;InSe.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates the odd-even layer-dependence of out-of-plane ferroelectricity in &#949;-InSe. The device based on the &#949;-InSe achieves an on/off ratio of 10&#8308; in ferroelectric tunneling junction and ultrafast bulk photovoltaic response in photodetector in the near-infrared band. Moreover, the photoresponse in &#949;-InSe can even exceed graphene in the same conditions, confirming the possibility of application in multifunctional devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D sliding ferroelectric semiconductors have greatly expanded the ferroelectrics family with the flexibility of bandgap and material properties, which hold great promise for ultrathin device applications that combine ferroelectrics with optoelectronics. Besides the induced different resistance states for non-volatile memories, the switchable ferroelectric polarizations can also modulate the photogenerated carriers for potentially ultrafast optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the room temperature sliding ferroelectricity can be used for ultrafast switchable photovoltaic response in &#949;-InSe layers. By first-principles calculations and experimental characterizations, it is revealed that the ferroelectricity with out-of-plane (OOP) polarization only exists in even layer &#949;-InSe. The ferroelectricity is also demonstrated in &#949;-InSe-based vertical devices, which exhibit high on-off ratios (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) and non-volatile storage capabilities. Moreover, the OOP ferroelectricity enables an ultrafast (&#8776;3&#160;ps) bulk photovoltaic response in the near-infrared band, rendering it a promising material for self-powered reconfigurable and ultrafast photodetector. This work reveals the essential role of ferroelectric polarization on the photogenerated carrier dynamics and paves the way for hybrid multifunctional ferroelectric and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Minimalist Pathogen&#8208;Like Sugar Nanovaccine for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon chain&#8208;modified mannan, derived from yeast, demonstrates exceptional capabilities in antigen encapsulation and cross&#8208;presentation, coupled with enhanced activation of dendritic cells through the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, which leads to robust activation of antigen&#8208;specific T cells. When combined with anti&#8208;PD L1, this nanovaccine can unleash formidable antitumor immune responses, working synergistically to inhibit the growth of established tumors.








Abstract
Pathogen&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles have emerged at the forefront of vaccine delivery technology, offering potent immune activation and excellent biocompatibility. Among these innovative carriers, mannan, a critical component of yeast cell walls, shows promise as an exemplary vaccine carrier. Nevertheless, it faces challenges like unpredictable immunogenicity, rapid elimination, and limited antigen loading due to high water solubility. Herein, mannan with varying carbon chain ratios is innovatively modified, yielding a series of dodecyl chains modified mannan (Mann&#8208;C12). Through meticulous screening, a mannan variant with a 40% grafting ratio is pinpointed as the optimal vaccine carrier. Further RNA sequencing confirms that Mann&#8208;C12 exhibits desired immunostimulatory characteristics. Coupled with antigen peptides, Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280 nanovaccine initiates the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells by activating the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, significantly boosting antigen utilization and sparking antigen&#8208;specific immune responses. In vivo, experiments utilizing the B16&#8208;OVA tumor model underscore the exceptional preventive capabilities of Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280. Notably, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, it displays a profound synergistic effect, leading to marked inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, the work has yielded a pathogen&#8208;like nanovaccine that is both simple to prepare and highly effective, underscoring the vast potential of mannan&#8208;modified nanovaccines in the realm of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A &#8220;Two&#8208;Pronged&#8221; Strategy to Boost Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics on NiFe&#8208;Based (Oxy)hydroxides via Oxygen Deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe Coordinate Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Ampere&#8208;Level Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from excellent HER and oxygen evolution reaction activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits feasibility and practicability for industrial applications.








Abstract
NiFe (oxy)hydroxides have been regarded as one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics limit its application as bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline HER process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Consequently, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF delivers overpotentials as low as 25 and 234&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, benefiting from excellent HER and OER activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits a remarkable OWS activity with cell voltages of 1.44&#160;V and 1.77&#160;V at 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, and displays ultralong&#8208;term stability for 600&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while remaining durable for 300&#160;h in an alkaline water electrolyzer in 30% KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C. The calculated price per gallon of gasoline equivalent for the produced H2 is $ 0.92, which is much lower than 2026 U.S. Department of Energy target ($ 2.00), demonstrating feasibility and practicability of NFM&#8208;OVR/NF for industrial applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Multichannel Silk Nerve Conduits With Multicellular Spatiotemporal Distributions for Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions in its hierarchical channel structures is presented. It is further demonstrated in rats that the BNC@MSCs/SCs can facilitate nerve regeneration and function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).








Abstract
Bioengineered nerve conduits have shown great promise for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, while their practical values are limited by poor regenerative efficacy and lack of multi&#8208;level structural design. Here, inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (namely BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions for effective SCI repair is presented. The biomimetic silk nerve conduit (BNC) with hierarchical channels and aligned pore structures is prepared via a modified directional freeze&#8208;casting strategy. Such hierarchical structures provide appropriate space for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) settled in specific channels, which contributes to the generation of BNC@MSCs/SCs resembling the cellular spatiotemporal distributions of natural spinal cords. The in vitro results reveal the facilitated SC migration and MSC differentiation in such BNC@MSCs/SCs multicellular system, which further promotes the tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells as well as M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, BNC@MSCs/SCs can effectively promote the tissue repair and function recovery in SCI rats by attenuating glial scar formation while promoting neuron regeneration and myelin sheath reconstruction. Thus, it is believed that the biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduits with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions are valuable for SCI repair and other neural tissue regeneration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polysaccharide dually&#8208;tagged with tyrosine and triphenylphosphine is designed for targeted cross&#8208;linking of mitochondria in melanoma cells, effectively slowing down tumor metabolism and growth. Additionally, it promoted the production of artificial melanin and enhanced the photothermal conversion efficiency. These findings introduce a catalytic cross&#8208;linking strategy, offering a new avenue for controlling cellular metabolism combined with photothermal therapy for cancer treatment.

         <title>Sea Cucumber&#8208;Inspired Polyurethane Demonstrating Record&#8208;Breaking Mechanical Properties in Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sea cucumber&#8208;inspired polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized, which is instrumental in the creation of self&#8208;healing ionogels. The polyurethane forms dynamic hard&#8208;phase regions within the ionogels, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds. This unique phase separation structure not only significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the ionogels but also ensures their self&#8208;healing capability at room temperature.








Abstract
Practical applications of existing self&#8208;healing ionogels are often hindered by the trade&#8208;off between their mechanical robustness, ionic conductivity, and temperature requirements for their self&#8208;healing ability. Herein, this challenge is addressed by drawing inspiration from sea cucumber. A polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized and used to fabricate room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels with excellent mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, puncture resistance, and impact resistance. The hard segments of polyurethane, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds, coalesce into hard phase regions, which can efficiently dissipate energy through the reversible disruption and reformation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the resulting ionogels exhibit record&#8208;high tensile strength and toughness compared to other room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels. Furthermore, the inherent reversibility of multiple hydrogen bonds within the hard phase regions allows the ionogels to spontaneously and efficiently self&#8208;heal damaged mechanical properties and ionic conductivity multiple times at room temperature. To underscore their application potential, these ionogels are employed as electrolytes in the fabrication of electrochromic devices, which exhibit excellent and stable electrochromic performance, repeatable healing ability, and satisfactory impact resistance. This study presents a novel strategy for the fabrication of ionogels with exceptional mechanical properties and room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing capability.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Yet Sustainable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composite with MXene Segregated Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur&#160;generated from petroleum refining as a huge waste&#160;is upcycled to sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)&#160;and this new polymer is applied to construct a sustainable and high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENG output performance is maximized by introducing MXene segregated&#160;structure integrated sulfur&#8208;rich polymer/MXene composite. This TENG demonstrated 8.4 times higher peak power density than that of the previous record from SRP&#8208;based TENGs.









Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) typically employ fluoropolymers, highly negative chargeable materials in triboelectric series. However, many researchers nowadays are concerned about environmental pollution caused by poly&#8208;and per&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to their critical immunotoxicity as fluoropolymers are likely to release PFAS into the ecosystem during their life cycle. Herein, a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)/MXene composite, offering high&#8208;performance yet sustainable TENG is developed. Value&#8208;addition of sulfur into SRP&#8208;based TENG has huge advantages since sulfur is abundant waste from petroleum refining and possesses the highest electron affinity (&#8722;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) among polymerizable atoms. MXene segregated structure is introduced into SRP to achieve homogeneous distribution without electrical percolation by utilizing below 0.5&#160;wt% of MXene, resulting in a significantly enhanced dielectric constant without a drastic increase of dielectric loss. Due to homogeneous MXene distribution, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG demonstrates 2.9 times and 19.5 times enhances peak voltage and peak current compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs. Additionally, it exhibits reusability without critical reduction of modulus and TENG performance due to dynamically exchangeable disulfide bonds. Finally, after the corona discharging and scaling&#8208;up process to a 4&#8208;inch wafer size, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG exhibits an 8.4 times improvement in peak power density, reaching 3.80&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Cu/CuxO nanoparticles on graphdiyne (Cu/CuxO/GDY) with tandem catalytic mechanism is successfully designed. The Cu/CuxO/GDY catalyst exhibits high NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), revealing the enormous potentials of graphdiyne as a tandem catalyst to improve NO3RR kinetics and providing a new direction for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity toward NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction is presented. A high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst is achieved. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers develop an innovative coating for titanium implants that combats infections and promotes healing. By combining ultrasound&#8208;activated metal&#8208;organic frameworks and probiotics, the coating triggers bacterial death and immune responses, enhancing antibacterial and bone regeneration effects. This method shows promise for preventing implant&#8208;related infections and promoting recovery, representing a significant advancement in medical implants.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections (IAIs) are the main cause of prosthetic implant failure. Bacterial biofilms prevent antibiotic penetration, and the unique metabolic conditions in hypoxic biofilm microenvironment may limit the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment.

     alt="Ultrasound-Activated Probiotics Vesicles Coating for Titanium Implant Infections Through Bacterial Cuproptosis-Like Death and Immunoregulation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers develop an innovative coating for titanium implants that combats infections and promotes healing. By combining ultrasound-activated metal-organic frameworks and probiotics, the coating triggers bacterial death and immune responses, enhancing antibacterial and bone regeneration effects. This method shows promise for preventing implant-related infections and promoting recovery, representing a significant advancement in medical implants.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implant-associated infections (IAIs) are the main cause of prosthetic implant failure. Bacterial biofilms prevent antibiotic penetration, and the unique metabolic conditions in hypoxic biofilm microenvironment may limit the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment. Escaping survival bacteria may not be continually eradicated, resulting in the recurrence of IAIs. Herein, a sonosensitive metal-organic framework of Cu-TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) nanosheets and tinidazole doped probiotic-derived membrane vesicles (OMVs) with high-penetration sonodynamic therapy (SDT), bacterial metabolic state interference, and bacterial cuproptosis-like death to eradicate IAIs is proposed. The Cu-TCPP can convert O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to toxic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through SDT in the normoxic conditions, enhancing the hypoxic microenvironment and activating the antibacterial activity of tinidazole. The released Cu(II) under ultrasound can be converted to Cu(I) by exogenous poly(tannic acid) (pTA) and endogenous glutathione. The disruption of the bacterial membrane by SDT can enhance the Cu(I) transporter activity. Transcriptomics indicate that the SDT-enhanced Cu(I) overload and hypoxia-activated therapy hinder the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to bacterial cuproptosis-like death. Moreover, the OMVs-activated therapy can polarize macrophages to a M2-like phenotype and facilitate bone repair. The sonodynamic biofilm microenvironment modulation strategy, whereby the hypoxia-enhanced microenvironment is potentiated to synergize SDT with OMVs-activated therapy, provides an effective strategy for antibacterial and osteogenesis performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Throughput Characterization of Organic Thin Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. The autotester enables OTFT research acceleration within the large parameter spaces created by both diverse material roles and device architectures.








Abstract
Automation is vital to accelerating research. In recent years,&#160;the application of self&#8208;driving labs to materials discovery and device optimization has highlighted many benefits and challenges inherent to these new technologies. Successful automated workflows offer tangible benefits to fundamental science and industrial scale&#8208;up by significantly increasing productivity and reproducibility all while enabling entirely new types of experiments. However, it's implemtation is often time&#8208;consuming and cost&#8208;prohibitive and necessitates establishing multidisciplinary teams that bring together domain&#8208;specific knowledge with specific skillsets in computer science and engineering. This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; over the last 8 years by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. From wearable and stretchable electronics to next&#8208;generation sensors and displays, OTFTs have the potential to be a key technology that will enable new applications from health to aerospace. The combination of materials chemistry, device manufacturing, thin film characterization and electrical engineering makes OTFT research challenging due to the large parameter space created by both diverse material roles and device architectures. Consequently, this research stands to benefit enormously from automation. By leveraging the multidisciplinary team and taking a user&#8208;centered design approach in the design and continued improvement of the autotesters, the group has meaningfully increased productivity, explored research avenues impossible with traditional workflows, and developed as scientists and engineers capable of effectively designing and leveraging automation to build the future of their fields to encourage this approach, the files for replicating the infrastructure are included, and questions and potential
collaborations are welcomed.

         <title>High Sensitivity X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Degradation Based on Deuterated Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to achieve ultrasensitive and stable X&#8208;ray detectors through isotope engineering is developed. The ion migration of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite single crystals is significantly suppressed, achieving five times higher stability and X&#8208;ray detection performance. The progress of this paper provides a new route to accelerate the adoption of perovskites in X&#8208;ray imaging and medical applications.








Abstract
Methylammonium lead single crystal (MAPbI3 SC) possesses superior optoelectronic properties and low manufacturing cost, making it an ideal candidate for X&#8208;ray detection. However, the ionic migration of the perovskites usually leads to instability, dark current drift, and hysteresis of the detector, limiting their applications in well&#8208;established technologies. Here, a series of X&#8208;ray detectors of MAPbI3 SCs are reported with different degrees of deuteration (DxMAPbI3, x = 0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.99). By controlling the content of deuterium (D) in organic cations, the sensitivity, detection limits, ion migration, and resistivity of the detector can be controlled, thereby improving its performance. Due to stronger hydrogen bonds (N&#9472;D&#183;&#183;&#183;I), the ion activation energy significantly increases to 886 meV. Consequently, the D0.99MAPbI3 SC detector shows more than five&#8208;fold enhancement, achieving a record&#8208;high mobility&#8211;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product of 5.39&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 2.18 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under 120&#160;keV hard X&#8208;ray and a low detection limit of 4.8 nGyair s&#8722;1, as well as long&#8208;term stability. The study provides a straightforward strategy for constructing ultrasensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging systems based on perovskite SCs.

         <title>Scalable Layer&#8208;Controlled Oxidation of Bi2O2Se for Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristor Arrays With sub&#8208;pA Sneak Currents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable oxidation of single&#8208;crystal Bi2O2Se through the development of large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation allowed for the construction of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor exhibited remarkable self&#8208;rectifying memristive performance, including ultra&#8208;high ON/OFF and rectification ratios, and nonlinearity. The scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying memristor arrays is successfully demonstrated, showcasing sub&#8208;pA sneak currents, desirable to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays.








Abstract
Smart memristors with innovative properties are crucial for the advancement of next&#8208;generation information storage and bioinspired neuromorphic computing. However, the presence of significant sneak currents in large&#8208;scale memristor arrays results in operational errors and heat accumulation, hindering their practical utility. This study successfully synthesizes a quasi&#8208;free&#8208;standing Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystalline film and achieves layer&#8208;controlled oxidation by developing large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation, resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor demonstrates remarkable self&#8208;rectifying resistive switching performance (over 105 for ON/OFF and rectification ratios, as well as nonlinearity) in both nanoscale (through conductive atomic force microscopy) and microscale (through memristor array) regimes. Furthermore, the potential for scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor, achieving sub&#8208;pA sneak currents to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays is demonstrated. The memristors also exhibit ultrafast resistive switching (sub&#8208;100&#160;ns) and low power consumption (1.2 pJ) as characterized by pulse&#8208;mode testing. The findings suggest a synergetic effect of interfacial Schottky barriers and oxygen vacancy migration as the self&#8208;rectifying switching mechanism, elucidated through controllable &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 thickness modulation and theoretical ab initio calculations.

         <title>Precisely Tunable Instantaneous Carbon Rearrangement Enables Low&#8208;Working&#8208;Potential Hard Carbon Toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Energy Density</title>

Metastable hard carbon (HC) with precisely tunable graphitic micro&#8208;domains and closed nanopores is achieved through a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically controlled synthesis. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the optimal sample exhibiting a plateau capacity of 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the assembled HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery is therefore increased by 20.7%.








Abstract
As the preferred anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon (HC) confronts significant obstacles in providing a long and dominant low&#8208;voltage plateau to boost the output energy density of full batteries. The critical challenge lies in precisely enhancing the local graphitization degree to minimize Na+ ad&#8208;/chemisorption, while effectively controlling the growth of internal closed nanopores to maximize Na+ filling. Unfortunately, traditional high&#8208;temperature preparation methods struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Herein, a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is proposed that enables the creation of metastable HCs with precisely tunable carbon phases and low discharge/charge voltage plateaus. By optimizing the temperature and width of thermal pulses, the high&#8208;throughput screened HCs are characterized by short&#8208;range ordered graphitic micro&#8208;domains that possess accurate crystallite width and height, as well as appropriately&#8208;sized closed nanopores. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the best sample exhibiting a high plateau capacity of up to 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery can therefore be increased by 20.7%. Machine learning study explicitly unveils the &#8220;carbon phase evolution&#8722;electrochemistry&#8221; relationship. This work promises disruptive changes to the synthesis, optimization, and commercialization of HC anodes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Tomographic Imaging of Chemical Short&#8208;Range Atomic Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning enhanced approach is introduced to break the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography, and precisely image multiple arrangements of atoms associated with (non&#8208;) statistical chemical short&#8208;range order, in three dimensions, in CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloys with no prior knowledge of the presence of chemical short&#8208;range order or which type.








Abstract
In solids, chemical short&#8208;range order (CSRO) refers to the self&#8208;organization of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, it is showcased how machine learning&#8208;enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near&#8208;atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy. Multiple CSRO configurations are revealed, with their formation supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows establishing relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic&#8208;scale architectures.

         <title>Solvation Regulation Reinforces Anion&#8208;Derived Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The CIP solvated structure models with the faster kinetic process are established by introducing a multifunctional tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate initiator/additive in pDOL polymer system. A robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed for excellent reversibility of Li plating/stripping and superior quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer lithium metal batteries are an important strategy for achieving high safety and high energy density. However, the issue of Li dendrites and inherent inferior interface greatly restricts practical application. Herein, this study introduces tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate solvent with moderate solvation ability, which can not only complex with Li+ to promote the in&#8208;situ ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), but also build solvated structure models to explore the effect of different solvation structures in the polymer electrolyte. Thereinto, it is dominated by the contact ion pair solvated structure with pDOL chain segments forming less lithium bonds, exhibiting faster kinetic process and constructing a robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, which significantly improves the utilization rate of active Li and the high&#8208;voltage resistance of pDOL. As a result, it exhibits stable cycling at ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 in half cells, and an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 2000&#160;h in symmetric cells can be realized. Furthermore, matched with LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode, the capacity retention after 60 cycles is as high as 96.8% at N/P value of 3.33. Remarkably, 0.7 Ah Li||LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 pouch cell with an energy density of 461&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 can be stably cycled for five cycles at 100% depth of discharge.

         <title>Multidentate Fullerenes Enable Tunable and Robust Interfacial Bonding for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerenes on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Due to favorable energy level alignment and interface interactions, devices based on FM5 achieved a PCE of 15.05%, ranking among the top&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Improving the efficiency of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) is significantly hindered by energy level mismatch and weak interactions at the interface between the tin&#8208;based perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers (ETLs). In this study, four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerene molecules with 3, 4, 5, and 6 diethylmalonate groups, labeled as FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6 are synthesized, and employed as interfacial layers in TPSCs. It is observed that increasing the number of functional groups in these fullerenes leads to shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and enhance interfacial chemical interactions. Notably, FM5 exhibits a suitable energy level and robust interaction with the perovskite, effectively enhancing electron extraction and defect passivation. Additionally, the unique molecular structure of FM5 allows the exposed carbon cage to be tightly stacked with the upper fullerene cage after interaction with the perovskite, facilitating efficient charge transfer and protecting the perovskite from moisture and oxygen damage. As a result, the FM5&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 15.05%, significantly surpassing that of the PCBM&#8208;based (11.77%), FM3&#8208;based (13.54%), FM4&#8208;based (14.34%), and FM6&#8208;based (13.75%) devices. Moreover, the FM5&#8208;based unencapsulated device exhibits excellent stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after 300 h of air exposure.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Thermodynamic Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional crystallization control strategy by ingenious vapor design is developed for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The target perovskite films exhibit efficient energy transfer and minimized charge loss. Consequently, a series of red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with record peak external quantum efficiency over 32%, along with remarkable half&#8208;lifetime are obtained.








Abstract
Efficient and stable red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) demonstrate promising potential in high&#8208;definition displays and biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been made in device performance, meeting commercial demands remains a challenge in the aspects of long&#8208;term stability and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, an in situ crystallization regulation strategy is developed for optimizing red perovskite films through ingenious vapor design. Mixed vapor containing dimethyl sulfoxide and carbon disulfide (CS2) is incorporated to conventional annealing, which contributes to thermodynamics dominated perovskite crystallization for well&#8208;aligned cascade phase arrangement. Additionally, the perovskite surface defect density is minimized by the CS2 molecule adsorption. Consequently, the target perovskite films exhibit smooth exciton energy transfer, reduced defect density, and blocked ion migration pathways. Leveraging these advantages, spectrally stable red PeLEDs are obtained featuring emission at 668, 656, and 648&#160;nm, which yield record peak EQEs of 30.08%, 32.14%, and 29.04%, along with prolonged half&#8208;lifetimes of 47.7, 60.0, and 43.7&#160;h at the initial luminances of 140, 250, and 270&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for optimizing perovskite crystallization and represents a significant stride toward the commercialization of red PeLEDs.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Crystallization Regulation and Bulk Defect Passivation for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D porous channels and high crystalline orientation of imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) facilitate the crystallization and defect elimination of the perovskite film. The recombination of photogenerated carriers is thus reduced and the perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent efficiency and high stability.








Abstract
The low crystallinity of the perovskite layers and many defects at grain boundaries within the bulk phase and at interfaces are considered huge barriers to the attainment of high performance and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a robust photoelectric imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) is introduced to precisely control the perovskite crystallization process and effectively passivate defects at grain boundaries through a sequential deposition method. The 1D porous channels, abundant active sites, and high crystallization orientation of PyPor&#8208;COF offer advantages for regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and eliminating defects. Moreover, the intrinsic electronic characteristics of PyPor&#8208;COF endow a more closely matched energy level arrangement within the perovskite layer, which promotes charge transport and thereby suppresses the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The champion PSCs containing PyPor&#8208;COF achieved power conversion efficiencies of 24.10% (0.09 cm2) and 20.81% (1.0 cm2), respectively. The unpackaged optimized device is able to maintain its initial efficiency of 80.39% even after being exposed to air for 2000 h. The device also exhibits excellent heating stability and light stability. This work gives a new impetus to the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via employing COFs.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired, Self&#8208;Healing, Highly Effective Fully Polymeric Fire&#8208;Retardant Coatings Enabled by Group Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the multifunctions of mussel's catechol groups, here a pioneering &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy has been proposed to create a waterborne fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating that exhibits self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and superior fire protection for various substrates from polymer foams to steel structures. These results offer a promising design principle for creating high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings.









Abstract
Fire&#8208;retardant coatings represent a universal cost&#8208;effective approach to providing fire protection for various substrates without compromising substrates&#8217; bulk properties. However, it has been attractive yet highly challenging to create waterborne polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coatings combining high&#8208;efficiency, generally strong adhesion, and self&#8208;repairability due to a lack of rational design principles. Inspired by mussel's unique adhesive, self&#8208;healing, and char&#8208;forming mechanisms, herein, a &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy is proposed to realize the combination of self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and high efficiency in a fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating via multiple synergies between catechol, phosphonic, and hydroxyethyl groups. As&#8208;created fire&#8208;retardant coating exhibits a rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ability and strong adhesion to (non)polar substrates due to multiple dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions enabled by these groups. Because these functional groups enable the formation of a robust structurally intact yet slightly expanded char layer upon exposure to flame, a 200&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick such coating can make extremely flammable polystyrene foam very difficult to ignite and self&#8208;extinguishing, which far outperforms previous strategies. Moreover, this coating can provide universal exceptional fire protection for a variety of substrates from polymer foams, and timber, to fabric and steel. This work presents a promising material design principle to create next&#8208;generation sustainable high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings for general fire protection.

3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedles
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) are a modular platform for minimally invasive drug delivery into the skin. L&#8208;MAPs can deliver diverse payloads, with multiple cargo release profiles on a single patch. Release kinetics can be tuned as a function of needle geometry and cargo formulation. This platform opens up opportunities to scale up transdermal drug delivery. More details can be found in article number 2404606 by Netra Rajesh, Jillian Perry, Joseph DeSimone, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Quantitative in Vivo Molecular MRI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative molecular MRI is essential in preclinical research and drug development. This review aims to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of new tools for non&#8208;invasive quantitative imaging of biological processes.








Abstract
Molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combines chemistry, chemical biology, and imaging techniques to track molecular events non&#8208;invasively. Quantitative molecular MRI aims to provide meaningful, reproducible numerical measurements of molecular processes or biochemical targets within the body. In this review, the classifications of molecular MRI probes based on their signal&#8208;generating mechanism and functionality are first described. From there, the primary considerations for in vitro characterization and in vivo validation of molecular MRI probes, including how to avoid pitfalls and biases are discussed. Then, recommendations on imaging acquisition protocols and analysis methods to establish quantitative relationships between MRI signal change induced by the probes and the molecular processes of interest are provided. Finally, several representative case studies are highlighted that incorporate these features. Quantitative molecular MRI is a multidisciplinary research area incorporating expertise in chemical biology, inorganic chemistry, molecular probes, imaging physics, drug development, pathobiology, and medicine. The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes and methods in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of these new quantitative tools for non&#8208;invasive imaging of biological processes.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Controlled Partitioning of Biomolecules at Aqueous Interfaces and Their Bioanalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, an in&#8208;depth exploration of all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and their potential applications in bioanalytics is provided. The key concepts, such as affinity&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena,&#160; and associated applications including interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and biosensing, are comprehensively discussed. Challenges, particularly in stabilizing all&#8208;aqueous interfaces and handling low&#8208;volume samples, as well as future directions, including optimizing material compositions and refining protocols to advance the field, are also presented.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems play essential roles in bioanalytical and biochemical applications. Compared to conventional oil and organic solvent&#8208;based systems, these systems are characterized by their rich bulk and interfacial properties, offering superior biocompatibility. In particular, phase separation in all&#8208;aqueous systems facilitates the creation of compartments with specific physicochemical properties, and therefore largely enhances the accessibility of the systems. In addition, the all&#8208;aqueous compartments have diverse affinities, with an important property known as partitioning, which can concentrate (bio)molecules toward distinct immiscible phases. This partitioning affinity imparts all&#8208;aqueous interfaces with selective permeability, enabling the controlled enrichment of target (bio)molecules. This review introduces the basic principles and applications of partitioning&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena in a typical all&#8208;aqueous system, namely aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs); these applications include interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and assembly, as well as bio&#8208;sensing and detection. The primary challenges associated with designing all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and several future directions are also discussed, such as the stabilization of aqueous interfaces, the handling of low&#8208;volume samples, and exploration of suitable ATPSs compositions with the efficient protocol.
