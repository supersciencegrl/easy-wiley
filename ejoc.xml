      <title>Cover Feature: Can Heteroarenes/Arenes Be Hydrogenated Over Catalytic Pd/C Under Ambient Conditions? (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the exceptionally mild hydrogenation of aromatic compounds, including both heteroarenes and arenes, which was accomplished by using catalytic Pd/C with H2&#8208;balloon pressure at room temperature. As the representative reaction, pyridine was hydrogenated on 1 mol% Pd/C in AcOH to afford piperidine quantitatively. Substrate scope analysis and DFT calculations indicated that reaction rates are highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of substituents and the HOMO/LUMO states. Moreover, the usefulness and chemo&#8208;selectivity of the established reaction were demonstrated by the synthesis of the anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug donepezil. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Tanaka and T. Usuki.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the exceptionally mild hydrogenation of aromatic compounds, including both heteroarenes and arenes, which was accomplished by using catalytic Pd/C with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;balloon pressure at room temperature. As the representative reaction, pyridine was hydrogenated on 1 mol% Pd/C in AcOH to afford piperidine quantitatively. Substrate scope analysis and DFT calculations indicated that reaction rates are highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of substituents and the HOMO/LUMO states. Moreover, the usefulness and chemo&#8208;selectivity of the established reaction were demonstrated by the synthesis of the anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug donepezil.

      <dc:description>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. We demonstrate for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis.

      <dc:description>The first 1,2&#8208;dicarbonitriles have been prepared for cyclazine systems. In particular, a synthetic procedure to 1,2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3&#8208;arylcycl[3.2.2]azines has been developed. Unexpected chlorination of 3&#8208;arylcycl[3.2.2]azine&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives by thionyl chloride at 4&#8208;position was found, which according to theoretical considerations can proceed by the electrophilic (SEAr) mechanism. The compounds are blue fluorophores in 450&#8208;480 nm region with quantum yields in toluene of ca. 30% for non&#8208;chlorinated derivatives, which decrease to 3&#8208;4% for chlorinated ones.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first 1,2&#8208;dicarbonitriles have been prepared for cyclazine systems. In particular, a synthetic procedure to 1,2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3&#8208;arylcycl[3.2.2]azines has been developed. Unexpected chlorination of 3&#8208;arylcycl[3.2.2]azine&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives by thionyl chloride at 4&#8208;position was found, which according to theoretical considerations can proceed by the electrophilic (SEAr) mechanism. The compounds are blue fluorophores in 450&#8208;480 nm region with quantum yields in toluene of ca. 30% for non&#8208;chlorinated derivatives, which decrease to 3&#8208;4% for chlorinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multivalent and Multifunctional Calixarenes in Bionanotechnology</title>
      <dc:description>
  In the 70's, when Calixarenes started to appear in the literature, no one would have bet even a cent on the future of these strange cyclic oligomers. Fifty years later, a series of appealing features make calixarene a versatile scaffold for the design of ligands with applications ranging from nuclear waste technology to bionanotechnology and nanomedicine.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The key features of calixarene derivatives as multivalent ligands for biomacromolecules and as multifunctional catalysts are reviewed herein. The ease of functionalization and the possibility to control the regio&#8208; and stereochemical disposition of multiple ligating units around a central core allow to obtain ligands with high affinity and selectivity especially for proteins and nucleic acids. The hydrophilic/lipophilic character can also be finely tuned, allowing to obtain monomeric hybrid derivatives or amphiphiles able to self&#8208;assemble alone or in co&#8208;formulation with lipids to give nanoparticles and liposomes that incorporate calixarenes. The knowledge acquired up to now sheds light on the future applications of calixarenes in bionanotechnology and nanomedicine.

      <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycosyl Amino Acid Building Blocks Suitable for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Multivalent Glycopeptide Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>
  Reported is the synthesis of five C&#8208;glycosyl amino acids, which are stable against the acidic conditions used in solid phase peptide synthesis. Key steps include the introduction of a C&#8208;allyl on the carbohydrate, a Grubbs cross&#8208;metathesis, reduction of the obtained alkene, and condensation with a protected lysine.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Five C&#8208;glycosyl functionalized lysine building blocks, featuring C&#8208;glycosidic derivatives of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose, &#945;&#8208;mannose, &#945;&#8208;galactose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine have been designed and synthesized. These derivatives, equipped with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups, are eminently suitable for solid&#8208;phase synthesis of multivalent glycopeptides. The lysine building blocks were prepared from C&#8208;allyl glycosides that underwent a Grubbs cross&#8208;metathesis with an acrylate, followed by a reduction of the C=C double bond in the resulting &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, and liberation of the carboxylate to allow condensation with a lysine side chain. The thus obtained C&#8208;glycosides, five in total, were applied in the solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of three glycopeptides, showing the potential of the described building blocks in the assembly of well&#8208;defined mimics of homo&#8208; and heteromultivalent glycopeptides and glycoclusters.

      <title>Radical Reactions in Alkaloid Synthesis: A Perspective from Carbon Radical Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
  Radical reactions in alkaloid synthesis are reviewed from the perspective of functional groups that act as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors in the construction of new C&#8211;C bonds. The featured functional groups are alkenes, alkynes, halides (alkyl, vinyl and aryl), xanthates, sulfides, selenides, alde&#8208;hydes, ketones, carboxylic acid derivatives (selenoesters and haloacet&#8208;amides), &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, and nitrogen&#8208;compounds able to generate radicals.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The usefulness of radical reactions in alkaloid synthesis is reviewed from the perspective of the functional groups embedded in the molecular structure of synthetic intermediates, that act as precursors of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in the construction of new C&#8211;C bonds. The functional groups featured are alkenes, alkynes, halides (alkyl, vinyl, aryl), xanthates, sulfides, selenides, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acid derivatives (selenoesters, haloacetamides), &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, and &#945;&#8208;heterosubstituted nitrogen&#8208;compounds. The use of nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals for C&#8211;N bond formation is also covered. Among the variety of radical processes applied, the most predominant are the hydride reductive method (Sn, Si), atom transfer radical reactions (Cu, Ru, B), and single&#8208;electron transfer radical reactions promoted by Sm, Ni, Fe, Mn, Ti, and Ag. This review showcases the role radical reactions have played in the recent development of new strategies in alkaloid synthesis, as well as the implementation of new radical procedures in demanding substrates.

      <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Chiral Spirooxindoles with Quaternary Stereogenic Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
  Spirooxindoles with relevant biological activities are achieved with high yield and high stereoselectivity, reaching 99&#8201;% ee by organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis. This minireview highlights recent synthetic works on this topic in the last decade to achieve versatile spirooxindole structures.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The structure of spirooxindoles is present in a large number of natural compounds, with relevant and different biological activities. The organic synthesis of these compounds has been a synthetic challenge due to the fusion of two or more cycles with one or more contiguous stereogenic centers. In this review, it has been described, the feasibility of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis for the achievement of chiral spirooxindoles through two&#8208; or three&#8208;component reaction in the presence of a chiral organocatalyst producing the compounds with high yield, high diastereoselectivity and with high enantiomeric purity. This review covers literature from 2010 to 2019. The most explored reactions for this purpose have been 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, Diels&#8208;Alder and nucleophilic heterocyclic carbenes reactions, where their reaction mechanisms showed in this review are an approach of a possible mechanism.

      <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes</title>
      <dc:description>Endoperoxides are a source of bioactive compounds which drove to some important anti&#8208;malarial drugs such as artemisinin or arterolane. 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes drew the attention of many scientists, through the isolation of numerous natural products containing this peroxidized ring structure such as the plakinic acid family or the biosynthetic study of prostaglandins. Thus, a considerable work was reported for the synthesis of such endoperoxides, but mainly applied to the synthesis of 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208; tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The recent isolation of new natural products containing a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted dioxolane ring brought our attention on how to specifically prepare such structures. Herein, we tentatively summarize exhaustively all the methods reported for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. Therefore, nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide, use of electrophilic oxygen singlet, use of oxygen triplet in radical reaction and the chemistry of peroxycarbenium ions will be presented for this purpose.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Endoperoxides are a source of bioactive compounds which drove to some important anti&#8208;malarial drugs such as artemisinin or arterolane. 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes drew the attention of many scientists, through the isolation of numerous natural products containing this peroxidized ring structure such as the plakinic acid family or the biosynthetic study of prostaglandins. Thus, a considerable work was reported for the synthesis of such endoperoxides, but mainly applied to the synthesis of 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208; tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The recent isolation of new natural products containing a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted dioxolane ring brought our attention on how to specifically prepare such structures. Herein, we tentatively summarize exhaustively all the methods reported for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. Therefore, nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide, use of electrophilic oxygen singlet, use of oxygen triplet in radical reaction and the chemistry of peroxycarbenium ions will be presented for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8211;C &#948;&#8208;Bonds: Difunctionalization of Dienones</title>
      <dc:description>
  A new and efficient catalytic strategy that combines organocatalysis and iodine catalysis was first developed for the difunctionalization of dienone. The reaction employs molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant, and proceeds under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. The approach results in 1,5&#8208;diketo epoxides in moderate to high yields.

      <dc:description>Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation is a fundamental transformation of synthetic organic chemistry. This minireview focuses on our works related to reductive aldol reaction, reductive Mannich reaction, reductive &#945;&#8208;acylation, and reductive &#945;&#8208;carboxylation by using rhodium catalyst to achieve C&#8722;C bond formation.

This condition could apply to other electrophiles such as imines, acid chlorides, and acid anhydrides, and the corresponding &#946;&#8208;lactams, or &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds were obtained in good yields, respectively. A key intermediate, Rh&#8722;H complex would play an important role to accomplish 1,4&#8208;reduction, which could easily be derived from RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn. The synthesis of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, was also achieved by using Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich reaction as an application. We expect that the reaction could be used in a wide range of fields by further development.</dc:description>

      <title>Indenofluorene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Scaffolds for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (IF&#8208;TTFs) comprise a class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated sensitizers that exhibit strong absorptions in the visible region and two reversible one&#8208;electron oxidations. Herein we present the synthesis and optical as well as redox properties of novel IF&#8208;TTF donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds that were integrated in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs) via anchoring of a carboxylic acid end&#8208;group on the scaffolds to TiO  2  . Synthetically, the scaffolds were constructed by Sonogashira coupling reactions between an iodo&#8208;functionalized IF&#8208;TTF and an acceptor moeity containing a terminal alkyne. These very first IF&#8208;TTF based candidates for DSCs exhibited high performances, in particular a dye incorporating a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety, showing a conversion efficiency of 6.4%. This result signals that IF&#8208;TTF derivatives present a promising class of compounds for further structural modifications. Such modifications will benefit from the readiness of the iodo&#8208;funcitonalized IF&#8208;TTF building block to undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (IF&#8208;TTFs) comprise a class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated sensitizers that exhibit strong absorptions in the visible region and two reversible one&#8208;electron oxidations. Herein we present the synthesis and optical as well as redox properties of novel IF&#8208;TTF donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds that were integrated in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs) via anchoring of a carboxylic acid end&#8208;group on the scaffolds to TiO  2  . Synthetically, the scaffolds were constructed by Sonogashira coupling reactions between an iodo&#8208;functionalized IF&#8208;TTF and an acceptor moeity containing a terminal alkyne. These very first IF&#8208;TTF based candidates for DSCs exhibited high performances, in particular a dye incorporating a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety, showing a conversion efficiency of 6.4%. This result signals that IF&#8208;TTF derivatives present a promising class of compounds for further structural modifications. Such modifications will benefit from the readiness of the iodo&#8208;funcitonalized IF&#8208;TTF building block to undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>We report a full account of our efforts towards bioinspired oxidative cyclizations of geissochizine and analogues to mimic the biosynthesis of the  mavacuran  ,  akuammilan  and  excelsinidine  groups of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The construction of the A,B,C,D ring system of geissoschizine was first achieved by merging two known syntheses of this alkaloid. Modified Ma&#8217;s oxidative conditions (KHMDS/I  2  ) applied directly to geissoschizine induced formation of the N4&#8208;C16 bond encountered in the excelsinidines core. Identical conditions applied to C16&#8208;dimethylmalonate&#8208;containing N4&#8208;quaternized substrates ended to the formation of the  mavacurans  core (N1&#8208;C16 bond).

      <title>A new synthetic strategy leading to homochiral macrocycles derived from 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine and (1S,2S)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclopentane.</title>
      <dc:description>The condensation of enantiomerically pure  trans  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclopentane (DACP) with 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine (DFP) in methanol followed by reduction results in a mixture of 2+2, 3+3, 4+4 and 5+5 macrocyclic amines, which allowed the separation of small amounts of new large 4+4 and 5+5 products using GPC. The replacement of DACP with the extended 2+1 primary diamine, containing two DACP and one DFP moieties, results in a new dynamic library in the condensation reaction with DFP. This library afforded the 4+4 macrocycle as the main product together with a considerable amount of a giant 6+6 macrocycle. Conversely, the similar reaction of enantiomerically pure DACP with the extended 1+2 dialdehyde, comprising of one DACP and two DFP units, leads almost exclusively to the 2+2 macrocycle, whereas the condensation of both extended 2+1 diamine and 1+2 dialdehyde precursors delivers selectively the 3+3 macrocycle. The tendency for formation of larger macrocycles in the condensation of the extended 2+1 primary diamine with DFP and lack of such preference in the reaction of DACP with the extended 1+2 dialdehyde was supported by theoretical calculations. The obtained macrocyclic amines were converted to their salts with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The crystal structures of the protonated forms of 2+2, 3+3 and 4+4 macrocyclic amines (and model structure of the 6+6 macrocycle) indicate binding of chloride or sulphate anions in the cavities formed by the folding of the macrocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>Novel application of polymer networks carrying tertiary amines as catalyst inside microflow reactors used for Knoevenagel reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A novel application is described for utilizing hydrogel dots as organocatalyst carriers inside microfluidic reactors. Tertiary amines were covalently immobilized in the hydrogel dots. Due to the diffusion of reactants within the swollen hydrogel dots, the accessible amount of catalysts inside a microfluidic reactor chamber can be increased compared to the accessible amount of surface&#8208;bound catalysts. To perform fast Knoevenagel reactions, important flow parameters had to be validated to optimize the reactor performance while keeping the dimensions of the reactor chamber constant; e. g. the height of the hydrogel dots had to be adjusted to the invariable dimensions of the reactor chamber, or an adjustment of organocatalysts in the hydrogel dots had to be validated to achieve the highest conversion rate during a certain residence time. To characterize the conversion, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopy were utilized as an offline and online method, respectively. With suitable hydrogel dots, the influence of different flow parameters (e.g., operating flow rate and reactant concentration) on the selected model reactions in the microfluidic reactor was investigated. Finally, a variety of reactants were screened with the optimized flow parameters. With these results, the turnover frequency was determined for the Knoevenagel reactions in a microfluidic reactor, and the results were compared with published data that were determined by other synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

The reactivity of these reagents was demonstrated through the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; and &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;regioselective monofluoromethylation of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Employing this reagent, a wide range of &#946;&#8208;keto esters easily underwent &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;regioselective monofluoromethylation reaction to afford their corresponding &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;monofluoromethylated products in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Contrastively, various malonates were smoothly transferred into their corresponding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;monofluoromethylated products in good to excellent yields under the standard reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mild Deprotection of Dithioacetals by TMSCl/NaI Association in CH3CN</title>
      <dc:description>
  TMSCl associated with NaI was used to deprotect various dithioacetals in CH3CN with good to excellent yields. This metal&#8208;free process can also be applied with success for the regeneration of carbonyl of O,O&#8208;acetals, O,S&#8208;oxathianes, S,N&#8208;acetals, ketimines, and hydrazones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A mild process using a combination of TMSCl and NaI in acetonitrile is used to regenerate carbonyl compounds from a variety of dithiane and dithiolane derivatives. This easy to handle and inexpensive protocol is also efficient to deprotect oxygenated and mixed acetals as 1,3&#8208;dioxanes, 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;oxathianes quantitatively. As a possible extension of this method, it was also shown that nitrogenated substrates such as hydrazones, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and ketimines reacted well under these conditions to give the expected ketones in high yields. The methodology proposed herein is a good alternative to the existing methods since it does not use metals, oxidants, reducing agents, acidic or basic media, and keto&#8208;products were obtained in high to excellent yields.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>ortho&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Hydrocarbons Assembled Using Olefin Metathesis</title>
      <dc:description>
  Macrocycles have been assembled from vinyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. The major products are trimers with congested, twisted structures. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations show that heterochiral configurations are favored. Photophysical properties are also discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  While many foldamer systems reliably fold into well&#8208;defined secondary structures, higher order structure remains a challenge. A simple strategy for the organization of folded subunits in space is to link them together within a macrocycle. Previous work has shown that o&#8208;phenylenes can be co&#8208;assembled with rod&#8208;shaped linkers into twisted macrocycles, showing an interesting synergy between folding and thermodynamically controlled macrocyclization. In these systems the foldamer units were largely decoupled from each other both conformationally and electronically. Here, we show that hydrocarbon macrocycles, with very short ethenylene linkers, can be assembled from o&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations shows that the products are approximately triangular trimer macrocycles with helical o&#8208;phenylene corners in a heterochiral configuration. Their photophysics are dominated by the 4,4'&#8208;diphenylstilbene moieties, the longest conjugated segments, with further conjugation broken by the twisting of the o&#8208;phenylenes.

      <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs): Synthesis of New Fluorinated Silanes and Diversity of their Synthetic Character</title>
      <dc:description>
  We present here the hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofloroolefins catalyzed by Pt, Pd, and Rh complexes as an efficient route toward a family of new polyfluorinated silanes as well as their use as versatile building blocks for subsequent functionalization based on C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  New polyfluorinated silanes were synthesized via the Pt, Rh and Pd catalyzed hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) in moderate to excellent yields. HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) and &#8211;1234ze (1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) were reactive with Pt catalyst to form tetrafluoropropylsilanes along with defluorosilylation products. The Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers of HFO&#8208;1336mzz (1,1,1,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobut&#8208;2&#8208;ene) gave the desired silanes with Pd catalysis in good to excellent yields, while with Pt catalyst only the dehydrofluorination product CF2=CHCH2CF3 (HFO&#8208;1345czf, 1,1,4,4,4&#8208;pentafluorobut&#8208;1&#8208;ene) was obtained. Synthetic applications of the new polyfluorinated silanes were illustrated by conversion of dichloro(hexafluorobutyl)(methyl)silane to the cyclic trisiloxane, which can serve as a monomer for the preparation of polysiloxanes. In addition, the hexafluorobutylsilanes showed defluorinative reactivity with lithium reagents, thereby demonstrating their synthetic utility as valuable building blocks for further transformations via C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.

      <title>Mechanism and Regioselectivity of Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Ene&#8211;Ketenes: A DFT Study</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8211;ketenes gives either fused&#8208;ring (via normal [2+2] cycloaddition) or bridged&#8208;ring (via cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition) cyclobutanones. For example, terminal ene&#8211;ketenes give the fused&#8208;ring cycloadducts, whereas dimethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes furnish bridged&#8208;ring cycloadducts. For monomethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes, both [2+2] cycloadducts are generated. However, there are no systematic theoretical studies on such a regiochemistry in the literature. Here we report our DFT study on the mechanism and regioselectivity of these intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions. DFT calculations reveal that both normal and cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloadditions are concerted processes. The normal [2+2] cycloaddition transition state is forming an internal carbocation while the cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition transition state is generating an external carbocation (see  Scheme 1  of the paper). On the basis of the relative stability of these carbocations, which is affected by both the tether and the substituent(s) on the alkene, a regiochemistry prediction model is proposed to understand and predict the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Distally&#8208;Bridged Chiral Resorcinarene Crowns</title>
      <dc:description>Our interest in the potential of chiral tetramethoxy&#8208;resorcinarene as agents for chiral recognition has led us to synthesise twelve distally&#8208;bridged chiral resorcinarene crowns. The fascinating architecture of these partially&#8208;enclosed chiral basket molecules is evident in the solid&#8208;state structures which have been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Moreover, the enantiomers of these chiral resorcinarene crowns have been resolved via diastereomeric resolution, with the absolute configuration of the diastereomers being determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. This work enables further exploration of these enantio&#8208;pure chiral baskets as possible chiral resolving agents.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our interest in the potential of chiral tetramethoxy&#8208;resorcinarene as agents for chiral recognition has led us to synthesise twelve distally&#8208;bridged chiral resorcinarene crowns. The fascinating architecture of these partially&#8208;enclosed chiral basket molecules is evident in the solid&#8208;state structures which have been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Moreover, the enantiomers of these chiral resorcinarene crowns have been resolved via diastereomeric resolution, with the absolute configuration of the diastereomers being determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. This work enables further exploration of these enantio&#8208;pure chiral baskets as possible chiral resolving agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Review on Oxidative Gold&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Arenes &#8211; Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies have become essential in modern organic synthesis. While palladium has historically dominated this field, other transition metals have arisen as potent and orthogonal alternatives. Gold, typically thought of as just a Lewis acid, has recently demonstrated redox chemistry in several cross&#8208;coupling reactions using an external oxidant.

      <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Spirocyclic Pyrrolidine&#8208;Lactones by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>
  Enantiomerically pure spirocyclic pyrrolidines are prepared by highly diastereoselective dipolar cycloaddition using chiral aminolactones. Silver shows dual catalysis activating the dipole and the dipolarophile simultaneously. Final products incorporated a high functional group density, a new quaternary sterogenic center, and a spiranic unit connecting a pyrrolidine and a lactone.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The preparation of two enantiomerically enriched amino lactones as chiral starting substrates for asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions is described. They act as precursors of the chiral imino lactones, which form in situ the corresponding azomethine ylides. They react with electrophilic alkenes under silver catalysis to afford spirolactone&#8208;pyrrolidines products. The sequential method consisting in one&#8208;pot imine formation &#8594; cycloaddition is optimized and compared with the multicomponent process. The scope of the reaction is studied as well as the stereochemical outcomes and the mechanistic details using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

      <title>Applications of Chiral Cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) Metal Complexes in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes containing cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands are versatile and robust catalysts widely applied in organic synthesis. During the last two decades chiral Cpx complexes have been applied in a variety of enantioselective transformations. Often associated with Group 9 metals (Co, Rh, Ir), chiral Cpx ligands have also been used in combination with early transition&#8208;metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this mini&#8208;review asymmetric reactions that have been successfully steered with chiral Cpx ligand metal complexes are discussed according to the metal coordinated. Several ligand designs have successfully been used in a diverse array of reactions, in particular C&#8208;H functionalisations, with binaphthyl&#8208;derived ligands leading the field. Challenges with these ligands derive from the need for their multi&#8208;step synthesis, and recently new ligands have been designed which can be accessed in shorter sequences from readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate based Ionic Liquids (CHILs): Synthesis and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate based ionic liquids (CHILs) are a sub&#8208;class of ionic liquids which first emerged in 2007 and has since then attracted a steadily growing community of organic chemists. Since carbohydrates are naturally occurring materials with a broad spectrum of diastereomers, they are fitting materials for ionic liquids bearing stereochemical information. This review gives an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of all CHILs and their applications in asymmetric chemistry.</dc:description>
