         <title>Reactions of Halogermylenes with NHCs: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of the Rind&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (1a) and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (1b), with two types of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2 and Im&#8208;Me4) resulted in the formation of the halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts, (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(Eind)GeBr (2a') and (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(EMind)GeCl (2b'), and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(Eind)Ge]+[Br&#8211;] (3a) and [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(EMind)Ge]+[Cl&#8211;] (3b). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligands, whose structures were confirmed by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Based on DFT and QTAIM calculations of 2a' and the cationic part of 3a, it was concluded that while the Ge&#8211;C(Eind) and Ge&#8211;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&#8211;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands. The formation mechanism of 3a from 1a and two NHC molecules via (Im&#8208;Me4)(Eind)GeBr (2a) is discussed based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Latent Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Two N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Ligands, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity with Distinctive Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel bis(NHC) ruthenium complexes of the form (NHC1)(NHC2)Ru(=CRR')Cl2 (where NHC represents N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and CRR' denotes Ph&#8208;indenylidene or benzylidene moieties) were prepared from second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation Grubbs catalysts. These complexes exhibited thermal latency in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), and several ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. &#160;The species best activated by heat included either IPr or SIPr as an NHC ligand, highlighting how bulky isopropyl substituents enhance NHC lability. Most interestingly, UV&#8208;C (255 nm) irradiation readily activated two complexes that contained benzylidene ligands for the ROMP of cyclooctadiene, providing a unique opportunity for the efficient UV&#8208;C activation of olefin metathesis catalysts. Beyond their special utility in UV&#8208;C&#8208;initiated ROMP, because of their high robustness, these complexes showed promising activity for challenging high&#8208;temperature CM and RCM reactions of alkenyl&#8208;nitrile substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Fluorescence Properties of Oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines: Exploring Structure&#8208;Property Relationships and Design Strategies for Tailored Photophysical Characteristics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation. The systematic investigation of the photophysical properties of the synthesized compounds revealed that the position and nature of the substituents on the oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline core significantly influenced the absorption and emission characteristics. The 6,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution pattern was found to provide an optimal balance between high fluorescence quantum yield and moderate Stokes shift, whereas the 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution offered a unique combination of large Stokes shift and long wavelength emission. Additionally, the presence of a trifluoromethyl group at the C9 position was identified as a crucial structural feature for maintaining strong fluorescence. These structure&#8208;property relationships provide valuable insights for the rational design of novel fluorescent oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives with tailored photophysical properties, which could find potential applications in the development of fluorescent probes and organic light&#8208;emitting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Radical Strategy for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component radical reaction involving alcohols or alkanes and in situ&#8208;formed imines. The imines, generated from aldehydes and amines, serve as key reactants, while the inexpensive and readily available sodium decatungstate (NaDT) is employed as a photocatalyst. This strategy enables the functionalization of industrially accessible alcohols or alkanes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction is operationally simple, exhibits high conversion efficiency, facilitates straightforward post&#8208;reaction processing, and demonstrates excellent atom and step economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters: Impact of Reaction Parameters &amp; Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate exhibited either high values for regioselectivity (96&#8201;%) or selectivity (78&#8201;%) for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde&#8197;2&#8201;a depending on pressure, CO/H2 composition and temperature in a design of experiments approach. Expanding the substrate scope gave insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealing a significant electronic influence of the substituent on regioselectivity and selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.







Abstract
The hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters represents a highly atom&#8208;economical route towards &#946;&#8208;aldehydes with potential application as precursors for derivatization to pharmaceuticals such as (R)&#8208;Baclofen or Pregabalin. Methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate as an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester has been rarely studied in hydroformylation, particularly with regard to a parameter screening for reaction optimization. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate to the desired &#946;&#8208;aldehyde utilizing a phosphine&#8208;free Rh catalyst was investigated with a focus on identification of parameters with a significant effect on regioselectivity and selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde amongst all products. Initially, reaction time, solvent, and catalyst loading were screened, followed by a reaction optimization using design of experiments (DoE). The reaction output was analyzed in relation to pressure, temperature and CO/H2 composition revealing that while either regioselectivity or overall selectivity (termed selectivity) can attain high values, none of the conditions leads to optimal levels of both regioselectivity and selectivity. As predicted by the model, the experimental results under two different conditions demonstrated excellent regioselectivity (96&#8201;%) with medium selectivity (57&#8201;%) and high selectivity (78&#8201;%) with good regioselectivity (93&#8201;%). Expansion of the substrate scope to substituted methyl cinnamate derivatives showed significant influence of the substituents and, thus, their electronic effects on regioselectivity and selectivity.

         <title>An Approach to Functionalization of Cucurbit[n]uril Through a Tetrahydrothiopheno Equatorial Substituent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of a tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril provides an avenue to reactive derivatization. This process extends the potential for future applications of the cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. Also highlighted are new glycoluril derivatives that may serve as precursors in the synthesis of cucurbit[n]uril or their analogues.







Abstract
A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.

Among various carbene precursors, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;N&#8208;tosylhydrazones have emerged as promising candidates in such reactions. In this study, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbene coupling reaction involving &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, arylboronates and alcohols. This approach provides a complementary method for the efficient synthesis of alkyl enol ethers, showcasing a broad substrate scope and favorable yields.

         <title>High Throughput Experimentation as a Tool to Guide the Microwave Assisted Catalytic Amidation of Aryl Amines with Aryl Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized DoE, HTE and microwave synthesis to develop a catalytic amidation protocol that follows the principles of green chemistry through use of catalysis to improve atom economy, biorenewable solvent, high substrate loadings and energy efficient microwave heating.







Abstract
The formation of amides is one of the most essential transformations in the pharmaceutical industry, but most synthetic procedures include the use of stoichiometric poor atom economy reagents. These limitations are often compounded when condensing aryl amines with aryl acids due to their inherently low reactivity. To overcome such hurdles, we utilized high throughput experimentation to screen 640 different reaction conditions to find a suitable catalyst and solvent for benzamide formation. Based on those initial findings, we developed an efficient catalytic transformation of aryl amines with aryl acids into N&#8208;arylbenzamides using a 15&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading of 2,4&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl boronic acid and trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide in 2&#8208;MeTHF under microwave conditions for 1&#8197;h in the presence of 3&#8197;&#197; molecular sieves. Our method shows that even sterically hindered amines and carboxylic acids can be converted to the corresponding N&#8208;arylbenzamides, including previously reported unreactive aromatic and secondary amines, in good to excellent yields. This approach follows the principles of green chemistry through use of[1] catalysis to improve atom economy,[2] a biorenewable solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF),[3] high substrate loadings (0.5&#8197;M), and[4] energy efficient microwave heating.

         <title>User&#8208;friendly and Green Procedure for a Photoinduced Wohl&#8208;Ziegler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and ecofriendly catalyst&#8208;free allylic and benzylic bromination method using a stoichiometric amount of NBS under LEDs light irradiation is described. This method provides an alternative to the Wohl&#8208;Ziegler procedure which is classically performed in the presence of a radical initiator in the banned solvent CCl4. The method is applicable to a wide range of substrates, is easily scalable and is carried out at room temperature under air atmosphere. No special equipment other than the LEDs lamp is needed.







Abstract
A convenient Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination protocol using NBS under visible light in standard laboratory glassware is described. The monobromination reaction is efficient and selective over a wide range of substrates. Unlike previous studies, we prove that the use of a photocatalyst is unnecessary. The proposed protocol is simple to implement and applicable at the gram scale. The reaction takes place in a few tens of minutes at room temperature and offers an alternative to the use of CCl4, which is conventionally used for Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination. Alternative conditions of bromination by CBr4 in the presence of a photocatalyst have also been investigated.

         <title>O&#8208;C Glycoside Rearrangement through Time&#8208;Controlled Electrochemical Flow Strategy: Switching between Kinetics and Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report time&#8208;controlled O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement in flow&#8208;electrochemical microreactors, focusing on kinetic and thermodynamic selectivity. The selective synthesis of phenolic O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides has been explored using O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement. We investigated the time&#8208;control of O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement using a flow microreactor, which allows for second&#8208;scale reaction control. The electrochemical approach demonstrated that shortening the residence time leads to the selective synthesis of O&#8208;glycosides, while longer times favor the formation of C&#8208;glycosides. Kinetic studies revealed that substituents on the phenol ring affect the rate of O&#8208;glycoside formation and its rearrangement to C&#8208;glycosides. Finally, continuous flow synthesis was demonstrated, showcasing the scalability and utility of this method for producing bioactive substances.

         <title>Diving into the Shielding Surfaces: Construction of Atropisomeric Axes via Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed and synthesized a diverse library of atropisomeric molecular systems using a scaffold hopping strategy based on the GBB&#8208;3CR. Structural and computational analyses revealed key CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, aromatic shielding effects, and conformational dynamics, providing insights into their potential biological relevance.







Abstract
The CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, characterized by a CH group acting as a hydrogen bond donor and &#960; electrons serving as the acceptor, shares structural similarities with hydrogen bond and plays a significant role in a multitude of molecular systems. However, due to the weak and variable nature of these interactions, they remain poorly understood. Recently, we reported the design of high rotational barrier atropisomeric systems incorporating CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Building on these insights, we explored the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) to access additional atropisomeric systems. We hypothesized that the GBB&#8208;derived scaffold could serve as a modular platform, facilitating the strategic incorporation of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions to enhance structural diversity and functionality. Using 2&#8208;aminopyridine, polyaromatic aldehydes and ortho&#8208;substituted phenyl isocyanides, we systematically explored the substrate scope. We investigated the impact of different shelves and arms, emphasizing the effect of aromatic ring topology and number on molecular conformations and ring currents. To analyze experimental NMR signals of methyl groups, we calculated the chemical shifts and estimated the ring current contributions. The through&#8208;space NMR shielding calculations and isochemical shielding surface (ICSS) visualizations provided insights into the electronic environments within the scaffold, advancing our understanding of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and their potential applications.

         <dc:description>
A samarium diiodide/samarium&#8208;mediated direct deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes with hydroborate ester has been reported. In this method, unactivated aldehydes and hydroborate ester have been employed as starting materials for the synthesis of primary alkyl borate esters. Broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance have demonstrated that this is a robust method for deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Automated and Parallel Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a streamlined, automated method for synthesizing amide&#8208;containing compounds, crucial in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Utilizing pre&#8208;packed capsules and 96&#8208;well plate kits, this user&#8208;friendly approach simplifies the reaction and isolation processes, accommodating diverse reactants. This work allows to enhance medicinal chemistry by accelerating the creation of compound libraries with high efficiency and yield.







Abstract
Amide bonds are ubiquitous in molecules of interest such as pharmaceuticals, natural products, and agrochemicals. Over the last decades, significant efforts have been directed at developing efficient methods for the formation of this class of chemical bonds. Herein, we disclose a robust, user&#8208;friendly approach for the efficient and rapid parallel synthesis of amide&#8208;containing compounds, in good yield and purity. Our approach utilizes automated synthesis technologies and pre&#8208;packed capsules containing all the necessary materials for the reaction and work&#8208;up. Following manual addition of the amine and carboxylic acid, the reaction and product isolation is achieved automatically in a standardized, integrated manner. This methodology tolerates a wide diversity of carboxylic acids and amines (or amine salts). To accelerate discovery and rapidly create amide&#8208;containing compound libraries, the method was miniaturized into an automated parallel synthesis format, using 96&#8208;well plate kits, which could be beneficial to medicinal chemists.

A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step procedure utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water was disclosed. Conceptually, this novel approach involves an initial Pd(0)/TPPMS&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of the benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines.







Abstract
We report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction/aromatization cascade utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water. Conceptually, this novel one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step approach involves an initial Pd(0)/sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene&#8208;3&#8208;sulfonate (TPPMS)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines. The &#960;&#8208;benzylPd&#8197;(II) catalytic system generated in&#8197;situ from Pd(0)/TPPMS and benzylic alcohols was found to be highly effective for alcohol dehydrogenation in water.

The enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the asymmetric construction of acyclic 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon has been established, which involves an enantioselective addition reaction and a subsequent chelate&#8208;controlled diastereoselective alkylation reaction. Specifically, the enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.

         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of using 2&#8208;phenacyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indanediones has been demonstrated by reacting with an un&#8208;symmetrical alkyne compound, such as alkyl 3&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)propiolates to access various spiro[4.4]nonanes in a highly regioselective manner. Spiro[4.4]nonanes were further converted to extended pentafulvene &#960;&#8208;systems in an acidic medium. Photophysical properties of the synthesized sulfone&#8208;based pentafulvene dyes are also described.







Abstract
A highly regioselective synthesis of sulfone&#8208;containing spiro[4.4]nonanes has been achieved by the reaction of 2&#8208;phenacyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones with 3&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)propiolates at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were transformed into pentafulvene dyes via unprecedented C&#8722;C bond rearrangement and their photophysical properties are also outlined in this article.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalysed Transamidation of Boc&#8208;Protected Diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) for Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid catalyst drastically accelerated the transamidation of Boc&#8208;DKPs with amino acid esters. This reaction progressed rapidly, and various tripeptides bearing D&#8208;proline residues were synthesised within 30&#8197;min in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. Notably, this method also allowed the preparation of longer tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.







Abstract
A carboxylic acid&#8208;catalysed transamidation of Boc&#8208;protected diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) was developed in this study, which allowed access to various tripeptides featuring a D&#8208;proline residue in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields within 30&#8197;min. Subsequent coupling reactions between the Boc&#8208;DKPs and di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide esters were successfully performed, furnishing the corresponding tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.

Robust route towards the implementation of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation employed cellulose&#8208;derived levoglucosenone ring contraction through a 2&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process. The development and optimization of a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot route towards substituted butyrolactones from levoglucosenone and cyrene derived from cellulose, representing a major step towards the sustainable production of chiral platform chemicals. A range of substituted analogues have been employed and their novelty is outlined in the paper.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot rapid microwave assisted method has been developed for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of biomass derived levoglucosenone (LGO) analogues. This method uses the acidic resin Amberlyst 15 as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in ethanol solution. A small library of C4&#8208;substituted LGO analogues have been synthesised and oxidised using this method giving high yields in short times in each case. The purity of the recovered products was very high removing the need for chromatographic separation.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization for Efficient Synthesis of Quinazolinones from Indoles and Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid/DMSO, and aliphatic amines to obtain valuable quinazolinone derivatives has been described. This strategy demonstrates mild reaction conditions, high efficiency, and excellent tolerance of functional groups. The applicability of the synthetic reaction was validated by synthesis of rutaecarpine and large&#8208;scale efficient synthesis of quinazolinones.







Abstract
In this study, we report an iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid or DMSO, and aliphatic amines to synthesize quinazolinone derivatives via oxygenation cleavage of the C=C double bonds of indoles. This method features mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent functional group tolerance. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated through its application in synthesizing rutaecarpine and a scalable protocol for efficient quinazolinone production.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Formation of a Decasubstituted Phenanthrene by Coupling and Fragmentation of a Smaller Precursor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When epoxynaphthalene 5 is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is the decasubstituted phenanthrene 6, formed by Ullmann coupling and a surprising fragmentation and rearrangement.







Abstract
When 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (5) is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is 1,8&#8208;dibenzoyl&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10&#8208;octaphenylphenanthrene (6) in yields as high as 68&#8201;%. The reaction appears to involve Ullmann coupling of 5 and expulsion of two molecules of diphenylacetylene to give a decaphenyl bis(isobenzofuran) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization and fragmentation to yield phenanthrene 6.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Tandem Synthesis of 6&#8208;H&#8208;Phenanthridine and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and rapid construction of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridines by base&#8208;promoted tandem reactions has been developed. This reaction avoids the usage of transition metal, 2&#8242;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide were simply added and reacted to acquire different structures of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridines in excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we proposed a simple approach for synthesizing 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridine through, which was a tandem reaction and promoted by base. 2&#8242;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and LiN(SiMe3)2 were simply added and combined to obtain different structures of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridines (26 examples, &#8804;90&#8201;% yield). In the syntheses of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenaridine, the transition metal&#8208;free approach outlined in this paper is direct, convenient and easy to execute.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Selective ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Aromatic Amidines with D&#8322;O</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O is demonstrated, achieving high regioselectivity and excellent yields. The use of Mn(CO)5Br as the catalyst and NaOAc as an additive facilitates efficient deuterium incorporation across a diverse range of substrates. The reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and the resulting products can be further transformed into deuterated heterocyclic compounds such as triazoles and imidazoles.







Abstract
We report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O as the deuterium source. The reaction, catalyzed by Mn(CO)5Br in the presence of NaOAc as an additive, proceeds with high regioselectivity, achieving efficient deuterium incorporation at the ortho&#8208;position with excellent yields. The reaction scope was extended to a wide range of substituted aromatic amidines, demonstrating consistently high levels of deuterium incorporation and broad substrate compatibility. Furthermore, the method was successfully scaled up to gram&#8208;scale, and the resulting deuterated products were subsequently transformed into heterocycles, including triazoles and imidazoles.

         <title>Theoretical Investigation on the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;Silylboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically examined. The overall reaction profile was proposed, and the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization was found to take place through an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity was determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect.







Abstract
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.

The Front Cover illustrates a transformation pathway leading to the deuteration of amidines, catalyzed by Mn(CO)5Br, with acetyl groups acting as the concerted metallation&#8211;deprotonation base. Two production line designs, reflecting varying efficiencies, emphasize that the reaction predominantly proceeds through a manganese&#8208;catalyzed five&#8208;membered cyclic transition state and highlight the efficacy and regioselectivity of the catalytic process. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;F. Bai, J. Chen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202401374).

         <title>Strategies for Modification of Tryptophan Residues: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives in Photo&#8208;/ Electrochemical&#8208;Induction, and Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in photo&#8208;induced, electro&#8208;induced and metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications of tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides, among others. The advantages of photoinduction and metal catalysis and their benefits in the development of tryptophan and its tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and their applicability in the development of novel biocompatible methods are discussed. In addition, the current limitations of these methods and the future challenges that need to be addressed are explored.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid distinguished by its unique indole ring, making it an ideal target for chemical modification. Recent advancements in modification strategies, including photo&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;induced, and metal&#8208;catalyzed techniques, have significantly enhanced the efficiency and selectivity of Trp modifications, expanding its applications across drug development, materials science, and environmental monitoring. Photochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which utilize light energy to drive reactions under mild conditions, offer a green and efficient method for Trp transformation. This approach often improves Trp's optical properties, such as fluorescence, thereby enhancing its utility in bioimaging and sensor applications. Light&#8208;driven modifications also allow the introduction of functional groups, yielding bioactive derivatives with potential therapeutic benefits. Electrochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which leverage electric energy to precisely regulate oxidation and reduction processes, enable selective Trp modifications through fine&#8208;tuning of applied potential. This method supports the targeted addition of functional groups like hydroxyl or amino groups, essential for synthesizing Trp derivatives aimed at modulating protein activity and developing new therapeutic agents. Both photo&#8208; and electrochemical methods generate radical intermediates via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET), aligning well with Trp's redox&#8208;active nature. These methods also offer mild and controllable conditions that address chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity challenges inherent in traditional bioconjugation strategies. The promising advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis underscore the appeal of novel Trp&#8208;based bioconjugation methods. In addition, metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations using transition metals such as palladium or copper allow for complex modifications, including C&#8722;H activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which enable site&#8208;selective alterations within the Trp molecule. These metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications yield derivatives with enhanced chemical, optical, or biological properties, suitable for applications in optoelectronics, biosensors, and medicinal chemistry. Collectively, these advancements in Trp modification elevate its utility across diverse scientific disciplines, providing a versatile platform for creating novel compounds with superior chemical, biological, and optical characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the latest advancements in Trp modification, with an emphasis on their transformative impact across various fields.

         <title>Glycosyl Esters as Stable Donors in Chemical Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 10, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl ester donors represent an important class of donors in recent times to construct complex natural products and oligosaccharides. This review summarizes the past and recent methods involving anomeric esters in glycosylation reactions, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters.







Abstract
Efficient glycosylation methods are continuously being developed to obtain homogeneously pure carbohydrates to study their biological roles. The development of effective and stereoselective glycosylations using novel anomeric leaving groups constitutes an active area of research in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Although various glycosyl donors have been developed over the decades, anomeric esters as donors in glycosylation have received significant attention in recent times due to their convenience of preparation, shelf stability, catalytic activation, mild conditions, and high glycosylation efficiency. We focus in this review on several synthetic strategies for the assembly of the glycosyl ester&#8208;containing donors utilized in chemical glycosylation methods, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters in glycoside synthesis are summarized.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Enone&#8208;Tethered Ketones and Aldehydes with Indoles: Substrate&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Indenes and Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade strategy involving the reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles for the synthesis of indenes is outlined in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. Halogen bonding between molecular iodine and enones activates substrates to undergo Michael addition with indoles, resulting in the formation of enolates. These enolates in situ are transformed into indenes via an intramolecular aldol condensation. Enone&#8208;tethered aldehydes, however, react with two molecules of indoles to give indanes through a reaction sequence that involves chemoselective Michael addition followed by intramolecular aldol, and nucleophilic substitution. The substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis has been realized to readily access indenes and indanes bearing indole moieties under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The compatibility of these reactions has also been tested with a scale&#8208;up reaction for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Geminal Difluoroalkenes with Aliphatic Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here an effective, mild and practical approach to stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides by cost&#8208;effective chromium catalysis. This reaction was promoted by inexpensive CrCl2&#160;combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri&#8208;substituted&#160;Z&#8208;fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility to a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to&#160;Z&#8208;alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of beta&#8208;fluoride atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Indazole Synthesis from &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters via Aryne Trapping: A Streamlined Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indazoles are high value chemical building blocks used in medicinal chemistry and materials science for their distinct structural and functional features. This study details a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between various aryl&#8208;ketodiazoesters and ortho&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates under mild conditions, leading predominantly to 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles. N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates were also observed as other products. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable synthetic approach. Mechanistic insights, derived from control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the products. Collectively, these findings underscore the method&#8217;s potential for synthesizing complex indazole derivatives, which hold significant promises for applications in pharmaceutical development and advanced materials research.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc (II) Imidoyl Azide Coordination Polymer, an Unexpected Compound with Insensitive Explosive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of coordination polymer has been discovered while looking for high&#8208;performance, insensitive secondary explosives. This polymer made of scarce imidoyl azide structures, demonstrates interesting pyrotechnic characteristics like a density greater than 2.00&#8197;g.cm&#8722;3 and great insensitivity towards thermal and mechanical stresses. The observation of such an intermediate shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and provides insight into the discovery of new energetic coordination polymers.







Abstract
A wide interest has recently been shown for the use of the tetrazole ring structures in the preparation of insensitive high&#8208;energy materials. Tetrazoles provide a perfect balance between insensitivity and explosive performances and several synthetic routes are available to generate such compounds in high yields. When studying the two&#8208;step synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA), suggested by Shreeve et&#8197;al., an unexpected intermediate structure was observed.

     alt="Zinc (II) Imidoyl Azide Coordination Polymer, an Unexpected Compound with Insensitive Explosive Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of coordination polymer has been discovered while looking for high-performance, insensitive secondary explosives. This polymer made of scarce imidoyl azide structures, demonstrates interesting pyrotechnic characteristics like a density greater than 2.00&#8197;g.cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and great insensitivity towards thermal and mechanical stresses. The observation of such an intermediate shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko-Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and provides insight into the discovery of new energetic coordination polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wide interest has recently been shown for the use of the tetrazole ring structures in the preparation of insensitive high-energy materials. Tetrazoles provide a perfect balance between insensitivity and explosive performances and several synthetic routes are available to generate such compounds in high yields. When studying the two-step synthesis of N,N&#8217;-bis((1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA), suggested by Shreeve &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;., an unexpected intermediate structure was observed. This stable intermediate in aqueous conditions, reacted with hydrochloric acid to generate the desired tetrazole heterocycle suggesting the existence of a scarce organozinc imidoyl azide compound, also coined &lt;i&gt;&#8220;open tetrazole&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;. This unusually stable structure is exceptionally isolated as a solid. Furthermore, the possibility of zinc ions coordinating several organic imidoyl azide molecules at the same time, creates a sparse and unprecedented coordination polymer. This new polymeric intermediate is revealed in the synthesis of BTMNA when the starting material, the iminodiacetonitrile (IDA), reacts with sodium azide in water with the assistance of zinc chloride. The intermediate was characterized by Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Driven Organophosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Iododifluoroalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalysed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed without the need for additional base. This reaction demonstrates compatibility with a variety of iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides to provide a concise and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides, which could be readily transformed into the corresponding multisubstituted alkenes of great importance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalyzed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed, eliminating the need for additional metal catalysts and bases. This protocol enables the efficient and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides under mild conditions, demonstrating excellent tolerance to iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytic phosphine functions not only as a Lewis base, forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex with difluoroalkyl iodides through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions to generate Rf radicals, but also as a halogen transfer shuttle catalyst to facilitate the catalytic cycle.

The biomass pyrolysis product levoglucosenone enables the preparation of the feeding modulator 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;arabino&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and the diastereomer 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone. The key steps involve a diastereoselective bromination using an enamine bromination&#8208;hydrolysis strategy on the bicyclic ring&#8208;system followed by selective nucleophilic displacements with benzoate giving access to both diastereomers. The outcomes of the displacement are rationalized by the involvement of oxirane intermediates.







Abstract
The feeding modulator 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;arabino&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and the diastereomer 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone have been prepared from the biomass pyrolysis product Cyrene (dihydrolevoglucoseone). The arabino&#8208;configured lactone was accessed via the diastereoselective bromination of Cyrene, through an enamine&#8208;bromination/hydrolysis strategy, giving the thermodynamically stable equatorial bromide after a base catalyzed equilibration. A Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation and then reaction with benzoate followed by hydrolysis gave the target lactone. 3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone was accessible via the reaction of the bromide with benzoate prior to Baeyer&#8208;Villiger reaction resulting in the retention of configuration. The diastereoselectivity for the reactions and the formation of byproducts was rationalized by the involvement of an intermediate oxirane and subsequent House&#8208;Meinwald rearrangements.

         <dc:description>Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via&#160;regioselective C&#8211;H bond activation is both highly efficient and atom&#8208;economical but often hindered by the use of toxic solvents and limited catalyst recyclability. Herein, we present a recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H annulation of N&#8208;pyrimidinyl aryl amines with cyclic 1,3&#8208;diones in water, affording tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives. The basic aqueous environment amplifies the solubility differences between the substrates and the desired product, thereby promoting efficient C&#8211;H activation and subsequent cyclization. This method showcases broad substrate compatibility, eliminates the need for pre&#8208;synthesized iodonium ylides, and features an easy work&#8208;up procedure alongside straightforward catalyst recovery. The Rh(III) catalyst retains its activity for at least five cycles, providing a sustainable and practical strategy for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;Regioselective Formal (1+5) Cycloaddition of Isoindolinone&#8208;Derived Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective formal (1+5) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols with 2&#8208;indolylphenols was established, which afforded a series of indole&#8208;fused chromanes with potential antitumor activity in overall good yields (up to 99%). A tandem cycloaddition process was proposed based on detailed control experiments. Moreover, biological evaluation demonstrates the promising application of indole&#8208;fused chromanes. This work not only established the first &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective (1+n) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols, but also provided a good example of 1,5&#8208;CO&#8208;regioselective (5+1) cycloadditions involving 2&#8208;indolylphenols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;fused chromanes with potential biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;Phosphinates and Insights into Their Conformational Preferences Within a Chimeric Duplex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the synthesis of xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks containing both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases is reported. A DNA&#8208;phoXyloNA&#8208;DNA chimeric sequence containing a central 2'&#8208;5'&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleoside uracil residue was chemically synthesized, and its structural properties were examined using advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational simulations. Results outlined herein suggest that the xylose sugar moiety predominantly favors an N&#8208;type conformation stabilized by intraresidue hydrogen bonding interactions, while the inclusion of an extra methylene group in the backbone introduces significant flexibility within the internucleotide linkage. Within a duplex structure, disrupted hydrogen bonding interactions in the xU5::dA16 base pair, combined with diminished stacking interactions at the site of modification collectively contribute to a reduction in thermal stability compared to the unmodified counterpart. These findings enhance our understanding of the stability and dynamics of orthogonal backbone&#8208;sugar modified nucleic acids (XNAs), aiding in the design of functionally tailored analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid 2 through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid 2 exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, 2 undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound 7. The solid&#8208;state structure of 7, determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals a diamond&#8208;shaped Sn2P2 moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8211;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes Enabled by Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a simple and convenient protocol for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using readily available iron salt Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, and phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing material. All reactions proceed efficiently at mild conditions with air as terminal oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, and is distinguished by its simplicity, mild temperatures and broad scope. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80% isolated yield and with 100% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

Abstract
Up to now, there were only few reports on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed reductions of thioamides, one of the explanation of this scarcity being the possible metallic catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of species containing sulfur. In this contribution, we report the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of tertiary thioamides under hydrosilylation conditions at ambient temperature, the reaction being driven by blue light irradiation. To perform selectively the reduction of thioamides leading to amines (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields), highlighting the sole cleavage of the C=S bond, Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Cycloadditions to Prepare Isooxazoline&#8208;Fused Furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component [4+2]/[3+2] sequential cycloadditions of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM), nitrile N&#8208;oxides and furans is developed for the synthesis of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters in good yields and high diastereoselectivity. The method features high reaction orders in the three&#8208;component reaction.







Abstract
A variety of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters were prepared in 40&#8201;%&#8208;87&#8201;% yields with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The control experimental results revealed that the reaction underwent in the order of [4+2] cycloaddition and sequential [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM) generated from 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines, furans, and nitrile N&#8208;oxides generated from hydroxamoyl chlorides. The present method features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high diastereoselectivity of four stereocenters, and novel scaffolds of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines.

         <title>Successors of SmI2: Next Generation Metal, Photo and Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Reductive Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SmI2 is a celebrated reductant to perform numerous challenging reductions and reductive coupling reactions. Nevertheless, stoichiometric nature of SmI2 reactions motivated to develop alternative and more sustainable synthetic methods. Many of these methods are developed on the principle of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET).







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a pivotal role in generating radical intermediates which are pillars of constructing complex molecular structure. Since the introduction by Kagan, SmI2 played a key role in the single electron transfer mediated reductive transformations. Despite significant applications of SmI2 in high profile synthesis of natural products, usage of SmI2 was discoursed due to high molecular weight of reagent, less solubility and most importantly stoichiometric nature of the reactions. Recent years have witnessed a renaissance in photo&#8208;and electro&#8208;catalytic reactions which are more sustainable in nature. A handful of these reactions showed the potential to replace SmI2 as more sustainable and greener alternative. This prospective article aims to demonstrate potential reducing systems to replace the use of SmI2.

         <title>Monomers with Spirocyclic Acetal units for Synthesis of Sustainable and Recyclable Polymers with Improved Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;functional molecules with spirocyclic acetal structures have recently emerged as attractive monomers to prepare high&#8208;performance polymers, which may subsequently be de&#8208;polymerized and recycled under specific physicochemical conditions. Spirocyclic acetal structures can be formed by condensation of a suitable aldehyde or ketone with a polyol so that the functionalities necessary for the polymerization are retained. In general, rigid spirocyclic acetal units efficiently enhance the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg). This typically increases, e.g., the stiffness and use temperature of the materials. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of spirocyclic acetal units to acidic conditions may be utilized to develop polymers that may be conveniently and selectively cleaved into, e.g., monomers or oligomers under controlled acidic conditions. This opens up opportunities for making new chemically recyclable polymers and plastics. Herein, we highlight the recent progress in molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures and their use for the design and preparation of chemically recyclable high&#8208;Tg polymers. Monomers and polymers with the potential to be derived from sustainable biobased resources are given special attention.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Evaluation of Knoevenagel&#8208;Derived &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation is one of an important reaction that facilitates the formation of olefin linkages (&#8722;C=C&#8722;), and thus has been widely employed to synthesize new &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. This review summarizes the synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds constructed using diketonate/azopyrrole&#8208;BF2 complexes, p&#8208;azaquinodimethane, diketopyrrolopyrrole, and barbituric acid.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic compounds display unique optical and electrical properties, rendering them appropriate for semiconducting applications. Knoevenagel condensation is one of the important reactions that facilitate the formation of olefin linkages (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) and thus has been widely employed to synthesize new &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. This review summarizes the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds constructed using four novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties: diketonate/azopyrrole&#8208;BF2 complexes (BF), p&#8208;azaquinodimethane (AQM), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and barbituric acid (BA), alongside their optoelectronic features and applications in sensing, bioimaging, and photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Nitrosoanilines Using Palladium Acetate and TBHP</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8211;catalyzed highly regioselective ortho&#8211;hydroxylation of N&#8211;nitrosoanilines has been developed, utilizing tert&#8211;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxyl source. The ortho&#8211;hydroxylation reaction proceeds with broad substrates scope to afford high yields of desired products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regiospecific ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines utilizing tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxylating source. The reaction proceeds through N&#8208;nitroso group directed C&#8722;H activation and subsequent hydroxylation at the ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provides a mild, operationally straightforward, and high&#8208;yielding transformation, offering a valuable tool for the construction of ortho&#8208;hydroxylated aniline derivatives, which are important intermediates in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry.

An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed.







Abstract
An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed. Without the need for pre&#8208;dried solvent and inert atmosphere protection, a broad range of substituted propargylamines are well&#8208;tolerated, producing the expected alkynyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans with good to high yields. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and valuable alkenyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans construction were conducted to provide a great potential value in medicinal chemistry and other related disciplines.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed, Thermally Driven [2&#960;+2&#960;]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Olefins and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally&#8208;driven, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions provide a scalable and atom&#8208;efficient strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Complementary to established photochemical methods, they tolerate electronically unbiased substrates, thereby broadening synthetic possibilities for these valuable building blocks and addressing limitations of traditional approaches. The current review summarises the concepts behind this transformation and updates the reader with the most recent advances.







Abstract
The [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of olefins and alkynes stands out as a versatile and atom&#8208;economical strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene building blocks, which are challenging to access through other synthetic methods. While photochemical approaches have traditionally dominated this field, thermally&#8208;driven methods employing transition metals offer distinct advantages, including decreased reliance on pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and improved scalability. This review explores the underlying principles of metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and highlights recent advances in thermally&#8208;driven approaches for the efficient synthesis of cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Particular attention is given to electronically unbiased substrates, which remain a significant challenge for photochemical approaches.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Excited State Switching and Fluoride Responsive Behavior of Orthogonal Spiroborate Ester Derived from Naturally Occurring &#945;&#8208;Mangostin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a sustainable and efficient method for synthesizing a spiroborate ester (MBO) from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), a natural xanthonoid isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit. The synthetic process, structural characterization and photophysical properties of MBO are thoroughly discussed. MBO exhibits an absorption band at 370 nm, with a shoulder around 410&#8208;450 nm in non&#8208;polar solvents, which shifts to 424 nm in polar protic solvents. The compound displays green to blue emission, with intensity decreasing in polar protic environments. These spectral changes result from hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted excited state switching between n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* states, as confirmed by computational studies. MBO also shows excellent anion binding properties, functioning as a dual&#8208;channel probe for both colorimetric and turn&#8208;on fluorescence detection of fluoride ions. This approach not only adds value to the residual mangosteen pericarp by converting it into a fluorescent sensor but also offers a semisynthetic, environmentally benign alternative to conventional organic receptors for fluoride detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioelective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh&#160;catalyst sample named [HRh(PPh3)4] due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh&#160;catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Organic Molecules via Intramolecular Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic compounds or heterocycles constitute the most prominent class of organic chemistry. The extensive functional utility of these compounds in pharmaceuticals and material science has led to increased research interest in this area. Since heteroatom containing molecules hold a pivotal position in both chemistry and biology, a number of methodologies have already been known for their synthesis. However, advancement in the synthetic methodology for their construction under mild reaction conditions is highly important. In the current scenario of research, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in the synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones via direct C&#8208;H functionalization. This one&#8208;pot atom&#8208;economic protocol can construct fused heterocycles that are both pharmaceutically and medicinally important. The present review focuses on transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of heteroatom containing organic molecules intramolecularly through carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) and carbon&#8208;heteroatom (C&#8208;X) bond formation reactions reported over past one decade.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Borrowing Hydrogen/Cyclization Synthesis of Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) with Salen, organic nitrogen hydroxyl groups efficiently catalyze the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of benzimidazoles from nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are an efficient toolbox of access to complex compounds, but the development of multicomponent reactions involved in benzimidazole synthesis is still limited. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction involving nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide was developed for the synthesis of benzimidazoles employing Co&#8208;complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) as catalyst, which by self&#8208;assembly from salen ligands, organic nitrogen hydroxyl compounds, and CoCl2. Compared with previously reported three&#8208;component methods for the construction of benzimidazoles, this method involves a novel hydrogen borrowing/cyclization and can provide a variety of benzimidazole in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Chemical and Biosynthetic Evolution of Quadrane and Related Sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the evolution of biosynthetic enzymes, the bioactivity&#8208;relevant chemical space of natural products has been significantly expanded. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in elucidating the intriguing chemical and biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds including humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, offering opportunities to discover novel sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.







Abstract
Natural products, with their potent bioactivities and selectivities, significantly benefit human health and agriculture. The evolution of biosynthetic enzymes of natural products has greatly expanded their chemical space relevant to bioactivity. Insights from natural evolution provide valuable guidance for engineering these enzymes to create molecules with novel structures and bioactivities. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds, indicating evolutionary relationships among sesquiterpene scaffolds such as humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, rooted in their biosynthetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of these sesquiterpenoids. These findings illuminate the logic behind the chemical and biosynthetic evolution of sesquiterpenes and offer opportunities to discover new sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.

         <title>Synthesis and Reaction Mechanisms for the Construction of Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones</title>

         <dc:description>Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones are recognized as important tricyclic scaffolds due to their diverse pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;fungi, anti&#8208;tuberculosis, and antimalarial, as well as their roles as 5&#8208;HT3 receptor agonists and kinase inhibitors targeting CK2 and AKT, and others. Developing efficient and reliable synthetic approaches to access these compounds remains an attractive goal in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, particularly focusing on strategies that maintain the A and C&#8208;rings while constructing the B&#8208;ring through the formation of a&#8208;, b&#8208;, and c&#8208;bonds. The information collected describes the two key components of the synthesis process 1&#8208;(2&#8208;substitued&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole and aldehyde or its surrogate.
This review also briefly summarizes the reaction mechanisms for the formation of tricyclic skeletons to determine the key factors governing the issues of productivity and regioselectivity. Through analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing synthetic methods, we predict that A&#8208;ring formation strategy&#8208;based pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline reactions will be developed in the future. We hope that this review will motivate the search for novel strategies to synthesize pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, accessing tricyclic skeletons that may have potential applications in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and many branches of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here we show that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate (DAP) and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen. The reaction occurs in minutes at 0&#9472;50 oC to convert carboxylic acids to acyl amidophosphate intermediates, which then undergo nitrite&#8208;promoted hydrolysis to give the corresponding acyl phosphates. The partial overlap in scope with important metabolic carboxylates and the concentrated acidic conditions likely limit its direct applicability in metabolic origins of life scenarios. Nonetheless, the work represents a step forward in understanding nonenzymatic carboxylate phosphorylation and helps clarify how the transformation might eventually be rendered compatible with a protometabolism.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward method has been developed for the direct synthesis of unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;aryl compounds from p&#8208;quinone methide (p&#8208;QM) and arylhydrazine. This reaction strategy is executed in air under basic conditions and affords exclusively Z&#8208;isomers in good yields with a broad substrate scope. The stereochemistry of our synthesized azo&#8208;arenes has been confirmed by 2D&#8208;NMR analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer Ligand Facilitated Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions hold a significant position in the field of organic synthetic chemistry as they can rapidly construct structurally diverse molecules with high atom economy. Pincer ligands possess unique structural and electronic properties, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity in multicomponent reactions. This review systematically elaborates on the research progress of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands, thoroughly discussing their mechanism of action in different reaction systems, including crucial aspects such as substrate activation modes, the formation and transformation of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, an in&#8208;depth analysis of the relationship between the structures of various pincer ligands and their reaction performance is carried out, and multiple representative reaction examples are presented, such as multicomponent transformation processes of carbon&#8208;carbon bond and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond formation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8208;pincer complexes or metal&#8208;pincer nanoclusters. Furthermore, the future development of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands are prospected. It is anticipated that they will play a more crucial role in the development of novel organic synthetic methodologies, drug synthesis, and materials science, providing valuable references and inspiration for researchers in related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Sultams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient multigram synthesis of fused sultams (up to 97 g in a single run) via the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sultams was developed. The scope and limitations of the method were studied by evaluating common 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds. The reactions with azomethine ylide (obtained from N&#8208;(methoxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine), nitrile oxides (generated from chloroximes), and nitrones worked well to give the fused heterocyclic building blocks in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. In turn, attempted reactions with allenes, azides, and several other 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds were not fruitful. A series of functional group transformations were applied to obtain fused bicyclic sultam building blocks as promising derivatives for modern drug discovery. In addition to that, antiviral activity was discovered for some representatives of the synthesized bicyclic sultams.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Enaminones in Multi&#8208;component Reactions: A Brief Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As we know, multicomponent reactions have emerged as powerful tools in organic synthesis due to their high atom and step economy, eco&#8208;friendly, diversity, convenience, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and have broad application prospects in many fields such as drug synthesis, material science and natural product synthesis. On the other side, enaminones, which contain amine&#8208;alkene&#8208;carbonyl conjugated structure possessing multiple reactive sites, have extensively served as versatile building blocks for the construction of diverse organic molecules. In this review, we describe recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini&#8208;review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Amino Acid Derivatives through Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent (2019&#8211;2025) advanced strategies in the syntheses of amino acid derivatives through multicomponent reactions, which is organized by grouping four types of catalytic strategies: transition metal catalysis, photoredox catalysis, organocatalysis and multi&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
Amino acids play significant roles in the study of life sciences, pharmaceutical R&amp;D, bioengineering, and so on. Artificial amino acid&#8208;based drugs are important in advancing therapeutic innovation for multiple diseases including chronic pain, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for the construction of complicated structures from readily accessible starting reagents in one pot. Thus, applying multicomponent reactions to the preparation of amino acids and their derivatives can be a potent strategy for advancing the research of pharmaceutical chemistry. With the rapid development of various catalytic methods and multicomponent reactions, this review outlines recent construction methods of amino acid derivatives by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;mediated and other organocatalytic multicomponent reactions.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Regiodivergent Synthesis of Functionalized Maleimides and Itaconimides via in&#8208;situ Generated Pyridinium Ylide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent approach for the synthesis of maleimides and itaconimides using pyridinium ylides. This method ensures broad substrate compatibility and excellent reproducibility.







Abstract
We report a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent synthetic strategy for the construction of functionalized maleimides and itaconimides using in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylides. This approach enables efficient access to both regioisomeric products under mild and straightforward reaction conditions. A variety of pyridinium salts with different aromatic and alkyl groups were successfully used with N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl succinimides demonstrating broad substrate compatibility. The practicality and scalability of this methodology were confirmed through scale&#8208;up experiments, which maintained high yields and reproducibility.

         <title>A New Approach Towards the Synthesis of Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Using &#945;&#8208;Diazoesters and Hydrazide Catalysed by Cu(I) Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy for the preparation of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst is reported. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilising any other metal catalyst, the unexpected imine bond formation between the terminal nitrogen of hydrazide and carbene carbon was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide.







Abstract
Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in pure form and fully characterized them using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis.

&lt;p&gt;A new synthetic strategy for the preparation of imidazol-4-ones from hydrazides and &#945;-diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst is reported. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilising any other metal catalyst, the unexpected imine bond formation between the terminal nitrogen of hydrazide and carbene carbon was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol-4-ones from hydrazides and &#945;-diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in pure form and fully characterized them using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X-Ray analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones up to a 93% yield via annulation of &#946;&#8208;oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Oligothiophenes via Subtle Changes in Donnor &#8208; Acceptor Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligothiophenes varying by their donor&#8208;acceptor sequences and displaying distinct optical and electrochemical properties were synthesized by playing with the different reactivity of &#945; and &#945;&#8217; positions of 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis and electronic properties of oligothiophenes derived from the 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene building block. By exploiting the differential reactivity of thiophene's &#945;&#8208;positions, regioisomeric derivatives were synthesized with varying donor&#8211;acceptor sequences. These derivatives displayed distinct optical and electrochemical characteristics based on the relative positions of cyano acceptor and hexyloxy donor groups. Spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical analyses revealed that substituent placement critically affects electronic properties, such as HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and band gaps. The introduction of alkoxy groups at external &#946;&#8208;sites promoted coupling reactions upon oxidation, leading to polymerization or dimerization. Conversely, cyano groups at these positions stabilized radical cations and dications, suppressing further reactions. These findings offer insights into designing conjugated systems with tunable properties, emphasizing the importance of substituent positioning for optimizing performance.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Alkyne&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition to Access Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was introduced for constructing chiral biaryls using Cu catalytic system facilitated by chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridged box ligand, using dialkynyl diaryls and azides as raw materials. This protocol offers notable advantages: simple operation, mild condition, good functional group tolerance, high yields, and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls are an important class of structural units widely used in natural product synthesis, drug design, and as ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Although significant progress has been made in the synthesis of axially chiral biaryls, some of them are still limited to narrow substrate ranges, low efficiency, and moderate stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a highly efficient route to prepare atropisomeric biaryls with triazole and alkyne modules through the desymmetrization of prochiral dialkynyl diaryls utilizing chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridge box ligands in conjunction with copper salts. The process has mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can obtain a wide array of valuable axially chiral biaryl derivatives with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed deuterodichloromethylation of olefins was developed to afford deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes in good yields. Readily accessible silacarboxylic acids were employed as halogen&#8208;atom transfer reagents and deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced deuterodichloromethylation of alkenes was developed with readily available and inexpensive deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent. Silacarboxylic acids, which could generate silyl radicals through efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation, were applied as halogen atom transfer agents. A series of deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Photocarboxylation of Arylated 2H&#8208;Azirines Exploiting Continuous Flow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous process for the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles is reported which links the photochemical opening of azirines and the subsequent trapping of the azomethine ylides with CO2 gas. This highlights challenges and solutions when incorporating CO2 as a feedstock material for the photochemical synthesis of small heterocyclic building blocks.







Abstract
A robust and efficient continuous flow set&#8208;up is presented for the orchestrated use of CO2 gas and photochemistry in flow mode. This study explores the catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition between azomethine ylides generated in&#8197;situ from simple 2H&#8208;azirines and CO2. Using UV&#8722;A light (365&#8197;nm) as energy source and CO2 as inexpensive and abundant building block provides an attractive strategy affording isomeric oxazolones which were subsequently aromatised to yield novel oxazole products in a convergent manner. Continuous flow processing substantially improves the reaction performance allowing for the safe exploitation of this intriguing transformation. This enables the effective fixation of CO2 to generate valuable building blocks that can be scaled to gram scale with ease.

This enables the effective fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate valuable building blocks that can be scaled to gram scale with ease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Strategies for the Synthesis of Functionalized Cis&#8208;Hydrindanes in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cis&#8208;hydrindanes have attracted significant interest in the scientific community due to their prevalence in natural products and relevance in medicinal chemistry. This review discusses various synthetic strategies developed since 2000 for constructing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes, with a focus on their application in natural product synthesis and highlighting their importance in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The cis&#8208;hydrindane motif is a bicyclic structure commonly found in many natural products that exhibit significant biological activity. This structural feature is present in a variety of bioactive compounds, particularly terpenoids, steroids, and alkaloids, which are known for their therapeutic potential, including anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Due to its prevalence and biological relevance, the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework has attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists, who have devoted substantial effort toward developing efficient and diverse methods for constructing this important motif. Many of the synthesized cis&#8208;hydrindane compounds have been used as key intermediates or building blocks in the total synthesis of complex natural products. This review provides an overview of strategic approaches for synthesizing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes and its derivatives from 2000 to the present day, focusing on their application in natural product synthesis. By examining the diverse methods and their impact on natural product synthesis, this review will underscore the enduring importance of the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework in both synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences.

         <title>Synthesis of (4H)&#8208;Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids, and their Antioxidant Activities using Electron Transfer Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine as potent antioxidants. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC.







Abstract
A novel series of (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones, designated as compounds 5(a&#8211;l), were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent as both catalyst and solvent. Amide intermediates were first produced via the Schotten&#8208;Baumann reaction. These intermediates then underwent cyclization in the presence of PCl3 and deep&#8208;eutectic solvent, leading to the formation of imidazolones as potent antioxidants. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC. Among the tested compounds, compound 5&#8201;i exhibited excellent antioxidant activity compared to the standard reference drugs, ascorbic acid and Trolox.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivations of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pillararene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry on the Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes showed significant impact on the asymmetric synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acids, not only altering the reactivity of the substrates but also changing the enantiomeric excess of the products. This impact was influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the type of catalyst, the kind of pillararene, and especially, the structure of the aldehyde.







Abstract
To clarify the relationship between the host&#8208;guest complexation and enantioselectivity of an asymmetric reaction, we studied the impacts of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest chemistry on the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones from aldehydes, where the aldehydes meanwhile acted as guests. The addition of different pillar[5]arenes cannot only adjust the reactivity of the substrates but also change the enantiomeric excess of the products. The magnitude of such impacts is influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the catalyst, the usage and kind of pillararenes, and the structure of aldehydes. When the pillararene&#8208;substrate interactions are strong in the reaction systems, the ee variations of products are mainly decided by the guests, aldehydes, whereas the reaction activities are mainly affected by the hosts, pillar[5]arenes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify the relationship between the host-guest complexation and enantioselectivity of an asymmetric reaction, we studied the impacts of pillar[5]arene-based host&#8211;guest chemistry on the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones from aldehydes, where the aldehydes meanwhile acted as guests. The addition of different pillar[5]arenes cannot only adjust the reactivity of the substrates but also change the enantiomeric excess of the products. The magnitude of such impacts is influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the catalyst, the usage and kind of pillararenes, and the structure of aldehydes. When the pillararene-substrate interactions are strong in the reaction systems, the ee variations of products are mainly decided by the guests, aldehydes, whereas the reaction activities are mainly affected by the hosts, pillar[5]arenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxyselenenylation of Multifunctional Homoallyl Amines and Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyselenides from N&#8208;homoallyl(hetero)arylamines and O&#8208;homoallyl(hetero)arylethers was achieved under mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. This method offers advantages of safety, ease of operation, high yields, short reaction time, and good substrate compatibility, demonstrating potential value in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyselenides from reactive N&#8208;homoallyl(hetero)arylamines and O&#8208;homoallyl(hetero)arylethers were effectively synthesized with high to excellent yields under electrolysis. The profiles of mild conditions, simple operation, short time, free of oxidants and transition metals, and good compatibilities of substrates render this methodology greener and potentially synthetic value in producing application.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Mixed Docosahexaenoic Acid Phosphatidylcholine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis method is proposed for the production of mixed DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) phosphatidylcholines, allowing access to both regioisomers with DHA positioned at either the sn1 or sn2 site. Regioisomers of acetate derivatives (AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC, stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA) and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs (antioxidant drugs) were synthesized to investigate how the positional distribution of DHA within PCs influences brain and retinal uptake.







Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22&#8201;:&#8201;6 n&#8208;3) is a critical omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with essential roles in brain and retinal functions. Its selective uptake into these tissues is mediated by several pathways, including the transporter Mfsd2a, which preferentially utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine&#8208;DHA (LPC&#8208;DHA) as a substrate. Due to the low de novo synthesis of DHA, optimizing its dietary intake and exploring novel delivery strategies are important in pathologies that affect PUFA proportion. The present work focuses on developing an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic methodology to access structured mixed DHA phosphatidylcholines (mixed DHA&#8208;PCs), valuable biological tools for enhancing drug and/or DHA delivery to the brain and retina. Chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods were established to synthesize mixed sn1&#8208; or sn2&#8208;DHA&#8208;PC isomers, to study the importance of DHA position, from cost&#8208;effective glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC). The approach aligns with green chemistry principles by leveraging lipase&#8208;catalyzed regioselective acylation and deacylation reactions, thus reducing the number of chemical steps compared to traditional methods. The resulting mixed PCs AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC (stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA), and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs were produced at a scale suitable for future in&#8197;vivo studies, enabling investigations into the positional effect of DHA on brain and retinal uptake.

         <title>Mechanochemical Dissociation of Singlet Carbene&#8211;CS2 Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical release of carbon disulfide (CS2) from singlet carbene&#8211;CS&#8322; adducts is explored. While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC) adducts exhibit complete conversion, cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) adduct undergoes decomposition. DFT calculations reveal how electronic structure influences CS2 release, offering insights into the reactivity of singlet carbenes&#8211;small molecule adducts.







Abstract
Owing to the extensive application of singlet carbenes, their generation through the release of small molecules from stable adducts is attracting increasing research interest. This study explores the mechanochemical release of CS2 from Carbene&#8211;CS2 adducts formed by three distinct singlet carbenes: cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC); N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC); and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC). Under ball&#8208;milling conditions, these adducts exhibit notably different reactivities; DAC&#8211;CS2 releases CS2 completely within 20&#8197;min, NHC&#8211;CS2 has a slower release rate, while CAAC&#8211;CS2 decomposes into a complex mixture. DFT calculations reveal that the release of CS2 from CAAC&#8211;CS2 requires the highest activation energy (32&#8197;kcal/mol), suggesting that it is inaccessible under the reaction conditions. This is likely because of the higher HOMO energy of CAAC, which correlates with a stronger bond with CS2, thereby limiting its dissociation. This study highlights how the electronic structures of carbenes influence their interactions with small molecules, paving the way for controlling the reactivity of carbene&#8211;small&#8208;molecule adducts.

         <dc:description>
Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols to afford &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyl ketone derivatives. The key of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes and the generation of unprecedented sulfoxonium ylide radical upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols is reported. The core of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes. Upon photo&#8208;activation, IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides in&#8208;situ generates sulfoxonium ylide radical, which is trapped by thiophenes to generate &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;ketyl sulfoxonium ylides and initiated subsequent carbenic O&#8722;H insertion from alcohol component. All reactions are operationally simple and proceed smoothly under mild reaction conditions, affording a broad range of unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in moderate to good yields.

The core of the strategy involves electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex formation between I&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;-ylides and electron-rich thiophenes. Upon photo-activation, I&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;-ylides &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; generates sulfoxonium ylide radical, which is trapped by thiophenes to generate &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-thienyl-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-ketyl sulfoxonium ylides and initiated subsequent carbenic O&#8722;H insertion from alcohol component. All reactions are operationally simple and proceed smoothly under mild reaction conditions, affording a broad range of unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;-disubstituted ketones in moderate to good yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigations into Intramolecular Cerium&#8208; and Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Styryl Moieties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese catalysis affords oxidative radical cyclizations of &#947;&#8208;allyl &#946;&#8208;oxoesters in an atmosphere of air. The mediately formed peroxides are either reduced with zinc&#8211;acetic acid to yield tricylic lactones as final products. Alternatively, the peroxides are treated with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine to furnish bicyclic scaffolds with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl substructure in a subsequent Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation.







Abstract
Bicyclic diketones and lactones are obtained in up to 60&#8201;% yield in the aerobic, manganese&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular radical cyclization of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a six&#8208;membered ring and phenyl or diphenyl allyl substituents in the &#947;&#8208;position. Intermediate products of this transformation are peroxides, which are processed either reductively with zinc&#8211;acetic acid or by Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation (with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine). The respective congeners with five&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings either undergo only &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation reactions or mixtures of various cyclization products are obtained in low yields. In this study, also cerium&#8208;catalysis was investigated, however, the yields are lower compared to manganese catalysis. The relative configurations of all racemic products were established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analyses.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Directly&#8208;Linked Perylene Dimer from a 2,5,8,11&#8208;Tetraborylated Perylene</title>

While synthesizing a tetra&#8208;substituted perylene, we also made a hexa&#8208;substituted perylene dimer for the first time. It'll be a new way to create dimers bonding less reactive positions, making good use of the side reaction of cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
One&#8208;step Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 2,5,8,11&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated perylene with 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)bromo&#8208;benzene gave 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked perylene dimer for the first time in 7.3&#8201;% yield under the standard conditions. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure exhibits three independent dimers in the unit cell, reflecting the low rotational energy around 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linkage. Excited state properties of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimer were compared with the corresponding 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked congener. The facile synthetic method developed in this study could be a general route to access polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oligomers linked at less reactive positions.

This manuscript describes a surfactant&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones with indoles in water, mediated by dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid.

Abstract
The surfactant&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones with indoles was investigated in an aqueous medium for the synthesis of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles. The reaction was carried out in the presence of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, which was initiated by two consecutive nucleophilic additions of indoles to the aldehyde group of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones, followed by a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and dehydrative aromatization. This protocol afforded the desired products in good yields under mild conditions and demonstrated a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;Guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From radical initiation to dimer formation, the radical coupling reaction profile of Juncus acutus phenanthrenoids is mapped through a two&#8208;state mechanism, involving a triplet intermediate. This study offers crucial insights into the dimerization process, using computational methods to uncover molecular mechanisms and highlight the role of water in facilitating keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, advancing our understanding of biosynthesis in plants.







Abstract
Juncus acutus is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and in solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.

         <title>On the Synthesis of [1,3]Azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)lines and 2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides</title>

         <dc:description>
Syntheses of quinoline and quinoxaline derivatives fused with phosphacycles were developed from commercially available quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine.







Abstract
Despite their potential in areas such as medicinal chemistry and organic materials, scaffolds in which quinoline and quinoxaline are fused to phosphacycles such as 1,3&#8208;oxaphosphole, 1,3&#8208;azaphosphole, P&#8208;arylated and P&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;azaphosphole P&#8208;oxides have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this study we have developed a synthetic approach to [1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines from quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine. These were converted to 5&#8208;phosphanylquino(xa)lin&#8208;6&#8208;amines by regioselective iodination in position 5, cross&#8208;coupling with diethyl phosphite and reduction. Formation of the azaphosphole ring was then achieved by reaction with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. Attempts at C&#8722;H arylation in position 2 did not lead to the desired derivatives but rather to 1&#8208;arylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides. Access to 1&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinoline 1&#8208;oxides was also developed using as key steps cross&#8208;coupling with ethyl phosphinate formed in&#8197;situ and the subsequent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction.

     alt="On the Synthesis of [1,3]Azaphospholo[4,5-f]quino(xa)lines and 2,3-Dihydro-[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5-f]quino(xa)line 1-oxides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntheses of quinoline and quinoxaline derivatives fused with phosphacycles were developed from commercially available quinolin-6-amine and quinoxalin-6-amine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their potential in areas such as medicinal chemistry and organic materials, scaffolds in which quinoline and quinoxaline are fused to phosphacycles such as 1,3-oxaphosphole, 1,3-azaphosphole, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-arylated and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxylated 2,3-dihydro-1,3-azaphosphole &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-oxides have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this study we have developed a synthetic approach to [1,3]azaphospholo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]quinolines and -quinoxalines from quinolin-6-amine and quinoxalin-6-amine. These were converted to 5-phosphanylquino(xa)lin-6-amines by regioselective iodination in position 5, cross-coupling with diethyl phosphite and reduction. Formation of the azaphosphole ring was then achieved by reaction with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. Attempts at C&#8722;H arylation in position 2 did not lead to the desired derivatives but rather to 1-arylated 2,3-dihydro-[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]quino(xa)line 1-oxides. Access to 1-alkoxylated 2,3-dihydro-[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]quinoline 1-oxides was also developed using as key steps cross-coupling with ethyl phosphinate formed &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; and the subsequent Kabachnik-Fields reaction. The resulting tricyclic compounds were finally tested against a panel of disease-related protein kinases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Reactivity of Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene towards Dichalcogenide Bonds, IPr Carbene, 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylphenyl Isocyanide and Trimethylsilyl Azide</title>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene 1 towards small molecules was investigated, yielding a handful of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives.







Abstract
The development of phosphinidene precursors capable of releasing free phosphinidenes holds great potential in exploiting their reactivity with small molecules and enthalpically strong bonds. We report the facile cleavage of dichalcogenide bonds, including S&#8722;S, Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonded complexes over the phosphorus center of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (1), which produces a variety of phosphonodichalcogenides (2&#8208;4). We also show the ambiphilic nature of 1. The reaction of 1 with nucleophiles, such as 1,3&#8208;bis(isopropyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IiPr) and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl isocyanide (DipNC) gives a phosphinidene adduct of IiPr and a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;3&#8208;azaallene, respectively. Treatment of 1 with trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) affords an iminophosphanide, manifesting the nucleophilic nature of 1. These compounds were fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and spectroscopic analysis.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Alkyl enol Ether Synthesis via Microwave&#8208;Promoted, Base&#8208;Catalysed Alkyne Hydroalkoxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the synthesis of alkyl enol ethers was developed, based upon microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation, requiring only alkyne and alcohol components and mild base catalysis. The reaction displayed broad substrate tolerance and was highly selective for Z&#8208;configured, anti&#8208;Markovnikov enol ether products.







Abstract
The diverse reactivity presented by alkyl enol ethers underpins a wide range of synthetically significant processes. Their synthesis is often achieved by atom&#8208;economical alkyne hydroalkoxylation (i.&#8201;e., addition of an alcohol across an alkyne), either using superbasic conditions or transition metal catalysis. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions of the former approach limit substrate tolerance whilst the latter approach often requires inert, anhydrous conditions and exotic, expensive catalysts. In order to pursue more convenient, general and sustainable methodology for enol ether synthesis, we have developed microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation as an attractive solution. Our optimised conditions employ caesium carbonate as a mild base catalyst and the required alcohol as solvent and reagent, with reaction temperatures from 20&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C and reaction times from 10&#8211;60 minutes. We have demonstrated that the reaction shows broad tolerance of diverse substrate functionality (e.&#8201;g., ester, ether, carboxylate, nitrile, nitro, halide), including examples of terminal, internal, aryl and alkyl alkynes. Greatest reactivity is observed with electron&#8208;poor alkyne substrates, and the reaction shows near&#8208;complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity and a very strong stereochemical bias towards Z&#8208;configured enol ether products. These observations are consistent with a polar mechanism proceeding via a vinyl anion intermediate, and we provide empirical and computation evidence in support of this.

A refresh of the well&#8208;known myo&#8208;inositol chemistry is reported with a special focus on 2&#8208;O&#8208;alkylated compounds, chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose, 1,2&#8208;diketone and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;diketone derivatives optimizing the synthetic protocol also in gram scale. Orthogonally protected chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose was transformed into cyanohydrins to access to poly&#8208;hydroxylated&#8208;(aminomethyl)cyclohexane compounds.







Abstract
A refresh and improvement of the well&#8208;known myo&#8208;inositol chemistry is reported here, setting up a new synthetic protocol to obtain orthogonally protected compounds, with a special focus on the preparation of 2&#8208;O&#8208;alkylated compounds. A gram scale synthesis of the 2&#8208;allyl compound was performed and optimized in terms of yield. This intermediate is the precursor of chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose, for which synthetic procedures are lacking. Taking advantage of the easily handled allyl group, we were able to transform this keto compound into both the 1,2&#8208;diketone and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;diketone, intermediates of biological transformations used in several patented applications. Finally, to access poly&#8208;hydroxylated&#8208;(aminomethyl)cyclohexane compounds, the reaction of the keto compound with cyanide was optimized, affording cyanohydrins obtained as single stereoisomer, the precursor of the above compound.

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Mediated by Supramolecular Containers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of supramolecular container mediated multicomponent reactions have been reviewed. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+). The multicomponent reactions cover Hantzsch, Biginelli, aza&#8208;Darzens, Strecker, and other three&#8208;component reactions. Effects of the supramolecular container has been illustrated and prospects for the future are also provided.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have drawn great attention due to their various significant advantages including highly efficient, environment&#8208;friendly, and atom&#8208;economic. Developing more efficient and selective MCRs is of great significance to construct chemical libraries of potential functional compounds. On the other hand, supramolecular containers have been successfully applied as novel nanoreactors to mediate diverse organic transformations, and MCRs are included. In this review, examples of supramolecular container mediated MCRs have been summarized. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+).

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence Solvatochromism of Push&#8208;Pull Type Indenoindene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO demonstrated the effectiveness of structurally rigid planar COPV platform for full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism. Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 achieved a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) &#8805;0.90 in aprotic solvents, with a 0.74&#8197;eV shift between cyclohexane and methanol. [Ph&#8322;N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]&#8322;CO demonstrated lower PLQY but enhanced sensitivity to water content and extinction coefficient of up to 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism was demonstrated using two carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO with a push&#8211;pull system, where the donor and acceptor moieties are diphenylamino and a carbonyl group, respectively. In non&#8208;polar cyclohexane, the molecules exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#955;PL=443 and 464&#8197;nm) with a locally excited character, while in polar solvents, a charge&#8208;transfer character emerged. In methanol, red emission was observed (&#955;PL=602 and 572&#8197;nm). The difference in luminescence maxima between cyclohexane and methanol corresponds to 0.74 and 0.59&#8197;eV for Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO, respectively, which are larger than those of previously reported push&#8211;pull systems. The photoluminescence quantum yields of Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 in aprotic solvents were 0.90 and higher regardless of solvent polarity, while they decreased in protic solvents. The molecules also display high extinction coefficients of up to 2.8x104 and 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of structurally rigid planar COPV framework. Furthermore, [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO showed significant responses to water content in tetrahydrofuran&#8208;water mixed solvents, which highlights its potential for sensing applications.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Azidative Functionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes is a powerful way to produce valuable chiral alkyl azides. This review summarizes the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes over the past quarter of a century. Four reaction models, including conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer, are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Aliphatic azides are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds found in numerous biologically active molecules. Besides, they also serve as useful building blocks owning to their remarkable reactivities. Catalytic azidation of alkenes is an efficient way to produce aliphatic azides. In this respect, azidated chiral molecules can be formed if a chiral catalyst is used. The last quarter of century has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes to yield chiral alkyl azides. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes systematically, from the view of reaction models (conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer) combining the roles that azido sources play (nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical). This review will be useful to the fields of azide chemistry and asymmetric alkene functionalization.

         <title>Urea as an Amine Source to Synthesize Primary Aromatic Amines via Nickel&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an efficient and regiospecific approach for the direct synthesis of primary aromatic amines through nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H amination, utilizing urea &#8211; an abundant, non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical &#8211; as a sustainable amine source. This method eliminates the need for conventional protection and deprotection steps, offering a streamlined solution for the amination of arenes.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient method has been developed for the transformation of aromatic CAr&#8722;H bond into CAr&#8722;NH&#8322; via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation, eliminating the need for additional protection and deprotection steps. This strategy employs 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a directing group and urea as the nitrogen source, a non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical. The reaction exhibits high selectivity, exclusively yielding mono&#8208;aminated primary aromatic amines. Furthermore, the protocol is tolerant of a wide range of substrates with various functional groups, producing the corresponding ortho&#8208;aminobenzamides in yields ranging from 38&#8201;% to 73&#8201;%. The preliminary results indicate the C&#8722;H bond cleavage is likely the rate&#8208;determining step in the reaction.

&lt;p&gt;We present an efficient and regiospecific approach for the direct synthesis of primary aromatic amines through nickel-mediated C&#8722;H amination, utilizing urea &#8211; an abundant, non-toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical &#8211; as a sustainable amine source. This method eliminates the need for conventional protection and deprotection steps, offering a streamlined solution for the amination of arenes.

This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in multicomponent reactions of indoles from 2014 to 2024, focusing on site&#8208;selective synthesis strategies, catalytic systems, reaction mechanisms and their applications in constructing various indole derivatives, and also discusses the future development trends in this field.







Abstract
Indoles, which are distinguished by their nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic structure, play a pivotal role in organic chemistry due to their diverse biological profiles and unique chemical reactivity. In particular, poly&#8208;substituted indoles are extensively found in a wide range of natural products, pharmaceuticals, materials, and bioactive compounds. The integration of indoles into multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has emerged as a powerful synthetic strategy, facilitating the construction of these complex poly&#8208;substituted indole frameworks from simple precursors. This review highlights the latest advancements in MCRs involving indoles, focusing on innovative methodologies for site&#8208;selective synthesis of indole derivatives, catalytic systems, mechanistic insights, and their applications. The review encompasses significant developments from 2014 to 2024 and covers a variety of indole MCRs, including those targeting the C3 position, dual&#8208;site reactions at the C2 and C3 positions, and reactions involving the pyrrole and benzene rings of the indole scaffold.

         <title>A Platinum(0) Complex as &#960;&#8208;Lewis Base Catalyst for Asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt0 complex functions as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to promote the asymmetric Friedel&#8722;Crafts reaction of unsaturated carbonyl&#8208;tethered heteroarenes upon dihapto&#8208;coordination, and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity is achieved.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate that a Pt0 complex can function as an efficient &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of deactivated heteroarenes upon &#951;2&#8208;coordination and resultant &#960;&#8208;backdonation, thus enabling asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with electrophiles. A diversity of densely functionalized adducts are produced in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Preliminary frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations and in&#8197;situ 1H NMR analysis support the Pt0 &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalytic mode.

&lt;p&gt;A Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex functions as a &#960;-Lewis base catalyst to promote the asymmetric Friedel&#8722;Crafts reaction of unsaturated carbonyl-tethered heteroarenes upon dihapto-coordination, and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrate that a Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex can function as an efficient &#960;-Lewis base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of deactivated heteroarenes upon &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination and resultant &#960;-backdonation, thus enabling asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reaction with electrophiles. A diversity of densely functionalized adducts are produced in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Preliminary frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations and in&#8197;situ &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR analysis support the Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &#960;-Lewis base catalytic mode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing 6&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes: Bicyclic Piperidine Analogs for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are proposed as advanced building blocks for early drug discovery programs. For this purpose, their straightforward multigram synthesis, physicochemical, and structural characterization were performed. Effects of fluorine&#8208;containing substituents and the bicyclic system on the compound's pKa, LogP, and conformational behavior in the crystalline state were demonstrated.







Abstract
Convenient synthetic approaches to a series of fluorinated bicyclic piperidine analogs (including 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;, 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes) were proposed. Using commercially available fluorination agents, the target building blocks were prepared in gram to decagram scale in a single run. Evaluation of pKa and LogP values revealed the importance of the fluorine&#8208;containing substituent and methylene bridge relative disposition for the compound's physicochemical properties. Analysis of molecular structure using the exit vector plot (EVP) approach revealed negligible change in molecules conformation upon fluorination.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems Based on Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) cores were employed to develop acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores. These compounds demonstrated extensive visible&#8208;light absorption and complex redox properties, including &#960;&#8208;dimer and mixed&#8208;valence formations. Computational studies revealed tunable electronic transitions, while preliminary solar cell tests led to promising efficiency, showcasing IDT&#8208;TTF's as a versatile donor unit for organic electronics.







Abstract
Here, we present a series of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8722;D&#8208;A) conjugated molecules incorporating an indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) as the central electron&#8208;donating moiety, functionalized with various lateral electron acceptors. A key synthetic step was the Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack formylation of the IDT&#8208;TTF, providing the dialdehyde in quantitative yield. This compound was further used for the incorporation of dicyanovinyl and indanedione acceptors. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy of the A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds in solution revealed a broad absorption in the visible spectrum which is further red&#8208;shifted when proceeding from solutions to thin films. Their cyclic voltammograms in solution showed a multi&#8208;redox behavior &#8211; undergoing both oxidation and reduction events. Notably, the oxidation of these compounds unveiled the formation of intermolecular mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species, especially strong in the case of the indanedione&#8208;containing derivative. Computational calculations helped us to identify the electronic transitions involved in the main absorption bands of these A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds displaying different behaviors depending on the acceptor attached to the IDT&#8208;TTF core. Finally, the potential of these compounds as donors in organic solar cells was investigated and the best performing solar cell exhibited a modest yet promising power conversion efficiency of 0.87&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in the &#945;&#8208;Hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;Amination) of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, notable progress has been achieved in the &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds, especially in the direct asymmetric electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination with dialkyl azodicarboxylates. This review summarizes all the methods that appeared over the past decade, categorized based on the type of the reactive chiral intermediate (enamine, enol, enolate). Other reaction types are discussed at the end.







Abstract
The electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (generally referred to as &#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds with dialkyl azodicarboxylates is a powerful approach for the preparation of synthetically useful intermediates such as &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes and ketones, &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Many methods for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination have been published in the past and many new approaches have been disclosed in the last decade that deal with previously unresolved issues such as the direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination of &#945;&#8208;branched ketones. The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination is the field where most significant advances have been attained thanks to new approaches, catalysts and techniques. With this review we intend to cover the literature that appeared between 2015 and 2024. We will classify the various methods according to the strategies for the enantioselective formation of the new C&#8722;N bond, mainly based on the formation of chiral enamines, enols and enolates. Miscellaneous methods are grouped at the end of the review. Where relevant, the application of &#945;&#8208;hydrazino carbonyl compounds to the synthesis of target molecules will also be illustrated.

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>

This review summarized the advances in photo-mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
