         <title>Synthesis of Heterocycles from 2&#8208;Acylbenzoic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclics are the crucial scaffolds present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, biologically active compounds and agrochemicals. Consequently, the development of simple and practical methods for constructing heterocyclics has always been a fascinating field in organic synthesis. Recently, 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids as highly reactive and versatile synthons have been broadly applied in the construction of heterocycles due to their multiple reaction sites. In this review, we summarized recent progress in the application of 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids for the synthesis of heterocycles including phthalides, isochromanones, isoindolines, phthalazinones, and quinolones. The sub&#8208;strate scopes, proposed mechanisms, and product application of different types of reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regioselective synthesis of N&#8208;fused benzimidazo&#8208;indolo&#8208;isoquinoline heterocycles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino coupling reaction of 1&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazoles and aryl halides was developed. This one pot methodology proceeded via five&#8208;member carbopalladacycle intermediate and provided direct and facile route to access structurally complex polyheterocycles in moderate to good yields. These unique hybrid molecules resembled structural similarity with naturally isolated alkaloids. Notably, the present domino process occurred through activation of three C&#8208;H bonds and the simultaneous formation of two new C&#8208;C bonds in one&#8208;shot. These molecules exhibited strong solid and solution phase fluorescence and their emission spectra in both the medium are reported here.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrazoloazepines from 5&#8208;Aminopyrazoles and Study of Their Cytotoxicity in Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research expands upon the synthesis of 1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]azepines by optimization of reaction conditions for N&#8208;substituted 1,8&#8208;dihydropyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]azepine derivatives. Structures are confirmed by 2D NMR analysis. The obtained derivatives are tested for their potential cytotoxic effect using mouse and human leukem







Abstract
The novel synthetic approach was employed to synthesize a series of 1,8&#8208;dihydropyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]azepine derivatives from 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles in three&#8208;step synthesis. The structures of the individual derivatives were unambiguously confirmed by spectral methods, including heteronuclear 1H&#8722;13C HMBC spectra and other necessary 2D NMR experiments. The obtained pyrazoloazepines and starting aminopyrazoles were subsequently investigated for their potential cytotoxic effect using mouse and human leukemia cell models. The original L1210 (mouse lymphoblastic), MOLM&#8208;13, and SKM&#8208;1 (both human myeloblastic) cell lines and their P&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) expressing cell variants were used. Aminopyrazole 8 was the most effective on murine leukemic lymphoblasts (L1210), while it had a greater effect on P&#8208;gp expressing cells. In contrast, on human leukemic myeloblasts (MOLM&#8208;13, SKM&#8208;1), Aminopyrazoles 10 showed the most pronounced effect, but this was independent of the presence of P&#8208;gp in the cells.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Insertion of Sulfur Dioxide Mediated by Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Indolizines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 22, June 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, photocatalyst&#8208;free sulfonylation of indolizines are developed thanks to an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex approach. The formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds, without further pre&#8208;functionnalization, in metal&#8208;free and mild conditions renders this three&#8208;component approach sustainable and green. The newly 3&#8208;sulfonylated indolizines show promising photophysical properties with high fluorescence and large Stokes shifts.







Abstract
This work investigates a light&#8208;driven 3&#8208;component sulfonylation reaction of indolizines without needing any external photocatalyst. The mechanistic investigations support the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex in&#8197;situ. This transformation offers a mild and sustainable approach with high functional group tolerance for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfonylated indolizines. This compound class has valuable photophysical properties and represents promising candidates in various applications related to fluorescence.

         <dc:description>
The construction of intriguing scaffolds through the recombination of natural products fragments are important both in organic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, a basicity&#8208;controlled synthesis of (dihydro)furo[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives through (3+2) cyclization between 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and &#946;&#8208;chlorinated nitrostyrenes was developed.







Abstract
The construction of novel skeletons through the recombination of natural products ring systems is attractive. Herein, a basicity&#8208;controlled synthesis of (dihydro)furo[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives through (3+2) cyclization between 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and &#946;&#8208;chlorinated nitrostyrenes was developed. In addition, preliminary study gave the chiral dihydrofuro[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives with up to 83&#8201;%&#8201;ee.

Difluoroboryl chelate complexes derived from hydrazones serve as good substrates in reactions with alkyl radicals generated under photoredox conditions.







Abstract
Five&#8208;membered difluoroboryl chelate complexes are competent substrates for radical reactions with various radical precursors including potassium trifluoroborates, bis(catecholato)siliconates, 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted Hantzsch esters, dihydroquinazolinones, esters of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide, Katritzky salts, alkyl iodides and thiols. Using these reagents, primary, secondary, and tertiary radicals can be generated under oxidative or reductive conditions and add at the C=N bond of the difluoroboryl chelates leading to hydrazide products.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic and Fused Isoxazoline Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 22, June 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of fused and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;enriched isoxazoline building blocks via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of functionalized chloroximes and cyclic alkenes is disclosed. The target compounds are prepared on a multigram scale, and their potential for further functionalization is revealed.







Abstract
A highly efficient multigram synthesis of spirocyclic and fused isoxazoline building blocks is described. Isoxazoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates were synthesized via a regioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)acetate and carbo&#8208; or heterocyclic alkenes bearing endo&#8208; or exocyclic C=C double bonds, resulting in fused or spirocyclic isoxazolines, respectively. The preparation of up to 300&#8197;g of these compounds was achieved in a single run. The ester group of isoxazolines was then subjected to common synthetic transformations for the synthesis of corresponding building blocks, including alcohols, chlorides, azides, amines, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, amino acids and their derivatives, difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds, and bicyclic &#947;&#8208;lactones. Additionally, a direct cycloaddition&#8208;based approach to the synthesis of aminoalkyl&#8208; and chloromethyl&#8208;substituted isoxazolines was proposed to improve their preparation. The described isoxazoline building blocks are expected to be valuable tools for drug discovery.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of title compounds were accomplished by a reaction of vinyl malononitriles and arylidene pyrazolones catalyzed by base. This protocol proceeds via Michael addition followed by intramolecular cyclization leading to the formation of two new C&#8722;C bonds. Further the same reaction was also conducted with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyano olefins and vinyl malononitriles to furnish 1,6&#8208;dihydro biphenyl compounds. Simple reaction conditions, high yields and compatibility are the advantages of this protocol.

The depletion of finite primary fossil fuels makes necessary a progressive transition from finite primary fossil sources to alternative renewable raw materials to produce high value chemicals important for our everyday life. Greener processes must be designed to face the current challenge of climate change. In this context, organocatalysis offers a valuable opportunity for upgrading bio&#8208;derived platform compounds in the frame of green and sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The depletion of finite primary fossil fuels we are facing makes necessary a deep metamorphosis in fundamental parts of the chemical industry. A progressive transition from petro&#8208;based starting materials toward renewable biomass&#8208;derived sources will have to take place in the synthesis of added&#8208;value chemicals, important for our everyday life, such as pharmaceuticals, polymers, agrochemicals etc. Moreover, greener processes, carried out under friendlier reaction conditions, must be designed to address current concerns about the climate change and the resulting pressing need to reduce the environmental footprint of chemical processes. To this end, organocatalysis could offer a valuable opportunity for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived platform molecules in line with the principles of Green Chemistry. This review presents some of recent and remarkable advancements in this emerging area. Organocatalysis has proven to be an efficient tool to transform low value bio&#8208;based renewable platform building blocks into new high value bio&#8208;based chemicals, with potential applications as synthetic intermediates, innovative materials and pharmaceutically active compounds.

         <title>Stereoselective Mannich Reactions in the Synthesis of Enantiopure Piperidine Alkaloids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 22, June 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent syntheses of enantiopure pharmaceutically relevant piperidines using Mannich reactions is presented. The asymmetric induction has been classified in three conceptual approaches using the chiral pool, chiral auxilliaries and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Piperidine alkaloids are members of the alkaloid family that is characterized by the presence of a six&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle. Piperidine alkaloids are found mainly in plants and often exhibit interesting biological and pharmacological activities.

Of each approach, we describe the reaction mechanism and rationalize the stereochemical outcome of the Mannich products.

     alt="Stereoselective Mannich Reactions in the Synthesis of Enantiopure Piperidine Alkaloids and Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of recent syntheses of enantiopure pharmaceutically relevant piperidines using Mannich reactions is presented. The asymmetric induction has been classified in three conceptual approaches using the chiral pool, chiral auxilliaries and asymmetric catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piperidine alkaloids are members of the alkaloid family that is characterized by the presence of a six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Piperidine alkaloids are found mainly in plants and often exhibit interesting biological and pharmacological activities. Despite the accumulation of these natural products in plants, relatively low quantities of alkaloids are produced in absolute terms and thus synthesis of alkaloids and derivatives thereof remains relevant to identify targets for drug discovery. Throughout the years, researchers have come up with a myriad of methods to synthesize piperidine derivatives. This review describes methods that employ stereoselective Mannich reactions to create the core of piperidine alkaloids. Asymmetric induction in the Mannich reaction has been achieved by a range of methods that have been divided into three conceptual approaches: (1)&#8197;chiral pool-based (internal asymmetric induction), (2)&#8197;chiral auxiliary-based (relayed asymmetric induction) and (3)&#8197;asymmetric catalysis-based (external asymmetric induction). Of each approach, we describe the reaction mechanism and rationalize the stereochemical outcome of the Mannich products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Dithienopyrazines: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient preparation and investigation of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;dithienopyrazines, which were func&#8208;tionalized with triaraylamine units to provide four different series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type materials, is reported. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties gave insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. An application of a dithienopyrazine derivative as model for hole&#8208;transport materials tailored for organic electronic devices has been realized.







Abstract
Dithienopyrazines are only scarcely used as building blocks in organic electronic materials. Here, we report efficient preparation and investigation of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;dithienopyrazines, which were functionalized with triaraylamine units to provide different series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type materials. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties resulted in valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and allowed for the elucidation of the influence of structural effects such as core structure (syn vs anti), type of substituents (directly arylated vs ethynylated aryl), and substitution pattern (&#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208; vs &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208; vs fourfold substitution). Finally, first application of a dithienopyrazine derivative as model for hole&#8208;transport materials tailored for organic electronic devices has been realized.

         <title>Employing Click Chemistry to Expand the Scope of the Metal&#8208;Free Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Type Photocatalyst 4CzIPN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is reported to overcome the limited applicability of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts by implementing four exposed alkyne groups on the well&#8208;known structure motif of 4CzIPN. It is demonstrated that the modification enables the synthesis of new organic photocatalysts with unique redox features and paves the way for further targeted functionalisation.







Abstract
The design of a versatile alkyne&#8208;bearing derivative of the donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophore 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN) suitable for further targeted modifications by copper&#8208;catalysed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC) is reported. The newly synthesised photoredox catalyst notably exhibits analogously unique photoelectronic and steric features as the well&#8208;established carbazolyl dicyanobenzene motif and performs equally in a C&#8722;C&#8208;Coupling model reaction. Furthermore, the variability of this donor&#8208;acceptor system was demonstrated by the generation of a library of fourteen photoredox catalysts with electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating groups as well as residues with high steric demands in one simple and selective CuAAC reaction. The modified catalysts feature a broad scope of reducing and oxidising powers in their excited states (span of reducing powers over more than 1&#8197;V) and were also successfully applied in the photoredox and nickel&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative cross coupling model reaction. This work represents a method to overcome the limitations in the flexibility of metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores required for the targeted application in organic synthesis and paves the way for the design of customised catalysts with multiple functionalities.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Monofluorinated Carbocyclic Alcohols and Vicinal Difluorinated Heterocycles and Carbocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward access to novel families of enantioenriched cis&#8208;monofluorinated carbocyclic alcohols has been developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/dynamic kinetic resolution that proceeded in high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Valuable enantioenriched vicinal difluorinated heterocycles and carbocycles, such as trans&#8208;difluorinated indans, tetrahydronaphthalenes, tetrahydroquinolines and chromans have been synthesized as well by deoxofluorination of the corresponding cis&#8208;fluoro alcohols.







Abstract
A straightforward method to access novel families of enantioenriched cis&#8208;monofluorinated carbocyclic alcohols has been developed through ATH/DKR in up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and enantioinductions up to 97&#8201;% ee. Trans&#8208;difluorinated indans, tetrahydronaphthalenes, tetrahydroquinolines and chromans have been synthesized as well by deoxofluorination of the corresponding cis&#8208;fluoro alcohols. The reaction was performed on a series of variously substituted 3&#8208;fluorochromanols, 3&#8208;fluorotetrahydroquinolinols, 2&#8208;fluoro inden&#8208;1&#8208;ols and 2&#8208;fluoro 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ols in up to 86&#8201;% yields, with diastereoselectivities up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 and enantioselectivities up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.

         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free selective protocol has been developed for the direct synthesis of chiral directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazoles with two adjacent tertiary&#8208;quaternary stereocenters through asymmetric Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;isocyanoacetates with N&#8208;(2&#8208;benzothiazolyl)imines catalyzed by dihydroquinine&#8208;derived squaramide under the mild conditions for the first time.







Abstract
An organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazoles with two adjacent tertiary&#8208;quaternary stereocenters through a Mannich&#8208;type reaction of isocyanoacetates with N&#8208;(2&#8208;benzothiazolyl)imines is disclosed. When employing bifunctional dihydroquinine&#8208;derived squaramide as catalyst, moderate to excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;% yield), moderate diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were obtained for a variety of substrates. In addition, the transformation of the resulted directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazole into highly functionalized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino esters was also demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis of an Octacyclic C60 Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragments of buckminsterfullerene (C60) include the monumental three compounds corannulene, sumanene, and truxene.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragments of buckminsterfullerene (C60) include the monumental three compounds corannulene, sumanene, and truxene. These three have served as leading molecules in ongoing research for curved, fused, and&#160;&#960;-extended polyaromatic materials. Achieving more structural variations that join the ranks of these three archetypes remains challenging. Herein we report synthesis of an octacyclic hydrocarbon that is an unexplored C60-fragment, namely, a 4,11-dihydrodiindeno[7,1,2-ghi:7&#8217;,1&#8217;,2&#8217;-pqr]chrysene (C28H16, which we named Metelykene).

         <title>Multifaceted Behavior of 2&#8208;Cyanobenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;Acylbenzonitriles in the Synthesis of Isoindolinones, Phthalides and Related Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy access to several classes of heterocyclic compounds is provided by reacting 2&#8208;cyanobenzaldehyde or 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles with a range of nucleophiles under mild conditions through divergent cascade reactions in an asymmetric way.







Abstract
2&#8208;Cyanobenzaldehye (also called 2&#8208;formylbenzonitrile) and related 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles belong to a class of bifunctional aromatic compounds that emerged as useful starting materials in developing efficient cascade&#8208;type reactions leading to different heterocyclic compounds. The variety of sometimes unpredictable mechanisms that rise from these structurally simple starting materials renders this class of compounds unique to afford, through divergent cascade reactions, heterocycles like isoindolinones, phthalides (also known with the name of isobenzofuranones), imidates, and in less extent isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;imine, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, porphyrins, also in asymmetric way exploiting different organocatalytic activation modes. To give a picture, this chemistry can be associated to Goldberg variations which stem from a common motive in a pressing and surprising way. In this Review, emphasis is also given to the synthetic methods for the access to substituted 2&#8208;cyanobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles which allowed to enlarge the scope of the described cascade reactions.

         <title>Photoinduced Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Bromoacetophenone with Thiosulfonate: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Thiosulfone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light promoted radical reaction between &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone and thiosulfate has been reported. Two C&#8722;S bonds or one C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;Se bond can be stably constructed and the thiosulfonate is fully utilised with good atomic economy. The reaction uses ethanol as a green solvent, with mild reaction conditions and good substrate universality.

         <title>"Collective Total Synthesis of 4&#8208;Azafluorenone Alkaloids"
New title based on the comments of the Reviewers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Azafluorenones are typically obtained by acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;arylnicotinates. However, this approach fails to give 5&#8208;oxygenated 4&#8208;azafluorenones due to lactonization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkoxy)phenylnicotinate intermediates. Herein, we report two modifications of established approaches to 4&#8208;azafluorenone synthesis that, either in combination or by themselves, enable the flexible preparation of 4&#8208;azafluorenones with diverse oxygenation patterns in the benzenoid ring. Undesired lactonization was circumvented via tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)&#8208;mediated radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)pyridines. In the absence of suitable protecting groups for phenolic intermediates, bromide substituents were regioselectively introduced as latent hydroxy groups and later converted under palladium catalysis. We present the first total syntheses of five 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids muniranine, darienine, 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxyonychine, 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetramethoxyonychine, and 6,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxyonychine in addition to new total syntheses of six 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids and one related pyridocoumarin alkaloid.</dc:description>

         <title>Kdo Glycosylations and Their Application in Oligosaccharides Synthesis
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keto&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ulosonic&#8208;acid (Kdo) is widely occurring in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of many pathogenic bacterial cell walls and in some plant root nodules. Kdo&#8208;based glycoconjugates are extensively investigated for vaccine development. In this review, recent advances in Kdo&#8208;glycosides and their use in the synthesis of oligosaccharides are discussed.







Abstract
Higher carbon saccharide 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (Kdo) is a structural unit of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and capsular polysaccharides (CPSs). Kdo is present in the inner core region of LPSs, and this region is structurally conserved. Being non&#8208;mammalian in origin, Kdos are effectively recognized by the native and adaptive immune systems. Therefore, the synthesis of new Kdo derivatives and neoglycoconjugates is highly important for the development of vaccines. This review highlights recent accomplishments related to &#945;&#8208;glycosylations, &#946;&#8208;glycosylations and C&#8208;glycosylations of Kdos and their application to the stereoselective synthesis of inner core oligosaccharides.

A methodology for the formal addition of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anions was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The two&#8208;step reaction, which involves the catalytic addition of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated propargyl anions generated via [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement to electron&#8208;deficient ketones and subsequent alcoholysis, afforded tertiary alcohols having an enone moiety.







Abstract
A methodology for the formal addition of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anions was developed by utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The two&#8208;step reaction involves the catalytic addition of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated propargyl anions generated via [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement to electron&#8208;deficient ketones and subsequent alcoholysis to afford tertiary alcohols having an enone moiety. This is a rare example of a catalytic carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anion equivalents, providing synthetic building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Autocatalytic Green Synthesis of Imines in Traceless Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green and convenient method of aldimines and ketoimines synthesis has been developed. The possibility of further one&#8208;pot modification of imines is shown. The reactions are catalyst free, and no additional purification is needed for the most products.







Abstract
For the first time, condensations of amines with carbonyl compounds have been performed in supercritical carbon dioxide (sc&#8208;CO2). The reactions with aldehydes or active ketones proceed at moderate temperatures (35&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C) without use of external catalysts. The process is autocatalytic: it is accelerated by the carbonic acid generated in&#8197;situ by interaction between the released water and the CO2 medium. The imine products were obtained in high yields in a crystalline form and did not require further purification. The one&#8208;pot transfer hydrogenation and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions performed in the CO2 medium have uncovered attractive prospects for facile green synthesis of more complex and valuable compounds from the generated in&#8197;situ imine products.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;Substituted Pyrazoles from MBH Acetates via Allyl Hydrazone Intermediate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the regioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrazoles by reacting Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman acetates derived from aryl aldehydes with alkyl or aryl hydrazines in the presence of iodine under aerobic conditions. The reaction proceeds via sequential SN2' nucleophilic substitution of substituted hydrazine onto the MBH acetate, I2&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the allylic hydrazine to allylic hydrazone, heating&#8208;induced intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction and cyclization, and oxidative aromatization. The key intermediate, the s&#8208;trans allyl hydrazones were isolated in good yields by performing the reactions at room temperature. However, the allyl hydrazones prepared from the MBH acetates of aliphatic aldehydes did not furnish the pyrazole owing to the absence of an activated methylene group in the substrate. The synthetic applications of the pyrazoles in Ugi reaction, decarboxylative halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyst catalyzed benzoylation of the N&#8208;aryl ring, and metal&#8208;free tetrazole synthesis has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Analogue of LSZ102 as a Highly Potent ER&#8208;&#945; Binder</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and downregulators (SERDs) are used as the first&#8208;line medical treatment for the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors. Herein we report synthesis, ER&#8208;&#945; binding activity, and cytotoxicity of LSZ102 selenium analogues 11 and 28. TR&#8208;FRET competitive ER&#8208;&#945; binding experiments and cytotoxicity assays have shown that the selenium analogues exhibit closely related activity to LSZ102. Furthermore, the prepared selenium analogues are not toxic in rat cardiomyoblasts (H9C2), indicating that substituted benzo[b]selenophene is a prospective scaffold for the development of ER&#8208;&#945; modulators and downregulators for the treatment of ER+ cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine Based Nucleosides: A&#160;Reinvestigation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;based nucleobases have attracted attention in the last years due to their important role in gene regulation. It prompted the development of efficient route to the corresponding nucleoside building blocks for further incorporation into oligonucleotides. Several routes have been employed in recent years to access properly protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;based nucleosides, including hydroxymethylation of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine, radical bromination of thymidine followed by bromide&#160;substitution, or carbonylative coupling through Stille conditions starting from 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine. In this study, we review the different approaches currently used to introduce the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl moiety, we reinvestigate some of them, and finally, we propose an alternative route based on the oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by its reduction that allows access to protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine in a simple way with good yields. Finally, we present some examples of application including the synthesis of base J and 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyuridine.</dc:description>

Several routes have been employed in recent years to access properly protected 5-hydroxymethyl-pyrimidine-based nucleosides, including hydroxymethylation of 2&#8217;-deoxyuridine, radical bromination of thymidine followed by bromide&#160;substitution, or carbonylative coupling through Stille conditions starting from 5-iodo-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine. In this study, we review the different approaches currently used to introduce the 5-hydroxymethyl moiety, we reinvestigate some of them, and finally, we propose an alternative route based on the oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by its reduction that allows access to protected 5-hydroxymethyl-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine in a simple way with good yields. Finally, we present some examples of application including the synthesis of base J and 5-azidomethyl-2-deoxyuridine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated Analogues to the Pentuloses of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxyfluorinated analogues of rare sugars are valuable tools in mechanistic studies on the enzymes involved in their metabolism. Here we describe the first chemical synthesis of 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose, 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose as tools to study the non&#8208;oxidative phase of the pentose&#8208;phosphate&#8208;pathway. Additionally, three potential radiolabeling precursors for future fluorine&#8208;18 radio&#8208;fluorinations were synthesized.







Abstract
Fluorinated carbohydrates are valuable tools for enzymological studies due to their increased metabolic stability compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated analogues. Replacing different hydroxyl groups within the same monosaccharide by fluorine allows to influence a wide range of sugar&#8211;receptor interactions and enzymatic transformations. In the past, this principle was frequently used to study the metabolism of highly abundant carbohydrates, while the metabolic fate of rare sugars is still poorly studied. Rare sugars, however, are key intermediates of many metabolic routes, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here we present the design and purely chemical synthesis of a set of three deoxyfluorinated analogues of the rare sugars d&#8208;xylulose and d&#8208;ribulose: 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (1DFRu), 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (3DFRu) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose (3DFXu). Together with a designed set of potential late&#8208;stage radio&#8208;fluorination precursors, they have the potential to become useful tools for studies on the complex equilibria of the non&#8208;oxidative PPP.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridine and Quinoline Scaffolds Using an Organometallic Li&#8208;, Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208; Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review discusses the various methods for functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Selective deprotonation of aryl or pyridyl/quinolinyl derivatives can be performed using n&#8208;BuLi, LDA, and TMP&#8208;based different organolithium, &#8208;magnesium, and &#8208;zinc reagents. The functionalized pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based heterocyclic compounds were prepared by selectively deprotonating with presenting a directing functional group substituted pyridine/quinoline analogues in the presence of TMP&#8208;bases (TMP&#8208;Li, Mg, Zn reagents). Different aryl or alkyl Li, Mg, and Zn reagents with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents undergo&#160;transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions with pyridine/quinoline halides under mild conditions with the sustainable process producing complex N&#8208;heterocycles. Using moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, sensitive functional group tolerance, and inexpensive and low toxic chemicals, highly functionalization of pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive therapeutic scaffolds and natural products was accomplished. Therefore, in this article, we provide a succinct overview of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods used by various authors between 2010 and 2023 to functionalize pyridine and quinoline analogues using diverse Li, Mg, and Zn organometallic reagents.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenyl&#8208;carbazoles was successfully achieved in a simple and efficient one&#8208;step reaction.







Abstract
The first direct and selective 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;thiolation and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenylation of carbazoles using diaryl disulfides/diselenide as the sulfur/selenium source were demonstrated. This simple, general, and efficient method could deliver a wide range of 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenyl&#8208;carbazoles from readily available starting materials with high regioselectivity in an easily&#8208;operated one&#8208;step reaction via a Ag/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated protocol.

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of CF2H&#8722;Containing S&#8208;Ether Compounds through Isosteric Replacement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of chiral CF2H&#8208; containing quaternary carbon compound was achieved in a mild condition.







Abstract
Optical pharmaceutical important compounds which bring CF2H to mimic the role of &#8211;SH were synthesized through the asymmetric S&#8208;Michael addition reaction in the presence of quinine&#8211;a derived squaramide catalyst. Various sulfhydryl compounds including Benzyl mercaptan, phenthiol, alkyl thiophenol, mercaptoacetate, methyl 3&#8208;mercaptoacrylate, and 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol were tested. The broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and easy derivatization make this synthesis method very attractive.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative [3+2] Cycloaddition for Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Synthesis Using a Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based COF promoted photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline synthesis is reported. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides under aerobic conditions at room temperature.







Abstract
By using a catalytic amount of a porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Ad&#8208;COF) as the efficient recyclable photocatalyst, the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides was developed under aerobic conditions at room temperature. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition and oxidative aromatization cascade process under visible light irradiation. This was the first example to employ the covalent organic framework as the heterogeneous photocatalyst to perform the photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Free Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Iodides in a Bioinspired Deep Eutectic Solvent with Mo(CO)6 as a Safe CO Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy between a nature&#8208;inspired ionic solvent and Mo(CO)6, as a solid source of carbon monoxide, allowed to develop a Pd&#8208;catalyzed amino&#8208; and alkoxycarbonylation under mild reaction conditions and with an improved degree of sustainability.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed amino&#8208; and alkoxycarbonylation of aryl iodides has been exploited, for the first time, in a bioinspired Deep Eutectic Solvent and under gas&#8208;free conditions, by using Mo(CO)6 as the CO source. The method allows for the preparation of carboxylic amides and esters in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%), short reaction time (2&#8197;h) and under mild reaction conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C), with a low catalyst loading (2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Noteworthy, in the case of N&#8208;hexylbenzamide, it has been demonstrated that both the catalyst and DES can be used for four consecutive runs, with a moderate decrease of catalytic efficiency. The methodology has been also applied to the preparation of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient used for the treatment of human scabies and lice.

         <title>Nitraza&#8208;/Oxa&#8208;Propylene&#8208; and Hydrazonemethylene&#8208;Bridged 1,2,4&#8208;Nitraminotriazoles and Selected Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new nitraminotriazoles were synthesized with nitrazapropylene and oxapropylene bridging moieties. Based on those triazoles, as well as the hydrazonemethylene bridged nitraminotriazole, several salts were prepared. By using comprehensive analytical methods and theoretical calculations, their physical and energetic properties were determined and discussed.







Abstract
Two new bridged nitraminotriazoles with bridging oxapropylene and nitrazapropylene moieties were synthesized, and converted into several salts, as well as from the hydrazonemethylene bridged nitraminotriazole. All compounds were fully characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis as well as differential thermal analysis. The sensitivity towards friction and impact were determined according to BAM standard technics and the energetic properties were calculated by using the EXPLO5 computer code. The neutral compounds as well as the various salts were examined in terms of their physicochemical properties and detonation performance to each other and compared to the commonly used secondary explosive RDX.

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on Redox Behavior and Halogen Exchange in Telluropyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluropyran derivative T1 can be reversibly oxidized into halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 (X=Cl, Br, I) with the formation of two Te&#8722;X bonds. The halides in the adducts can be exchanged by lighter ones, but not vice versa. The stabilities of the oxidized products are in the order of T1&#8226;Cl2&gt;T1&#8226;Br2&gt;T1&#8226;I2, which are consistent with the calculated rate constants and energy barriers of the elimination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporation of tellurium into polycyclic compounds may endow them with unique chemical and optoelectronic properties which are not observed in their lighter chalcogen analogues. Herein, a telluropyran&#8208;containing polycyclic compound (T1) synthesized through a ring&#8208;expansion reaction from the corresponding tellurophene analogue can be reversibly oxidized into halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 (X=Cl, Br, I) with the formation of two Te&#8722;X bonds. Their chemical structures have been verified by two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H correlation spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The halogen oxidations of T1 and the reverse thermal eliminations as well as the halogen exchange in halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 have been systematically investigated and compared by UV&#8208;vis absorption titration, electrochemical measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional calculations (DFT). The oxidation of Te(II) in T1 to Te(IV) in T1&#8226;X2 results in the switch from aromaticity to nonaromaticity for the six&#8208;membered telluropyran ring, as revealed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. It is also found that the halides in the halogen adducts can be exchanged by lighter ones, but not vice versa. The stabilities of the oxidized products are in the order of T1&#8226;Cl2&gt;T1&#8226;Br2&gt;T1&#8226;I2, which are consistent with the calculated rate constants and energy barriers of the elimination reactions.

         <title>Triethylamine&#8208;Mediated Transformation of Phosphonates into Phosphonamidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a flexible, straightforward methodology to synthesize phosphonamidates starting from commonly available phosphonates, and demonstrates the use of phosphonylaminium salts to mediate the harsh reactivity of phosphonochloridates. Our methodology is demonstrated on primary amines, secondary amines, ammonium acetate, aniline derivatives and different phosphonate diesters.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds such as phosphonamidates are gaining attention across different fields of chemistry, with interesting applications as pharmaceuticals, or pesticides. However, practical application of phosphonamidates is complicated by their difficult syntheses which often involve expensive or unstraightforward reagents and harsh conditions. To remedy these issues, we present a flexible, room temperature synthesis for novel P&#8208;alkylphosphonamidates without the need for intermediary purification. Commonly available phosphonates are first chlorinated by use of oxalyl chloride and phosphonylaminium salts are used to mediate the harsh reactivity of phosphonochloridates, giving rise to the desired products. We demonstrate the compatibility of our protocol with primary and secondary amines, as well as with different phosphonate esters. The proposed pathway also enables the synthesis of primary phosphonamidates using ammonium acetate as a cheap and safe alternative for ammonia. In future research, this protocol will also enable the synthesis of bioactive targets that are incompatible with current protocols.

         <dc:description>
A new general method for the synthesis of C2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diones is reported, which involves a Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/functionalization and allows for the easy tuning of their photophysical properties.







Abstract
The reactivity of benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation was investigated. Using aryl bromides as aryl source in the presence of carbonate bases in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, the mono&#8208;C2&#8208;arylated benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diones were regioselectively obtained. This procedure allowed to introduce both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl substituents on the benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione unit. These conditions were also effective for the coupling with 1&#8208;bromonaphthalene, 9&#8208;bromophenanthrene as well as aryl bromides bearing synthetically useful nitrile, chloro and methoxy substituents. The photophysical properties of representative arylated compounds have been performed by joint experimental and theoretical studies.

&lt;p&gt;A new general method for the synthesis of C2-aryl-substituted benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene-4,8-diones is reported, which involves a Pd-catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/functionalization and allows for the easy tuning of their photophysical properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene-4,8-dione in Pd-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation was investigated. Using aryl bromides as aryl source in the presence of carbonate bases in 1,4-dioxane, the mono-C2-arylated benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene-4,8-diones were regioselectively obtained. This procedure allowed to introduce both electron-rich and electron-poor aryl substituents on the benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene-4,8-dione unit. These conditions were also effective for the coupling with 1-bromonaphthalene, 9-bromophenanthrene as well as aryl bromides bearing synthetically useful nitrile, chloro and methoxy substituents. The photophysical properties of representative arylated compounds have been performed by joint experimental and theoretical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aryl Crown Ethers Based on&#160;D&#8208;Glucose Scaffold &#8211; Highly Selective Receptors of Amino Acid Ester Hydrochlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acids are important biomolecules with a broad scope of applications in chemical and biological sciences. Their functions and properties depend on their absolute configuration. Therefore, methods for chiral recognition and separation of amino acids are highly sought after. For the purposes of diagnostic and medicinal applications chiral recognition of amino acids in water is particularly relevant. However synthetic receptors for enantioselective binding of amino acids in aqueous media are rare. Recently we reported a d&#8208;glucose&#8208;based crown ether for chiral recognition of amino acid esters in water. We achieved enantioselectivities towards amino acids with hydrophobic sidechains which were among the highest ever reported for a small molecule receptor. The binding affinities were however moderate. Herein we disclose analogs of that receptor, containing aryl functionalities in the crown ether fragment. The new receptors show considerably improved binding affinities for amino acid ester hydrochlorides in water, while retaining high enantio&#8208; or chemoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new group of bases with benzophenoneiminyl (bpi) moiety has been synthesized and characterized in this work. The title compound tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane (P(bpi)3) 1 was prepared with a convenient one&#8208;pot approach: benzophenone imine was deprotonated using MeMgCl and reacted with PBr3 in diglyme. The method could be considered as a method of choice for preparing other (amino)phosphanes in case lithio&#8208;intermediates and/or protonated phosphane is out of consideration. Phosphane 1 is further used to prepare a range of related phosphonium cations and phosphazenes. Phosphonium cations were deprotonated to assess the stability of the resulting phosphonium ylides. In some cases, the bulky substances were capable of forming P&#8208;N heterocycles. Experimental (MeCN) and computational (MeCN, THF, gas&#8208;phase) basicities of benzophenone imine, phosphane 1, phosphonium ylides, and phosphazenes, as well as some representative XRD structures, are presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel oxygen&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride (OCN) material was designed and synthesized via the hydrothermal&#8208;calcination method with melamine and hydroperoxide as starting materials. The OCN material was utilized as a highly efficient solid metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for the synthesis of 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via the catalytic decomposition of aryl diazonium salts under blue light irradiation. Following this approach, various 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields with broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Also, the OCN solid photocatalyst shows good recyclability in the reaction, there was no appreciable loss in yields observed even after 5 cycles. This methodology offers a practical, mild, and metal&#8208;free alternative to the preparation of 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Boc&#8208;Protected &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by 1,3&#8208;Migratory Nitrene C(sp3)&#8722;H Insertion</title>

A straightforward two&#8208;step protocol was developed to convert linear or &#945;&#8208;branched carboxylic acids into non&#8208;racemic N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted (asymmetric catalysis) or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted (enantioconvergent catalysis) &#945;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids are synthesized in two steps from linear or branched carboxylic acid feedstocks. In the first step, the carboxylic acid is coupled with tert&#8208;butyl aminocarbonate (BocNHOH) to generate azanyl ester (acyloxycarbamate) RCO2NHBoc. In the second step, this azanyl ester undergoes a stereocontrolled iron&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;nitrogen migration to generate the N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected non&#8208;racemic &#945;&#8208;amino acid. This straightforward protocol is applicable to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids with aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl side chains. Furthermore, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids are accessible in an enantioconvergent fashion from racemic carboxylic acids. The new method is also advantageous for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino acids. N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids synthesized using this two&#8208;step protocol are ready&#8208;to&#8208;use building blocks.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Enhanced Production and Synthesis of 2,5&#8208; Furandicarboxylic Acid under CO2 Flow through Henkel Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pathways and rate&#8208;determining steps of the preparation of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are identified. The approach includes CO2 flow via the Henkel reaction. The improvements include the mild operating conditions such as atmospheric condition and highest yield among the literatures.







Abstract
The present study investigated the preparation of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via the Henkel reaction between furoic acid alkali metal salts and zinc chloride under a continuous CO2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The results obtained were compared with those of previous studies that used high&#8208;pressure conditions or toxic cadmium catalysts. The pathways and rate&#8208;determining steps of the reaction are revealed for the first time. Furthermore, the enhanced formation of FDCA through the promotion of carboxyl exchange and rearrangement during the reaction under a CO2 flow was examined. The CO2&#8208;rich environment afforded a high FDCA yield of 86.30&#8201;%, which is the highest yield obtained to date using the Henkel reaction. The findings of this study offer economically improved conditions for large&#8208;scale FDCA production.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Photocatalytic Fluoroalkylation of Aromatic Crown Ethers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified crown ethers are fundamental building blocks in supramolecular chemistry, with applications in phase transfer catalysis, metal extraction, smart materials, and molecular machines. Here we report on a one&#8208;pot highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective photocatalytic fluoroalkylation protocol for the mono&#8208;functionalization of benzo substituted crown ethers. For this important class of macrocycles, the method described here represents one of the few late&#8208;stage functionalization procedures that is both high yielding and scalable. Because of its breadth of scope and substrate tolerance, the devised approach can be applied to a wide range of aromatic crown ethers (18 examples, up to 99% yield), including those engaged in mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Nitroimidazole Based PET Tracers: Development of a General Synthetic Approach and Fluorination Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general approach for the synthesis of fluorinated nitroimidazoles is described.







Abstract
2&#8208;Nitroimidazole based PET tracers are widely used for non&#8208;invasive hypoxic tumor diagnosis. In this context, we report here a general method based on a central Mitsunobu reaction to easily access 2&#8208;nitroimidazole precursors. Optimization of fluorination conditions is described and successfully applied to the radiofluorination of the 2&#8208;nitroimidazole precursors. Moreover, the radiosynthesis of a new potential hypoxia PET tracer is also described. Finally, this article presents a SFC analytical method allowing both an easy monitoring of the fluorination reactions and the measurement of partition coefficients (logP).

Abstract
A copper acetate monohydrate catalyzed simple, effective and economic protocol has been developed for the construction of quinazoline derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of easily available 2&#8208;aminoaryl methanols and nitriles. The methodology was also highly effective for the synthesis of medicinally important quinolines analogues. The reactions proceeded in presence of KOtBu in toluene at 110&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;h without the requirement of inert condition, external additives and ligands.

         <title>Reactivity of Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents Bearing Transferable N&#8208;Based Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Hypervalent iodine reagents bearing N&#8208;containing groups have emerged as an alternative to classical electrophilic amination reactions, and are capable of transferring a wide diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to organic molecules. The reactivity of these reagents as well as the mechanism and scope of the reactions are reviewed.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents have the ability of inverting the polarity of functional groups bound to iodine, a reactivity known as umpolung. This reactivity makes hypervalent iodine compounds highly attractive for the creation of electrophilic synthons of known nucleophiles, resulting in novel synthetic disconnections and the formation of new Nu(nucleophile)&#8722;N bond.
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Traditionally, these reagents are limited to few examples. With the use of hypervalent iodine, the transfer of a wide diversity of nitrogen sources became a possibility. This review compiles the latest reported examples of hypervalent iodine reagents capable of electrophilic transfer of nitrogen&#8208;based groups. It showcases the preparation of such reagents, their synthetic utility, and reaction mechanisms involving these group transfer reagents.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Diastereoselective Synthesis of aza&#8208;Spirocyclic P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize diastereoselective spirocyclic amino&#8208;phosphine oxides with a P&#8208;stereogenic center. These potential P*(O), N&#8208;ligands contain both electronic donor and H donor/acceptor properties, which may be used to promote asymmetric catalytic reactions with high selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
Phosphine oxides and spirocyclic compounds are privileged molecules widely employed in a variety of catalytic transformations either as chiral ligands for metals or bifunctional organocatalysts. Herein, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize spirocyclic amino&#8208;phosphine oxides with a P&#8208;stereogenic centre which could serve as potential P*(O), N&#8208;ligands or organocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylselanyl Benzothiophenes through Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of 3&#8208;arylselanyl benzothiophenes was developed. The formation of arylselanyl radicals from diselenides in the presence of visible light enabled the direct synthesis of 3&#8208;arylselanyl benzothiophenes through intramolecular radical cyclization. The reaction does not require any catalysts or additives. This direct method provides a simple preparation route for benzothiophene derivatives, which are important scaffolds in organic synthesis.







Abstract
A novel method for synthesizing 3&#8208;arylselanyl benzothiophenes through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical cyclization was developed. Diaryl selenides were used as aryl selenium sources under the irradiation of white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (5&#8197;W). The reactions were conducted under mild conditions, where the desired products were obtained at room temperature (23&#8201;&#176;C) without the need for catalysts or additives. This simple method allows for an efficient route for synthesizing benzothiophene derivatives, which are crucial scaffolds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Indazole Acetic Acids by N&#8722;N Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the discovery of a novel solvent directed cascade synthesis of biologically relevant indazole acetic acid derivatives is described. Notably, the method is simple, transition&#8208;metal free and provides access to new heterocyclic building&#8208; blocks in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the discovery and development of novel cascade N&#8722;N bond forming reactions for the synthesis of rare indazole acetic acid scaffolds. This approach allows for convenient synthesis of three distinct indazole acetic acid derivatives (unsubstituted, hydroxy, and alkoxy) by heating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;nitroaryl)propanoic acids with an appropriate nucleophile/solvent under basic conditions. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups and electronic effects and, in total, 23&#8197;novel indazole acetic acids were synthesized and characterized. This work offers a valuable strategy for the synthesis of useful scaffolds for drug discovery programs.

         <title>Novel Synthetic Strategy for the Production of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Binders Using 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, biobased binders based on kraft lignin and 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran were prepared and characterized with respect to important properties of conventional binders. By varying the composition of the binders, the influences of the individual components were investigated.







Abstract
In this work, resol based binders were prepared with lignin, resorcinol and the bio&#8208;based aldehydic platform chemicals 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF). In preliminary studies, the solubility and stability of DFF in aqueous&#8208;alkaline conditions was investigated. Various binders were prepared to investigate the influence of the HMF&#8208;DFF ratio and the influence of the aldehyde concentration on the molar mass, rheological properties and curing characteristics of the final binders. It is shown that significantly higher molecular weights and viscosities are obtained by using DFF instead of HMF. The properties of the final binder could also be affected by the precise choice of DFF concentration, as this resulted in higher levels of crosslinking. This work offers a novel type of fully bio&#8208;based binder that consists of non&#8208;toxic components and is therefore less hazardous than some conventional binders.

A direct and regioselective lithiation was realized on N&#8208;Boc&#8208;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazine, simply utilizing the distinct sigma&#8208;acidity on C&#8208;9. Starting from this enabling discovery, C&#8208;glycoside formation, cyanation, and global deprotection steps constitute one of the most efficient syntheses of GS&#8208;441524. Furthermore, transient protection was applied on GS&#8208;441524 with phenyl boronic acid, which facilitated a powerful one&#8208;pot synthesis of remdesivir.

         <title>Facile Multicomponent Synthesis of Oxazolidinones from Primary Amines and Cesium (Hydrogen)Carbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines and dibromoethane is described. It relies on the usage of cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source, furnishing a broad scope with high yields, including the synthesis of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 inhibitor.







Abstract
A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines, dibromoethane (DBE), and the usage of either cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source is reported. The applicability of this technically simple reaction was demonstrated by a broad scope with generally high yields, enabling concise late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino groups into N&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones. The proposed operating reaction mechanism consists of a first&#8208;step nucleophilic substitution reaction between DBE and the primary amine, followed by the formation of a carbamate or carbonate intermediate and subsequent cyclization. Additional versatility of the herein&#8208;developed protocol has been showcased in a medicinal chemistry approach by the generation of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) inhibitor.

It relies on the usage of cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source, furnishing a broad scope with high yields, including the synthesis of an oxazolidinone-modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 inhibitor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile multicomponent, catalyst-free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines, dibromoethane (DBE), and the usage of either cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source is reported. The applicability of this technically simple reaction was demonstrated by a broad scope with generally high yields, enabling concise late-stage functionalization of amino groups into N-substituted oxazolidinones. The proposed operating reaction mechanism consists of a first-step nucleophilic substitution reaction between DBE and the primary amine, followed by the formation of a carbamate or carbonate intermediate and subsequent cyclization. Additional versatility of the herein-developed protocol has been showcased in a medicinal chemistry approach by the generation of an oxazolidinone-modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Al(III) Compounds as Catalysts for the Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyesters and Polycarbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylenediamine bridged dibenzoxazine proligands were synthesized by a modified Mannich condensation reaction. The reaction of the proligands with two equivalents of AlMe3 resulted in the formation of dinuclear Al(III) compounds in high yield and purity. When the ligand binds to the Al(III) center, it forms two separate six membered N,O chelates with the two Al atoms that resembles the N&#8208;alkylated salan moiety. Each aluminum atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry as revealed from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 1. The catalytic activity of these aluminum compounds was investigated towards the ROP of rac&#8208;LA and ROCOP of epoxides (PO, CHO, tBuGE) and phthalic anhydride and ROCOP of CHO with CO2. These aluminum compounds showed notable catalytic activity towards the ROP and ROCOP reactions in the absence of cocatalyst. .</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Cyclic Nitroene&#8208;Sulfonamides from Aliphatic Sulfamides and NOBF4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective desaturation and &#946;&#8208;nitration of cyclic aliphatic amides through a selective HAT/oxidative desaturation/electrophilic nitration process was realized.







Abstract
Described herein is the development of a desaturation and N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitration reaction of cyclic amides, which is achieved by a selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)/oxidative desaturation/electrophilic nitration process. In this procedure, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) acted both as the oxidant and HAT reagent, and electrophilic NOBF4 as nitration source. Notably, the application of produced cyclic nitroene&#8208;sulfonamides was showcased by their efficient transformations into 3&#8208;piperidones and poly&#8208;substituted piperidine derivatives.

         <title>Dihydroazulene&#8208;Boron Subphthalocyanine Conjugates with Oligo(phenyleneethynylene) Bridging Unit: Photoswitchable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroazulene &#8211; Boron subphthalocyanine (DHA&#8208;BsubPc) conjugates were prepared, and the influence of the BsubPc, without or with peripheral fluorine substituents, on the ability of the DHA to photoisomerize into a vinylheptafulvene (VHF) was studied and vice&#8208;versa the influence of the DHA and VHF on the BsubPc fluorescence (on/off).







Abstract
In this work, we have linked the dihydroazulene (DHA)/vinylheptafulvene (VHF) photo&#8208;/thermoswitch and the boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) fluorophore via an axial oligo(phenyleneethynylene) bridging unit into new DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates. The objectives were to elucidate the influence of BsubPc on the DHA/VHF switching reactions and the influence of DHA/VHF on the BsubPc fluorescence in these conjugates for which the entire axial substituent connected to boron comprises one large, conjugated scaffold. We present the synthesis and properties of DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates with varying peripheral substituents on the BsubPc core, being either unsubstituted (H12BsubPc) or partially fluorinated (F6BsubPc). Fluorination of the BsubPc core provided a remarkable increase in the reversibility of the DHA&#8208;VHF interconversions promoted by light and heat, respectively, and accompanied by on/off switching of the BsubPc fluorescence. Synthetically, the units were connected using Sonogashira coupling reactions of suitable acetylenic building blocks.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Bridged Nitropyrazoles &#8211; Adjustment of Performance and Sensitivity Parameters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitropyrazoles are famous powerful energetic materials. Herein we revisited the concept of alkyl&#8208;bridged nitropyrazoles to gain insight into structure&#8208;property relationships. The exchange of explosophoric functional groups and modification of alkyl&#8208;bridge length modifies the properties of the obtained energetic materials. The investigated compounds were synthesized in good yields and characterized exhaustively.







Abstract
Starting from 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;4&#8208;methylaminopyrazole (2), six different energetic salts and three new derivatives of methylene bridged nitropyrazoles were synthesized. The derivatives bear a methylamino (4), methylnitramino (5), and azido group (7). All compounds were intensively characterized using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and DTA/TGA measurements. The sensitivities were determined according to BAM standard methods and the energetic properties calculated using the EXPLO5 code. The energetic salts were compared with each other and with ANTA in terms of their energetic properties. On the basis of the methyl&#8208; and ethyl bridged derivatives, it was shown how the introduction of methylamino (4) and methylnitramino (5) groups in an alkyl&#8208;bridged nitropyrazole system modify its properties (performance &amp; sensitivities). In addition, azido compound 7 was contrasted with its literature&#8208;known constitutional isomer and investigated for its suitability as a potential metal&#8208;free primary explosive.

On the basis of the methyl- and ethyl bridged derivatives, it was shown how the introduction of methylamino (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and methylnitramino (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) groups in an alkyl-bridged nitropyrazole system modify its properties (performance &amp; sensitivities). In addition, azido compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; was contrasted with its literature-known constitutional isomer and investigated for its suitability as a potential metal-free primary explosive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Based on SO2 Surrogates: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have become popular tools for the efficient generation of sulfonyl&#8208;containing molecules. Compared with gaseous SO2, the solid and stable sulfur dioxide surrogates are more convenient to handle. This significantly promotes the development of multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions, and some advances have been achieved in the asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones.







Abstract
Compounds containing sulfonyl&#8208;derived functional groups have received intensive attention owing to their widespread applications in life science, pharmaceuticals and materials science. To access this type of compounds, the multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions relying on sulfur dioxide (SO2) insertion strategy have emerged as novel and attractive approaches in the past decade. The utilization of SO2 surrogates for SO2 insertion in the multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have improved reaction flexibility and step economy. Moreover, some advances have been achieved in the challenging but practical asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones. This review aims to summarize the progress made in the MCRs involving SO2 surrogates from 2019 to 2022, and point out the potentials and challenges in this field.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective peri&#8208; and ortho&#8208;Halogenation of 1&#8208;Naphthaldehydes: Application to the Synthesis of Polycyclic Natural Product Skeletons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective halogenation reaction of 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes was disclosed. When aldehyde was used as directing group, a C8&#8208;selectivity was observed whereas an imine formation was necessary to achieve C2&#8208;halogenation. The mechanism as well as the regioselectivity of the reaction were studied and the halogenated products were used in the synthesis of natural product skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, a regioselective bromination or chlorination reaction of 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. Without additive, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation showed a C8&#8208;regioselectivity, whereas the formation of an aromatic imine intermediate allowed a switch to a C2&#8208;reactivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations were performed to explain the regioselectivity and the synthesized halogenated products were used as key building blocks to access polycyclic natural product skeletons.

         <title>3&#8208;Fluoroalkyl (CF3, CHF2, CH2F) Cyclobutane&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry: Synthesis and Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable and efficient approaches towards the synthesis of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;disubstituted mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoromethylcyclobutane building blocks are disclosed. Effects of the fluoroalkyl substituents and other structural features on their physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and aqueous solubility) are evaluated.







Abstract
Synthesis and physicochemical characterization of all possible cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane&#8208;derived amines and carboxylic acids bearing mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups at the C&#8208;3 position is disclosed. Tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF)&#8208; or morpholinosulfur trifluoride (Morph&#8208;DAST)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of appropriate cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomeric substrates was used as the key step for the preparation of CH2F&#8208; and CHF2&#8208;substituted derivatives. To obtain the corresponding cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric CF3&#8208;substituted derivatives, resolution of known 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (obtained as a mixture of diastereomers) was applied. The proposed procedures were suitable for the preparation of corresponding fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutane&#8208;derived amines and carboxylic acids on up to 50&#8197;g scale. All 12 building blocks obtained were characterized by measuring dissociation constants (pKa) and lipophilicities (LogP, for model derivatives) to evaluate the effect of the fluoroalkyl substituents on their physicochemical properties relevant to further drug discovery applications.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.

         <title>Economical and Environmentally Friendly Organic hydrazone Derivatives Characterized by a Heteroaromatic Core as Potential Hole Transporting Materials in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich hydrazone&#8208;based molecules centred on thiophene or pyrrole &#960;&#8208;bridges have been investigated in their optical and electrochemical properties as potential hole transport material for use in perovskite solar cells. A brief cost analysis has also been carried out to evaluate the sustainability of their synthetic process.







Abstract
A series of organic electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;bridged symmetric hydrazones, composed of two donor moieties connected through a thiophene&#8208; or a pyrrole&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;spacer, has been synthesized as a suitable alternative to 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis[N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino]&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), considered the benchmark hole transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The cheap synthetic protocol is suitable for potential large&#8208;scale production. All the compounds were characterized, showing good energy levels alignments with the perovskite and very close energy levels to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed the electrochemical trend observed. The costs of synthesis were estimated, as well as the produced waste to synthesise the final HTMs, underlining the low impact of these compounds on the environment with the respect to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize alternative to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for industrial development of PSCs.

Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy-to-synthesize alternative to the &lt;b&gt;Spiro-OMeTAD&lt;/b&gt; for industrial development of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mechanistic Perspective on the Mechanochemical Method To Reduce Carbonyl Groups with Stainless Steel and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical reduction of the carbonyl group has been investigated using temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. The design of solvent&#8208;free organic transformation has resulted in increased interest in mechanochemistry, the water&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reduction was conducted in a stainless&#8208;steel vial. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds through a single electron transfer pathway, with iron and nickel as essential components for the reaction.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry through high&#8208;speed ball milling has become an increasingly popular method for performing organic transformations. This newfound interest in high&#8208;speed ball milling is in part driven by the benefit of performing reactions in the absence of solvent. Mechanochemical reactions are often conducted in stainless&#8208;steel vials with stainless&#8208;steel balls. Since stainless steel is made of several readily oxidizable metals (Fe, Cr, and Ni), reduction reactions using water as a hydrogen source were explored using a temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) pathway, with iron and nickel being essential components for the reaction.

         <title>The meta and para OH Substitution Effect on C&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Nitrilimine Bond&#8208;Shift Isomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometric and electronic structure of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, in particular of nitrile imines, can be surprisingly intricate. A particular example is the C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimine, which exists as two energy minima that constitute bond&#8208;shift isomers. Questioning whether substituents in the phenyl ring could affect the existence of such bond&#8208;shift isomers, here we investigate the meta and para OH substituted derivatives. These two nitrile imines were generated in an argon matrix at 15 K by UV&#8208;irradiation of 2H&#8208;tetrazole precursors and found to photoisomerize to carbodiimides via 1H&#8208;diazirines. Using IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations, the C&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist as two bond&#8208;shift isomers, with predominant propargylic and allenic type structures, whereas the C&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist only as one species with a significant allenic type structure. The different effects of the OH substitution in meta and para positions on the bond&#8208;shift isomerism are rationalized with the support of Natural Resonance Theory and Hirshfeld atomic charges. Such fundamental knowledge, on the understanding of how substitution affects the structural characteristics of C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimines, opens the door to modulate the chemistry of this important class of reactive compounds (e.g. in cycloaddition reactions) by appropriate tuning of their substitution (substituent type and position).</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.
