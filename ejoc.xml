         <title>Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid 2 through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid 2 exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, 2 undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound 7. The solid&#8208;state structure of 7, determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals a diamond&#8208;shaped Sn2P2 moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8211;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>DBU&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Cyclization of Sulfoxonium Ylides and o&#8208;Phenylenediamines for Quinoxaline Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method for the synthesis of quinoxalines from o&#8208;phenylenediamines and sulfoxonium ylides, mediated by DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene), is presented. This method does not require metal catalysts or oxidants, making it economical and environmentally friendly, while exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies suggest that DBU facilitates the reaction through nucleophilic attack on sulfoxonium ylides. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and various cross&#8208;reactions further highlight the advantages of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes Enabled by Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a simple and convenient protocol for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using readily available iron salt Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, and phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing material. All reactions proceed efficiently at mild conditions with air as terminal oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, and is distinguished by its simplicity, mild temperatures and broad scope. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80% isolated yield and with 100% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomers with Spirocyclic Acetal units for Synthesis of Sustainable and Recyclable Polymers with Improved Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;functional molecules with spirocyclic acetal structures have recently emerged as attractive monomers to prepare high&#8208;performance polymers, which may subsequently be de&#8208;polymerized and recycled under specific physicochemical conditions. Spirocyclic acetal structures can be formed by condensation of a suitable aldehyde or ketone with a polyol so that the functionalities necessary for the polymerization are retained. In general, rigid spirocyclic acetal units efficiently enhance the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg). This typically increases, e.g., the stiffness and use temperature of the materials. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of spirocyclic acetal units to acidic conditions may be utilized to develop polymers that may be conveniently and selectively cleaved into, e.g., monomers or oligomers under controlled acidic conditions. This opens up opportunities for making new chemically recyclable polymers and plastics. Herein, we highlight the recent progress in molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures and their use for the design and preparation of chemically recyclable high&#8208;Tg polymers. Monomers and polymers with the potential to be derived from sustainable biobased resources are given special attention.</dc:description>

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfurization of Thioamides under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. This contribution described the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides under hydrosilylation, the transformation being driven by blue light irradiation at ambient conditions. Well&#8208;defined Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions to promote selectively the reduction of thioamides furnishing the corresponding amines via the sole cleavage of the C=S bond. (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields)







Abstract
Up to now, there were only few reports on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed reductions of thioamides, one of the explanation of this scarcity being the possible metallic catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of species containing sulfur. In this contribution, we report the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of tertiary thioamides under hydrosilylation conditions at ambient temperature, the reaction being driven by blue light irradiation. To perform selectively the reduction of thioamides leading to amines (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields), highlighting the sole cleavage of the C=S bond, Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Cycloadditions to Prepare Isooxazoline&#8208;Fused Furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component [4+2]/[3+2] sequential cycloadditions of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM), nitrile N&#8208;oxides and furans is developed for the synthesis of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters in good yields and high diastereoselectivity. The method features high reaction orders in the three&#8208;component reaction.







Abstract
A variety of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters were prepared in 40&#8201;%&#8208;87&#8201;% yields with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The control experimental results revealed that the reaction underwent in the order of [4+2] cycloaddition and sequential [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM) generated from 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines, furans, and nitrile N&#8208;oxides generated from hydroxamoyl chlorides. The present method features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high diastereoselectivity of four stereocenters, and novel scaffolds of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines.

         <title>Successors of SmI2: Next Generation Metal, Photo and Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Reductive Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SmI2 is a celebrated reductant to perform numerous challenging reductions and reductive coupling reactions. Nevertheless, stoichiometric nature of SmI2 reactions motivated to develop alternative and more sustainable synthetic methods. Many of these methods are developed on the principle of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET).







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a pivotal role in generating radical intermediates which are pillars of constructing complex molecular structure. Since the introduction by Kagan, SmI2 played a key role in the single electron transfer mediated reductive transformations. Despite significant applications of SmI2 in high profile synthesis of natural products, usage of SmI2 was discoursed due to high molecular weight of reagent, less solubility and most importantly stoichiometric nature of the reactions. Recent years have witnessed a renaissance in photo&#8208;and electro&#8208;catalytic reactions which are more sustainable in nature. A handful of these reactions showed the potential to replace SmI2 as more sustainable and greener alternative. This prospective article aims to demonstrate potential reducing systems to replace the use of SmI2.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands has been rationally designed and scaled up prepared from commercially available NOBIN or H8&#8208;NOBIN. Of which, L1 and Cu(OTf)&#8322; partner effectively catalyzed the cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes, and the desired multifunctional products with untouched arylidene group were obtained in moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96:4er) and diastereoselectivities (up to 95:5dr) with moderate to good yields (up to 83% yield). After simple recrystallization, the diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity of almost all the chiral products may be greatly improved (&gt;99:1er with &gt;99:1dr), which provided a perfect solution for the preparation of highly optical purity of multifunctional &#945;&#8208;arylidene spirocyclopropane succinimides, a potential valuable chiral synthon or chiral platform molecule which may be transformed to diversity of functional chiral molecules by reaction at different functional sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Evaluation of Knoevenagel&#8208;Derived &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation is one of an important reaction that facilitates the formation of olefin linkages (&#8722;C=C&#8722;), and thus has been widely employed to synthesize new &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. This review summarizes the synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds constructed using diketonate/azopyrrole&#8208;BF2 complexes, p&#8208;azaquinodimethane, diketopyrrolopyrrole, and barbituric acid.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic compounds display unique optical and electrical properties, rendering them appropriate for semiconducting applications. Knoevenagel condensation is one of the important reactions that facilitate the formation of olefin linkages (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) and thus has been widely employed to synthesize new &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. This review summarizes the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds constructed using four novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties: diketonate/azopyrrole&#8208;BF2 complexes (BF), p&#8208;azaquinodimethane (AQM), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and barbituric acid (BA), alongside their optoelectronic features and applications in sensing, bioimaging, and photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Nitrosoanilines Using Palladium Acetate and TBHP</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8211;catalyzed highly regioselective ortho&#8211;hydroxylation of N&#8211;nitrosoanilines has been developed, utilizing tert&#8211;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxyl source. The ortho&#8211;hydroxylation reaction proceeds with broad substrates scope to afford high yields of desired products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regiospecific ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines utilizing tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxylating source. The reaction proceeds through N&#8208;nitroso group directed C&#8722;H activation and subsequent hydroxylation at the ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provides a mild, operationally straightforward, and high&#8208;yielding transformation, offering a valuable tool for the construction of ortho&#8208;hydroxylated aniline derivatives, which are important intermediates in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated [4+1] Annulation Strategy for Modular Assembly of Alkynyl/Carboxylated Dihydrobenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed.







Abstract
An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed. Without the need for pre&#8208;dried solvent and inert atmosphere protection, a broad range of substituted propargylamines are well&#8208;tolerated, producing the expected alkynyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans with good to high yields. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and valuable alkenyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans construction were conducted to provide a great potential value in medicinal chemistry and other related disciplines.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed, Thermally Driven [2&#960;+2&#960;]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Olefins and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally&#8208;driven, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions provide a scalable and atom&#8208;efficient strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Complementary to established photochemical methods, they tolerate electronically unbiased substrates, thereby broadening synthetic possibilities for these valuable building blocks and addressing limitations of traditional approaches. The current review summarises the concepts behind this transformation and updates the reader with the most recent advances.







Abstract
The [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of olefins and alkynes stands out as a versatile and atom&#8208;economical strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene building blocks, which are challenging to access through other synthetic methods. While photochemical approaches have traditionally dominated this field, thermally&#8208;driven methods employing transition metals offer distinct advantages, including decreased reliance on pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and improved scalability. This review explores the underlying principles of metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and highlights recent advances in thermally&#8208;driven approaches for the efficient synthesis of cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Particular attention is given to electronically unbiased substrates, which remain a significant challenge for photochemical approaches.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Excited State Switching and Fluoride Responsive Behavior of Orthogonal Spiroborate Ester Derived from Naturally Occurring &#945;&#8208;Mangostin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a sustainable and efficient method for synthesizing a spiroborate ester (MBO) from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), a natural xanthonoid isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit. The synthetic process, structural characterization and photophysical properties of MBO are thoroughly discussed. MBO exhibits an absorption band at 370 nm, with a shoulder around 410&#8208;450 nm in non&#8208;polar solvents, which shifts to 424 nm in polar protic solvents. The compound displays green to blue emission, with intensity decreasing in polar protic environments. These spectral changes result from hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted excited state switching between n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* states, as confirmed by computational studies. MBO also shows excellent anion binding properties, functioning as a dual&#8208;channel probe for both colorimetric and turn&#8208;on fluorescence detection of fluoride ions. This approach not only adds value to the residual mangosteen pericarp by converting it into a fluorescent sensor but also offers a semisynthetic, environmentally benign alternative to conventional organic receptors for fluoride detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioelective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh&#160;catalyst sample named [HRh(PPh3)4] due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh&#160;catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Organic Molecules via Intramolecular Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic compounds or heterocycles constitute the most prominent class of organic chemistry. The extensive functional utility of these compounds in pharmaceuticals and material science has led to increased research interest in this area. Since heteroatom containing molecules hold a pivotal position in both chemistry and biology, a number of methodologies have already been known for their synthesis. However, advancement in the synthetic methodology for their construction under mild reaction conditions is highly important. In the current scenario of research, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in the synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones via direct C&#8208;H functionalization. This one&#8208;pot atom&#8208;economic protocol can construct fused heterocycles that are both pharmaceutically and medicinally important. The present review focuses on transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of heteroatom containing organic molecules intramolecularly through carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) and carbon&#8208;heteroatom (C&#8208;X) bond formation reactions reported over past one decade.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Borrowing Hydrogen/Cyclization Synthesis of Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) with Salen, organic nitrogen hydroxyl groups efficiently catalyze the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of benzimidazoles from nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are an efficient toolbox of access to complex compounds, but the development of multicomponent reactions involved in benzimidazole synthesis is still limited. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction involving nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide was developed for the synthesis of benzimidazoles employing Co&#8208;complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) as catalyst, which by self&#8208;assembly from salen ligands, organic nitrogen hydroxyl compounds, and CoCl2. Compared with previously reported three&#8208;component methods for the construction of benzimidazoles, this method involves a novel hydrogen borrowing/cyclization and can provide a variety of benzimidazole in moderate to excellent yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the evolution of biosynthetic enzymes, the bioactivity&#8208;relevant chemical space of natural products has been significantly expanded. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in elucidating the intriguing chemical and biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds including humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, offering opportunities to discover novel sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.







Abstract
Natural products, with their potent bioactivities and selectivities, significantly benefit human health and agriculture. The evolution of biosynthetic enzymes of natural products has greatly expanded their chemical space relevant to bioactivity. Insights from natural evolution provide valuable guidance for engineering these enzymes to create molecules with novel structures and bioactivities. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds, indicating evolutionary relationships among sesquiterpene scaffolds such as humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, rooted in their biosynthetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of these sesquiterpenoids. These findings illuminate the logic behind the chemical and biosynthetic evolution of sesquiterpenes and offer opportunities to discover new sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.

         <dc:description>Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones are recognized as important tricyclic scaffolds due to their diverse pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;fungi, anti&#8208;tuberculosis, and antimalarial, as well as their roles as 5&#8208;HT3 receptor agonists and kinase inhibitors targeting CK2 and AKT, and others. Developing efficient and reliable synthetic approaches to access these compounds remains an attractive goal in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, particularly focusing on strategies that maintain the A and C&#8208;rings while constructing the B&#8208;ring through the formation of a&#8208;, b&#8208;, and c&#8208;bonds. The information collected describes the two key components of the synthesis process 1&#8208;(2&#8208;substitued&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole and aldehyde or its surrogate.
This review also briefly summarizes the reaction mechanisms for the formation of tricyclic skeletons to determine the key factors governing the issues of productivity and regioselectivity. Through analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing synthetic methods, we predict that A&#8208;ring formation strategy&#8208;based pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline reactions will be developed in the future. We hope that this review will motivate the search for novel strategies to synthesize pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, accessing tricyclic skeletons that may have potential applications in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and many branches of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetrazoles provide a perfect balance between insensitivity and explosive performances and several synthetic routes are available to generate such compounds in high yields. When studying the two&#8208;step synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA), suggested by Shreeve et al., an unexpected intermediate structure was observed. This stable intermediate in aqueous conditions, reacted with hydrochloric acid to generate the desired tetrazole heterocycle suggesting the existence of a scarce organozinc imidoyl azide compound, also coined &#8220;open tetrazole&#8221;. This unusually stable structure is exceptionally isolated as a solid. Furthermore, the possibility of zinc ions coordinating several organic imidoyl azide molecules at the same time, creates a sparse and unprecedented coordination polymer. This new polymeric intermediate is revealed in the synthesis of BTMNA when the starting material, the iminodiacetonitrile (IDA), reacts with sodium azide in water with the assistance of zinc chloride. The intermediate was characterized by Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The observation of such unprecedented intermediates shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and broadens the understanding of the formation and potential use of organic zinc imidoyl azide coordination polymers as insensitive explosives.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here we show that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate (DAP) and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen. The reaction occurs in minutes at 0&#9472;50 oC to convert carboxylic acids to acyl amidophosphate intermediates, which then undergo nitrite&#8208;promoted hydrolysis to give the corresponding acyl phosphates. The partial overlap in scope with important metabolic carboxylates and the concentrated acidic conditions likely limit its direct applicability in metabolic origins of life scenarios. Nonetheless, the work represents a step forward in understanding nonenzymatic carboxylate phosphorylation and helps clarify how the transformation might eventually be rendered compatible with a protometabolism.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward method has been developed for the direct synthesis of unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;aryl compounds from p&#8208;quinone methide (p&#8208;QM) and arylhydrazine. This reaction strategy is executed in air under basic conditions and affords exclusively Z&#8208;isomers in good yields with a broad substrate scope. The stereochemistry of our synthesized azo&#8208;arenes has been confirmed by 2D&#8208;NMR analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer Ligand Facilitated Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions hold a significant position in the field of organic synthetic chemistry as they can rapidly construct structurally diverse molecules with high atom economy. Pincer ligands possess unique structural and electronic properties, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity in multicomponent reactions. This review systematically elaborates on the research progress of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands, thoroughly discussing their mechanism of action in different reaction systems, including crucial aspects such as substrate activation modes, the formation and transformation of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, an in&#8208;depth analysis of the relationship between the structures of various pincer ligands and their reaction performance is carried out, and multiple representative reaction examples are presented, such as multicomponent transformation processes of carbon&#8208;carbon bond and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond formation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8208;pincer complexes or metal&#8208;pincer nanoclusters. Furthermore, the future development of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands are prospected. It is anticipated that they will play a more crucial role in the development of novel organic synthetic methodologies, drug synthesis, and materials science, providing valuable references and inspiration for researchers in related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Sultams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient multigram synthesis of fused sultams (up to 97 g in a single run) via the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sultams was developed. The scope and limitations of the method were studied by evaluating common 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds. The reactions with azomethine ylide (obtained from N&#8208;(methoxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine), nitrile oxides (generated from chloroximes), and nitrones worked well to give the fused heterocyclic building blocks in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. In turn, attempted reactions with allenes, azides, and several other 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds were not fruitful. A series of functional group transformations were applied to obtain fused bicyclic sultam building blocks as promising derivatives for modern drug discovery. In addition to that, antiviral activity was discovered for some representatives of the synthesized bicyclic sultams.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Enaminones in Multi&#8208;component Reactions: A Brief Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As we know, multicomponent reactions have emerged as powerful tools in organic synthesis due to their high atom and step economy, eco&#8208;friendly, diversity, convenience, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and have broad application prospects in many fields such as drug synthesis, material science and natural product synthesis. On the other side, enaminones, which contain amine&#8208;alkene&#8208;carbonyl conjugated structure possessing multiple reactive sites, have extensively served as versatile building blocks for the construction of diverse organic molecules. In this review, we describe recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini&#8208;review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Amino Acid Derivatives through Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent (2019&#8211;2025) advanced strategies in the syntheses of amino acid derivatives through multicomponent reactions, which is organized by grouping four types of catalytic strategies: transition metal catalysis, photoredox catalysis, organocatalysis and multi&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
Amino acids play significant roles in the study of life sciences, pharmaceutical R&amp;D, bioengineering, and so on. Artificial amino acid&#8208;based drugs are important in advancing therapeutic innovation for multiple diseases including chronic pain, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for the construction of complicated structures from readily accessible starting reagents in one pot. Thus, applying multicomponent reactions to the preparation of amino acids and their derivatives can be a potent strategy for advancing the research of pharmaceutical chemistry. With the rapid development of various catalytic methods and multicomponent reactions, this review outlines recent construction methods of amino acid derivatives by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;mediated and other organocatalytic multicomponent reactions.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Regiodivergent Synthesis of Functionalized Maleimides and Itaconimides via in&#8208;situ Generated Pyridinium Ylide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent approach for the synthesis of maleimides and itaconimides using pyridinium ylides. This method ensures broad substrate compatibility and excellent reproducibility.







Abstract
We report a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent synthetic strategy for the construction of functionalized maleimides and itaconimides using in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylides. This approach enables efficient access to both regioisomeric products under mild and straightforward reaction conditions. A variety of pyridinium salts with different aromatic and alkyl groups were successfully used with N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl succinimides demonstrating broad substrate compatibility. The practicality and scalability of this methodology were confirmed through scale&#8208;up experiments, which maintained high yields and reproducibility.

         <title>A New Approach Towards the Synthesis of Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Using &#945;&#8208;Diazoesters and Hydrazide Catalysed by Cu(I) Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy for the preparation of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst is reported. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilising any other metal catalyst, the unexpected imine bond formation between the terminal nitrogen of hydrazide and carbene carbon was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide.







Abstract
Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in pure form and fully characterized them using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Linalool&#8208;Derived Compounds via Catalytic Epoxidation and Ring Opening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the selective epoxidation of linalool using a cobalt&#8208;based catalyst, achieving high yields of linalool epoxide under mild conditions. The methodology was extended to rosewood oil as a raw feedstock, and regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions led to the formation of novel ethers. These results demonstrate the potential of linalool&#8208;derived compounds for fine chemical applications.







Abstract
This study focuses on the selective epoxidation of linalool to produce linalool epoxide, and novel linalool&#8208;derived compounds from this epoxide. A robust and non&#8208;noble cobalt catalyst was employed to achieve high yields of linalool epoxide under mild reaction conditions. The catalytic system displayed remarkable efficiency and reusability, providing a platform for exploring different feedstock, including rosewood oil, to demonstrate its versatility in raw feedstock valorization. Further functionalization of linalool&#8208;derived molecules was achieved through regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions, yielding novel ethers with potential applications in the fine chemical industry. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive approach to the sustainable synthesis of linalool&#8208;derived compounds, displaying the versatility of the catalytic system and providing a basis for the development of fine organic compounds with potential industrial applications.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Synthesis of a Bicyclic Ketocarbaldehyde: Theoretical and Experimental Insights into a Key Intermediate for Some Polycyclic Diterpene Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cyclization of a diketoaldehyde mediated by l&#8208;amino acids produces a (R)&#8208;bicyclic ketocarbaldehyde via a two&#8208;step mechanism involving cyclization and dehydration. Systematic optimization, real&#8208;time monitoring (NMR, MS), X&#8208;ray structural analysis, and computational studies reveal the reaction intermediates, transition states, and factors influencing enantioselectivity and yield.







Abstract
A study on the amino acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of diketoaldehyde 2 to form bicyclic ketocarbaldehyde 1, a potentially useful intermediate in the synthesis of some polycyclic diterpenes, is hereafter presented. This cyclization exhibits a peculiar enantio&#8208;selectivity if compared to similar intramolecular cyclizations due to its product being the (S)&#8208;enantiomer when using d&#8208;amino acids. Our findings reveal that the transformation proceeds through two irreversible steps: the cyclization and the subsequent dehydration process. The reaction enantiomeric excess (e.e.) was optimized by systematically varying the amino acids, solvents, and acids used. Aldol intermediates were successfully isolated. The structure of the most abundant one was confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis, which supported the proposed reaction mechanism. NMR and MS were employed to monitor in real&#8208;time the formation and the evolution of these intermediates. This approach allowed us to detect the key species that contribute to the enantioselectivity and yield of the final product. Additionally, the transition state energies associated with the formation of the eight possible aldol intermediates were examined through computational studies, further elucidating the mechanistic pathway of this enantioselective cyclization.

         <title>Facile Access to Phospholene Fused Polycycles through Intramolecular Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of Phosphole Sulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile and straightforward pathway for construction of phosphorus containing polycyclic compounds through Alder&#8208;ene reaction of the 1,n&#8208;enyne moiety. This work also has demonstrated the advance and feasibility of the alkene cyclization strategy in the synthesis of structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds and naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons.







Abstract
We have developed a simple, metal&#8208;free annulation of phosphole sulfides through intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;enyne component. This atom&#8208;efficient cyclization pathway provides phospholene fused polycycles with high yields and excellent regioselectivity. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization of phosphole sulfides with a phenyl group affords structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds. Meanwhile, phosphole sulfides with a naphthyl group produce naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons, as well as structurally complex [2+2] cycloaddition products.

         <dc:description>
Here, a green synergistic combination of I2, Cs2CO3, and H2O systematically utilised to produce varied flavones and flavanones in a one&#8208;pot manner that includes numerous bioactive compounds along with the natural products naringenin and apigenin.







Abstract
Flavonoids are an important class of naturally existing scaffolds known for their diverse biological activities and have been immensely synthesized using stoichiometric reagent amounts. Herein, we report a reliable, robust, one&#8208;pot, transition metal and additive&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of flavones and flavanones from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and substituted aldehydes. Our developed method utilizes Cs2CO3 as a base and iodine as an oxidant in H2O: DMSO (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvent system, which provides direct access to many flavones and flavanones in excellent yields under milder reaction conditions with simple yet easily available substrates. In application, naturally occurring compounds such as naringenin and apigenin have been successfully synthesized using developed protocol.

The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA) using hydroxylamine with dual reactive centers (O and N) enables efficient N&#8722;O heterocycle synthesis in one step. This study demonstrates a quinidine&#8208;derived squaramide&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade cyclization of N&#8208;benzyl hydroxylamine with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, yielding 1,2&#8208;benzoxazines with up to 99&#8201;% ee, moderate diastereoselectivity, and scalability without enantioselectivity loss.







Abstract
The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA), leveraging the reactivity of two distinct nucleophilic centers (oxygen and nitrogen), has emerged as a transformative strategy in organic synthesis for constructing carbon&#8208;hetero nuclear bonds in a single step. In this work, we report an innovative intermolecular DHMA cascade cyclization reaction catalyzed by a quinidine&#8208;based squaramide catalyst. The use of the squaramide catalyst is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances the electrophilicity of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, thereby promoting excellent enantioselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine. The process demonstrates excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99&#8201;% ee), moderate diastereoselectivity (up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and high yields. The four different 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine stereoisomers have been synthesized with excellent enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, the scaleup reaction of the methodology has been extended with excellent outcomes.

         <title>5&#8208;Substituted 1,2&#8208;Dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;Pyrrolizidines Related to Swainsonine: Synthesis and Inhibition Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile methodology for the synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;pyrrolizidines was developed based on a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination and a late&#8208;stage derivatisation of a common epoxide intermediate accessible in 8 steps from d&#8208;ribose. The synthesised heterocycles were tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi&#8208; and a lysosomal&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;mannosidase.







Abstract
Development of selective Golgi &#945;&#8208;mannosidase II inhibitors possessing a modified swainsonine skeleton has recently become a popular field of study due to their great potential in suppressing metastasis. However, most of the studied modifications involve addition of a substituent on the bicycle which makes the synthesis rather complex as five stereogenic centres have to be generated. Inspired by our previously developed synthesis of (5S)&#8208;5&#8208;benzylswainsonines utilizing a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination, we decided to further investigate the versatility of this strategy by preparing a small collection of simplified analogues bearing only two hydroxy groups, thus eliminating one of the stereogenic centres. This contribution reports a concise synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;pyrrolizidines whose key features include small number of steps, high yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The title compounds were also tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi and a lysosomal &#945;&#8208;mannosidase to assess the effects of the substituents, ring size and missing C8&#8208;hydroxyl on potency and selectivity.

The synthesised heterocycles were tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi- and a lysosomal-type &#945;-mannosidase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of selective Golgi &#945;-mannosidase II inhibitors possessing a modified swainsonine skeleton has recently become a popular field of study due to their great potential in suppressing metastasis. However, most of the studied modifications involve addition of a substituent on the bicycle which makes the synthesis rather complex as five stereogenic centres have to be generated. Inspired by our previously developed synthesis of (5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-5-benzylswainsonines utilizing a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination, we decided to further investigate the versatility of this strategy by preparing a small collection of simplified analogues bearing only two hydroxy groups, thus eliminating one of the stereogenic centres. This contribution reports a concise synthesis of 5-substituted 1,2-dihydroxyindolizidines and -pyrrolizidines whose key features include small number of steps, high yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The title compounds were also tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi and a lysosomal &#945;-mannosidase to assess the effects of the substituents, ring size and missing C8-hydroxyl on potency and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Sulfenylated enaminones are accessible in good to excellent yields by a concise consecutive four&#8208;component alkynylation&#8208;addition&#8208;sulfenylation sequence. Most products are strongly solid&#8208;state luminescent with quantum yields up to 84&#8201;%. In addition, the absorption characteristics of selected products were rationalized via TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Acid chlorides, alkynes, amines, and N&#8208;thiosuccinimides react in a consecutive four&#8208;component alkynylation&#8208;addition&#8208;sulfenylation sequence to give &#945;&#8208;sulfenylated enaminones in good to excellent yields. The terminal sulfenylation step is catalyzed by Yb(OTf)3 and both N&#8208;arylthiosuccinimides and N&#8208;alkylthio succinimides can be successfully employed. Most products are solid&#8208;state luminescent with fluorescence quantum yields up to 84&#8201;% and lifetimes up to 4.9&#8197;ns. Additionally, TD&#8208;DFT calculations rationalize the electronic structure of the absorption characteristics of the dyes.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Sialic Acid&#8208;Derived Tracer for 18F&#8208;PET Multiple Sclerosis Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To contribute to the growing interest in developing selective MS imaging agents, an 18F&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;based PET&#8208;tracer candidate with high affinity towards myelin&#8208;associated glycoprotein (MAG) is disclosed. A multi&#8208;step synthesis of the tracer is disclosed, together preliminary validation of the radio&#8208;labeling process. In vitro studies revealed promising properties that will inform future research.







Abstract
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults, and efforts to understand disease progression continue to be intensively pursued. This is essential in order to reconcile the societal impact of this condition with the conspicuous absence of effective treatment regimes. Whilst magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field, enabling MS to be visualized in patients, distinguishing between other diseases that cause myelin sheath damage is a persistent challenge. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) holds great promise in differentiating neurological diseases, due to highly specific radiopharmaceuticals. To contribute to the growing interest in developing selective MS imaging agents, an 18F&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;based PET&#8208;tracer candidate with high affinity towards myelin&#8208;associated glycoprotein (MAG) is disclosed. Since numerous demyelination patterns are characterized by preferential MAG loss, this target scaffold is attractive in identifying lesion formation. A multi&#8208;step synthesis of the tracer is disclosed, together with preliminary validation of the radio&#8208;labeling process. In vitro experiments revealed promising properties that will inform future research.

The Front Cover depicts the synthesis of novel linalool&#8208;derived compounds with olfactory properties by using simple procedures. A heterogeneous cobalt&#8208;based catalyst enabled the selective, high&#8208;yield formation of linalool/linalyl acetate epoxide, the latter being further transformed into novel compounds. This work demonstrates methodologies to overcome reactivity challenges associated with the hydroxy group in linalool transformations.

         <title>Recent Advances in Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc catalysis. Zinc complexes are experiencing an undoubtable expansion as efficient, affordable and low toxic catalysts in organic synthesis. In addition, taking into the account the high interest of the catalytic synthesis of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, this review compiles the most interesting recent work of the participation of zinc catalysts in this field.







Abstract
Zinc has been an overlooked metal in catalysis for many years. However, this situation has begun to change in the last two decades with a number of contributions demonstrating that zinc salts and complexes are able to catalyze transformations typically accomplished with catalysts based on precious transition metals. The development of such zinc&#8208;catalyzed methodologies is highly appealing because, in general, zinc catalysts are easily available, inexpensive and less toxic. This review aims to present the most recent and relevant examples of the use of zinc catalysts in the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which is a very important process in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Recent Development of DNA&#8208;based Biohybrid Systems Driven by Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 9, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging the fields of photochemistry and DNA&#8208;based materials paved the way for unprecedented reactivities and applications. This review focuses on recent developments around the design of biohybrid DNA&#8208;based nanosystems driven by light with a particular emphasis on cross&#8208;linking and ligation reactions, programmable photo&#8208;release and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries.







Abstract
Photochemistry has provided a powerful alternative to generate reactive intermediates under mild reaction conditions and photobiocatalysis is currently widely applied in organic synthesis. While enzyme&#8208;based photocatalysis has attracted a lot of attention, light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems are also increasingly being applied to a large variety of applications from molecular imaging to enantioselective catalysis, and other fields such as DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). This review gives insights into these research fields by classifying the existing light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems developed to date.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Analysis of Published Br&#248;nsted Plots Supports Br&#248;nsted's &#8220;Conventional&#8221; pKa Values: 14.00&#8201;for Water and 0.00&#8201;for H+(aq)</title>

A representative linear Br&#248;nsted plot for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Percentages given here are drawn from 34 plots of H2O values and 12 plots of H+ values.







Abstract
In the early 1900s, Br&#248;nsted used two different pairs of pKa values for water and the aqueous proton: He denoted 14.00 and 0.00 (respectively) as the &#8220;conventional&#8221; values, and 15.74 and &#8722;1.74 (respectively) as the &#8220;rational&#8221; values. Although the conventional values have been supported by both experiment and theory, the rational values have been employed in the vast majority of studies involving Br&#248;nsted plots up to the present day. Here we present a meta&#8208;analysis of 67 Br&#248;nsted plots published from 1924 to 2010, revealing that rational pKa&#8217; values more frequently appear as statistical outliers (a greater than 80&#8201;% rejection rate) compared to conventional values (a roughly 50&#8201;% rejection rate) based on Q&#8208;tests. Furthermore, in 85&#8201;% of examined plots, the conventional points align more closely with best&#8208;fit lines. An evaluation of Hupe and Pohl's Marcus plots also shows a somewhat better fit with the conventional rather than the rational pKa&#8217; values. Finally, in the bond length versus pKa investigations published by Brydon et&#8197;al., all the rational points were statistically rejected, whereas the conventional values were accepted. From our statistical analyses, we conclude that a convincing majority of experimental evidence from published Br&#248;nsted plots leads one to question the validity of Br&#248;nsted's rational pKa&#8217; values for water and the aqueous proton (15.74 and &#8722;1.74, respectively).

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclooctynes as Building Blocks for Non&#8208;covalent Surface&#8208;Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) have been synthesized. The 8&#8208;membered ring was derived from cyclooctadiene, by Beckmann rearrangement or by ring&#8208;closing metathesis.

         <title>Multi&#8208;component Domino Strategy for Regioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A sustainable one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component domino strategy for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones has been developed using inexpensive, stable, and recyclable silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid as the heterogeneous catalyst under solvent&#8208;free conditions. This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones up to a 93% yield via annulation of &#946;&#8208;oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Diving into the Shielding Surfaces: Construction of Atropisomeric Axes via Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction, characterized by a CH group acting as a hydrogen bond donor and &#960; electrons serving as the acceptor, shares structural similarities with hydrogen bond and plays a significant role in a multitude of molecular systems. However, due to the weak and variable nature of these interactions, they remain poorly understood. Recently, we reported the design of high rotational barrier atropisomeric systems incorporating CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Building on these insights, we explored the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) to access additional atropisomeric systems. We hypothesized that the GBB&#8208;derived scaffold could serve as a modular platform, facilitating the strategic incorporation of CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions to enhance structural diversity and functionality. Using 2&#8208;aminopyridine, polyaromatic aldehydes and ortho&#8208;substituted phenyl isocyanides, we systematically explored the substrate scope. We investigated the impact of different shelves and arms, emphasizing the effect of aromatic ring topology and number on molecular conformations and ring currents. To analyze experimental NMR signals of methyl groups, we calculated the chemical shifts and estimated the ring current contributions. The through&#8208;space NMR shielding calculations and isochemical shielding surface (ICSS) visualizations provided insights into the electronic environments within the scaffold, advancing our understanding of CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination protocol using NBS under visible light in standard laboratory glassware is described. The monobromination reaction is efficient and selective over a wide range of substrates. Unlike previous studies, we prove that the use of a photocatalyst is unnecessary. The proposed protocol is simple to implement and applicable at the gram scale. The reaction takes place in a few tens of minutes at room temperature and offers an alternative to the use of CCl4, which is conventionally used for Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination. Alternative conditions of bromination by CBr4 in the presence of a photocatalyst have also been investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Oligothiophenes via Subtle Changes in Donnor &#8208; Acceptor Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligothiophenes varying by their donor&#8208;acceptor sequences and displaying distinct optical and electrochemical properties were synthesized by playing with the different reactivity of &#945; and &#945;&#8217; positions of 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis and electronic properties of oligothiophenes derived from the 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene building block. By exploiting the differential reactivity of thiophene's &#945;&#8208;positions, regioisomeric derivatives were synthesized with varying donor&#8211;acceptor sequences. These derivatives displayed distinct optical and electrochemical characteristics based on the relative positions of cyano acceptor and hexyloxy donor groups. Spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical analyses revealed that substituent placement critically affects electronic properties, such as HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and band gaps. The introduction of alkoxy groups at external &#946;&#8208;sites promoted coupling reactions upon oxidation, leading to polymerization or dimerization. Conversely, cyano groups at these positions stabilized radical cations and dications, suppressing further reactions. These findings offer insights into designing conjugated systems with tunable properties, emphasizing the importance of substituent positioning for optimizing performance.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Alkyne&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition to Access Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was introduced for constructing chiral biaryls using Cu catalytic system facilitated by chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridged box ligand, using dialkynyl diaryls and azides as raw materials. This protocol offers notable advantages: simple operation, mild condition, good functional group tolerance, high yields, and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls are an important class of structural units widely used in natural product synthesis, drug design, and as ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Although significant progress has been made in the synthesis of axially chiral biaryls, some of them are still limited to narrow substrate ranges, low efficiency, and moderate stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a highly efficient route to prepare atropisomeric biaryls with triazole and alkyne modules through the desymmetrization of prochiral dialkynyl diaryls utilizing chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridge box ligands in conjunction with copper salts. The process has mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can obtain a wide array of valuable axially chiral biaryl derivatives with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed deuterodichloromethylation of olefins was developed to afford deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes in good yields. Readily accessible silacarboxylic acids were employed as halogen&#8208;atom transfer reagents and deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced deuterodichloromethylation of alkenes was developed with readily available and inexpensive deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent. Silacarboxylic acids, which could generate silyl radicals through efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation, were applied as halogen atom transfer agents. A series of deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Photocarboxylation of Arylated 2H&#8208;Azirines Exploiting Continuous Flow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous process for the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles is reported which links the photochemical opening of azirines and the subsequent trapping of the azomethine ylides with CO2 gas. This highlights challenges and solutions when incorporating CO2 as a feedstock material for the photochemical synthesis of small heterocyclic building blocks.







Abstract
A robust and efficient continuous flow set&#8208;up is presented for the orchestrated use of CO2 gas and photochemistry in flow mode. This study explores the catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition between azomethine ylides generated in&#8197;situ from simple 2H&#8208;azirines and CO2. Using UV&#8722;A light (365&#8197;nm) as energy source and CO2 as inexpensive and abundant building block provides an attractive strategy affording isomeric oxazolones which were subsequently aromatised to yield novel oxazole products in a convergent manner. Continuous flow processing substantially improves the reaction performance allowing for the safe exploitation of this intriguing transformation. This enables the effective fixation of CO2 to generate valuable building blocks that can be scaled to gram scale with ease.

         <title>Stereoselective Strategies for the Synthesis of Functionalized Cis&#8208;Hydrindanes in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cis&#8208;hydrindanes have attracted significant interest in the scientific community due to their prevalence in natural products and relevance in medicinal chemistry. This review discusses various synthetic strategies developed since 2000 for constructing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes, with a focus on their application in natural product synthesis and highlighting their importance in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The cis&#8208;hydrindane motif is a bicyclic structure commonly found in many natural products that exhibit significant biological activity. This structural feature is present in a variety of bioactive compounds, particularly terpenoids, steroids, and alkaloids, which are known for their therapeutic potential, including anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Due to its prevalence and biological relevance, the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework has attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists, who have devoted substantial effort toward developing efficient and diverse methods for constructing this important motif. Many of the synthesized cis&#8208;hydrindane compounds have been used as key intermediates or building blocks in the total synthesis of complex natural products. This review provides an overview of strategic approaches for synthesizing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes and its derivatives from 2000 to the present day, focusing on their application in natural product synthesis. By examining the diverse methods and their impact on natural product synthesis, this review will underscore the enduring importance of the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework in both synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (4H)&#8208;Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids, and their Antioxidant Activities using Electron Transfer Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine as potent antioxidants. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC.







Abstract
A novel series of (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones, designated as compounds 5(a&#8211;l), were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent as both catalyst and solvent. Amide intermediates were first produced via the Schotten&#8208;Baumann reaction. These intermediates then underwent cyclization in the presence of PCl3 and deep&#8208;eutectic solvent, leading to the formation of imidazolones as potent antioxidants. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC. Among the tested compounds, compound 5&#8201;i exhibited excellent antioxidant activity compared to the standard reference drugs, ascorbic acid and Trolox.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivations of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;C Glycoside Rearrangement through Time&#8208;Controlled Electrochemical Flow Strategy: Switching between Kinetics and Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report time&#8208;controlled O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement in flow&#8208;electrochemical microreactors, focusing on kinetic and thermodynamic selectivity. The selective synthesis of phenolic O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides has been explored using O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement. We investigated the time&#8208;control of O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement using a flow microreactor, which allows for second&#8208;scale reaction control. The electrochemical approach demonstrated that shortening the residence time leads to the selective synthesis of O&#8208;glycosides, while longer times favor the formation of C&#8208;glycosides. Kinetic studies revealed that substituents on the phenol ring affect the rate of O&#8208;glycoside formation and its rearrangement to C&#8208;glycosides. Finally, continuous flow synthesis was demonstrated, showcasing the scalability and utility of this method for producing bioactive substances.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Driven Organophosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Iododifluoroalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalyzed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed, eliminating the need for additional metal catalysts and bases. This protocol enables the efficient and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides under mild conditions, demonstrating excellent tolerance to iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytic phosphine functions not only as a Lewis base, forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex with difluoroalkyl iodides through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions to generate Rf radicals, but also as a halogen transfer shuttle catalyst to facilitate the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pillararene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry on the Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes showed significant impact on the asymmetric synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acids, not only altering the reactivity of the substrates but also changing the enantiomeric excess of the products. This impact was influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the type of catalyst, the kind of pillararene, and especially, the structure of the aldehyde.







Abstract
To clarify the relationship between the host&#8208;guest complexation and enantioselectivity of an asymmetric reaction, we studied the impacts of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest chemistry on the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones from aldehydes, where the aldehydes meanwhile acted as guests. The addition of different pillar[5]arenes cannot only adjust the reactivity of the substrates but also change the enantiomeric excess of the products. The magnitude of such impacts is influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the catalyst, the usage and kind of pillararenes, and the structure of aldehydes. When the pillararene&#8208;substrate interactions are strong in the reaction systems, the ee variations of products are mainly decided by the guests, aldehydes, whereas the reaction activities are mainly affected by the hosts, pillar[5]arenes.

         <title>Strategies for Modification of Tryptophan Residues: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives in Photo&#8208;/ Electrochemical&#8208;Induction, and Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in photo&#8208;induced, electro&#8208;induced and metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications of tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides, among others. The advantages of photoinduction and metal catalysis and their benefits in the development of tryptophan and its tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and their applicability in the development of novel biocompatible methods are discussed. In addition, the current limitations of these methods and the future challenges that need to be addressed are explored.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid distinguished by its unique indole ring, making it an ideal target for chemical modification. Recent advancements in modification strategies, including photo&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;induced, and metal&#8208;catalyzed techniques, have significantly enhanced the efficiency and selectivity of Trp modifications, expanding its applications across drug development, materials science, and environmental monitoring. Photochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which utilize light energy to drive reactions under mild conditions, offer a green and efficient method for Trp transformation. This approach often improves Trp's optical properties, such as fluorescence, thereby enhancing its utility in bioimaging and sensor applications. Light&#8208;driven modifications also allow the introduction of functional groups, yielding bioactive derivatives with potential therapeutic benefits. Electrochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which leverage electric energy to precisely regulate oxidation and reduction processes, enable selective Trp modifications through fine&#8208;tuning of applied potential. This method supports the targeted addition of functional groups like hydroxyl or amino groups, essential for synthesizing Trp derivatives aimed at modulating protein activity and developing new therapeutic agents. Both photo&#8208; and electrochemical methods generate radical intermediates via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET), aligning well with Trp's redox&#8208;active nature. These methods also offer mild and controllable conditions that address chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity challenges inherent in traditional bioconjugation strategies. The promising advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis underscore the appeal of novel Trp&#8208;based bioconjugation methods. In addition, metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations using transition metals such as palladium or copper allow for complex modifications, including C&#8722;H activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which enable site&#8208;selective alterations within the Trp molecule. These metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications yield derivatives with enhanced chemical, optical, or biological properties, suitable for applications in optoelectronics, biosensors, and medicinal chemistry. Collectively, these advancements in Trp modification elevate its utility across diverse scientific disciplines, providing a versatile platform for creating novel compounds with superior chemical, biological, and optical characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the latest advancements in Trp modification, with an emphasis on their transformative impact across various fields.

&lt;p&gt;A series of &#946;-hydroxyselenides from reactive N-homoallyl(hetero)arylamines and O-homoallyl(hetero)arylethers were effectively synthesized with high to excellent yields under electrolysis. The profiles of mild conditions, simple operation, short time, free of oxidants and transition metals, and good compatibilities of substrates render this methodology greener and potentially synthetic value in producing application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Mixed Docosahexaenoic Acid Phosphatidylcholine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis method is proposed for the production of mixed DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) phosphatidylcholines, allowing access to both regioisomers with DHA positioned at either the sn1 or sn2 site. Regioisomers of acetate derivatives (AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC, stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA) and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs (antioxidant drugs) were synthesized to investigate how the positional distribution of DHA within PCs influences brain and retinal uptake.







Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22&#8201;:&#8201;6 n&#8208;3) is a critical omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with essential roles in brain and retinal functions. Its selective uptake into these tissues is mediated by several pathways, including the transporter Mfsd2a, which preferentially utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine&#8208;DHA (LPC&#8208;DHA) as a substrate. Due to the low de novo synthesis of DHA, optimizing its dietary intake and exploring novel delivery strategies are important in pathologies that affect PUFA proportion. The present work focuses on developing an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic methodology to access structured mixed DHA phosphatidylcholines (mixed DHA&#8208;PCs), valuable biological tools for enhancing drug and/or DHA delivery to the brain and retina. Chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods were established to synthesize mixed sn1&#8208; or sn2&#8208;DHA&#8208;PC isomers, to study the importance of DHA position, from cost&#8208;effective glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC). The approach aligns with green chemistry principles by leveraging lipase&#8208;catalyzed regioselective acylation and deacylation reactions, thus reducing the number of chemical steps compared to traditional methods. The resulting mixed PCs AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC (stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA), and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs were produced at a scale suitable for future in&#8197;vivo studies, enabling investigations into the positional effect of DHA on brain and retinal uptake.

         <title>Mechanochemical Dissociation of Singlet Carbene&#8211;CS2 Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical release of carbon disulfide (CS2) from singlet carbene&#8211;CS&#8322; adducts is explored. While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC) adducts exhibit complete conversion, cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) adduct undergoes decomposition. DFT calculations reveal how electronic structure influences CS2 release, offering insights into the reactivity of singlet carbenes&#8211;small molecule adducts.







Abstract
Owing to the extensive application of singlet carbenes, their generation through the release of small molecules from stable adducts is attracting increasing research interest. This study explores the mechanochemical release of CS2 from Carbene&#8211;CS2 adducts formed by three distinct singlet carbenes: cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC); N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC); and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC). Under ball&#8208;milling conditions, these adducts exhibit notably different reactivities; DAC&#8211;CS2 releases CS2 completely within 20&#8197;min, NHC&#8211;CS2 has a slower release rate, while CAAC&#8211;CS2 decomposes into a complex mixture. DFT calculations reveal that the release of CS2 from CAAC&#8211;CS2 requires the highest activation energy (32&#8197;kcal/mol), suggesting that it is inaccessible under the reaction conditions. This is likely because of the higher HOMO energy of CAAC, which correlates with a stronger bond with CS2, thereby limiting its dissociation. This study highlights how the electronic structures of carbenes influence their interactions with small molecules, paving the way for controlling the reactivity of carbene&#8211;small&#8208;molecule adducts.

Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols to afford &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyl ketone derivatives. The key of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes and the generation of unprecedented sulfoxonium ylide radical upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols is reported. The core of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes. Upon photo&#8208;activation, IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides in&#8208;situ generates sulfoxonium ylide radical, which is trapped by thiophenes to generate &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;ketyl sulfoxonium ylides and initiated subsequent carbenic O&#8722;H insertion from alcohol component. All reactions are operationally simple and proceed smoothly under mild reaction conditions, affording a broad range of unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization for Efficient Synthesis of Quinazolinones from Indoles and Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid/DMSO, and aliphatic amines to obtain valuable quinazolinone derivatives has been described. This strategy demonstrates mild reaction conditions, high efficiency, and excellent tolerance of functional groups. The applicability of the synthetic reaction was validated by synthesis of rutaecarpine and large&#8208;scale efficient synthesis of quinazolinones.







Abstract
In this study, we report an iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid or DMSO, and aliphatic amines to synthesize quinazolinone derivatives via oxygenation cleavage of the C=C double bonds of indoles. This method features mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent functional group tolerance. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated through its application in synthesizing rutaecarpine and a scalable protocol for efficient quinazolinone production.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we report an iodine-catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid or DMSO, and aliphatic amines to synthesize quinazolinone derivatives via oxygenation cleavage of the C=C double bonds of indoles. This method features mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent functional group tolerance. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated through its application in synthesizing rutaecarpine and a scalable protocol for efficient quinazolinone production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step procedure utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water was disclosed. Conceptually, this novel approach involves an initial Pd(0)/TPPMS&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of the benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines.







Abstract
We report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction/aromatization cascade utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water. Conceptually, this novel one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step approach involves an initial Pd(0)/sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene&#8208;3&#8208;sulfonate (TPPMS)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines. The &#960;&#8208;benzylPd&#8197;(II) catalytic system generated in&#8197;situ from Pd(0)/TPPMS and benzylic alcohols was found to be highly effective for alcohol dehydrogenation in water.

         <title>Investigations into Intramolecular Cerium&#8208; and Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Styryl Moieties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese catalysis affords oxidative radical cyclizations of &#947;&#8208;allyl &#946;&#8208;oxoesters in an atmosphere of air. The mediately formed peroxides are either reduced with zinc&#8211;acetic acid to yield tricylic lactones as final products. Alternatively, the peroxides are treated with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine to furnish bicyclic scaffolds with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl substructure in a subsequent Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation.







Abstract
Bicyclic diketones and lactones are obtained in up to 60&#8201;% yield in the aerobic, manganese&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular radical cyclization of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a six&#8208;membered ring and phenyl or diphenyl allyl substituents in the &#947;&#8208;position. Intermediate products of this transformation are peroxides, which are processed either reductively with zinc&#8211;acetic acid or by Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation (with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine). The respective congeners with five&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings either undergo only &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation reactions or mixtures of various cyclization products are obtained in low yields. In this study, also cerium&#8208;catalysis was investigated, however, the yields are lower compared to manganese catalysis. The relative configurations of all racemic products were established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analyses.

While synthesizing a tetra&#8208;substituted perylene, we also made a hexa&#8208;substituted perylene dimer for the first time. It'll be a new way to create dimers bonding less reactive positions, making good use of the side reaction of cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
One&#8208;step Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 2,5,8,11&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated perylene with 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)bromo&#8208;benzene gave 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked perylene dimer for the first time in 7.3&#8201;% yield under the standard conditions. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure exhibits three independent dimers in the unit cell, reflecting the low rotational energy around 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linkage. Excited state properties of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimer were compared with the corresponding 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked congener. The facile synthetic method developed in this study could be a general route to access polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oligomers linked at less reactive positions.

The enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the asymmetric construction of acyclic 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon has been established, which involves an enantioselective addition reaction and a subsequent chelate&#8208;controlled diastereoselective alkylation reaction. Specifically, the enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.

This manuscript describes a surfactant&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones with indoles in water, mediated by dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. The process involves sequential nucleophilic additions of indoles to the aldehyde group, followed by Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization and dehydrative aromatization, affording indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles in good yields under mild conditions with broad substrate compatibility.







Abstract
The surfactant&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones with indoles was investigated in an aqueous medium for the synthesis of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles. The reaction was carried out in the presence of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, which was initiated by two consecutive nucleophilic additions of indoles to the aldehyde group of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones, followed by a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and dehydrative aromatization. This protocol afforded the desired products in good yields under mild conditions and demonstrated a broad substrate scope.

The reaction was carried out in the presence of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, which was initiated by two consecutive nucleophilic additions of indoles to the aldehyde group of ortho-formylarylketones, followed by a Friedel&#8211;Crafts-type cyclization and dehydrative aromatization. This protocol afforded the desired products in good yields under mild conditions and demonstrated a broad substrate scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;Guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From radical initiation to dimer formation, the radical coupling reaction profile of Juncus acutus phenanthrenoids is mapped through a two&#8208;state mechanism, involving a triplet intermediate. This study offers crucial insights into the dimerization process, using computational methods to uncover molecular mechanisms and highlight the role of water in facilitating keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, advancing our understanding of biosynthesis in plants.







Abstract
Juncus acutus is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and in solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.

         <title>On the Synthesis of [1,3]Azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)lines and 2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides</title>

Syntheses of quinoline and quinoxaline derivatives fused with phosphacycles were developed from commercially available quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine.







Abstract
Despite their potential in areas such as medicinal chemistry and organic materials, scaffolds in which quinoline and quinoxaline are fused to phosphacycles such as 1,3&#8208;oxaphosphole, 1,3&#8208;azaphosphole, P&#8208;arylated and P&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;azaphosphole P&#8208;oxides have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this study we have developed a synthetic approach to [1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines from quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine. These were converted to 5&#8208;phosphanylquino(xa)lin&#8208;6&#8208;amines by regioselective iodination in position 5, cross&#8208;coupling with diethyl phosphite and reduction. Formation of the azaphosphole ring was then achieved by reaction with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. Attempts at C&#8722;H arylation in position 2 did not lead to the desired derivatives but rather to 1&#8208;arylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides. Access to 1&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinoline 1&#8208;oxides was also developed using as key steps cross&#8208;coupling with ethyl phosphinate formed in&#8197;situ and the subsequent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction. The resulting tricyclic compounds were finally tested against a panel of disease&#8208;related protein kinases.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene towards Dichalcogenide Bonds, IPr Carbene, 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylphenyl Isocyanide and Trimethylsilyl Azide</title>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene 1 towards small molecules was investigated, yielding a handful of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives.







Abstract
The development of phosphinidene precursors capable of releasing free phosphinidenes holds great potential in exploiting their reactivity with small molecules and enthalpically strong bonds. We report the facile cleavage of dichalcogenide bonds, including S&#8722;S, Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonded complexes over the phosphorus center of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (1), which produces a variety of phosphonodichalcogenides (2&#8208;4). We also show the ambiphilic nature of 1. The reaction of 1 with nucleophiles, such as 1,3&#8208;bis(isopropyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IiPr) and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl isocyanide (DipNC) gives a phosphinidene adduct of IiPr and a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;3&#8208;azaallene, respectively. Treatment of 1 with trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) affords an iminophosphanide, manifesting the nucleophilic nature of 1. These compounds were fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and spectroscopic analysis.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Alkyl enol Ether Synthesis via Microwave&#8208;Promoted, Base&#8208;Catalysed Alkyne Hydroalkoxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the synthesis of alkyl enol ethers was developed, based upon microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation, requiring only alkyne and alcohol components and mild base catalysis. The reaction displayed broad substrate tolerance and was highly selective for Z&#8208;configured, anti&#8208;Markovnikov enol ether products.







Abstract
The diverse reactivity presented by alkyl enol ethers underpins a wide range of synthetically significant processes. Their synthesis is often achieved by atom&#8208;economical alkyne hydroalkoxylation (i.&#8201;e., addition of an alcohol across an alkyne), either using superbasic conditions or transition metal catalysis.

     alt="Regio- and Stereoselective Alkyl enol Ether Synthesis via Microwave-Promoted, Base-Catalysed Alkyne Hydroalkoxylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward method for the synthesis of alkyl enol ethers was developed, based upon microwave-promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation, requiring only alkyne and alcohol components and mild base catalysis. The reaction displayed broad substrate tolerance and was highly selective for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-configured, anti-Markovnikov enol ether products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse reactivity presented by alkyl enol ethers underpins a wide range of synthetically significant processes. Their synthesis is often achieved by atom-economical alkyne hydroalkoxylation (&lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;., addition of an alcohol across an alkyne), either using superbasic conditions or transition metal catalysis. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions of the former approach limit substrate tolerance whilst the latter approach often requires inert, anhydrous conditions and exotic, expensive catalysts. In order to pursue more convenient, general and sustainable methodology for enol ether synthesis, we have developed microwave-promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation as an attractive solution. Our optimised conditions employ caesium carbonate as a mild base catalyst and the required alcohol as solvent and reagent, with reaction temperatures from 20&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C and reaction times from 10&#8211;60 minutes. We have demonstrated that the reaction shows broad tolerance of diverse substrate functionality (&lt;i&gt;e.&#8201;g&lt;/i&gt;., ester, ether, carboxylate, nitrile, nitro, halide), including examples of terminal, internal, aryl and alkyl alkynes. Greatest reactivity is observed with electron-poor alkyne substrates, and the reaction shows near-complete &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov regioselectivity and a very strong stereochemical bias towards &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-configured enol ether products. These observations are consistent with a polar mechanism proceeding via a vinyl anion intermediate, and we provide empirical and computation evidence in support of this.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Investigation on the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;Silylboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically examined. The overall reaction profile was proposed, and the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization was found to take place through an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity was determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect.







Abstract
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.

Abstract
A refresh and improvement of the well&#8208;known myo&#8208;inositol chemistry is reported here, setting up a new synthetic protocol to obtain orthogonally protected compounds, with a special focus on the preparation of 2&#8208;O&#8208;alkylated compounds. A gram scale synthesis of the 2&#8208;allyl compound was performed and optimized in terms of yield. This intermediate is the precursor of chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose, for which synthetic procedures are lacking. Taking advantage of the easily handled allyl group, we were able to transform this keto compound into both the 1,2&#8208;diketone and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;diketone, intermediates of biological transformations used in several patented applications. Finally, to access poly&#8208;hydroxylated&#8208;(aminomethyl)cyclohexane compounds, the reaction of the keto compound with cyanide was optimized, affording cyanohydrins obtained as single stereoisomer, the precursor of the above compound.

Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have drawn great attention due to their various significant advantages including highly efficient, environment&#8208;friendly, and atom&#8208;economic. Developing more efficient and selective MCRs is of great significance to construct chemical libraries of potential functional compounds. On the other hand, supramolecular containers have been successfully applied as novel nanoreactors to mediate diverse organic transformations, and MCRs are included. In this review, examples of supramolecular container mediated MCRs have been summarized. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+).

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence Solvatochromism of Push&#8208;Pull Type Indenoindene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO demonstrated the effectiveness of structurally rigid planar COPV platform for full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism. Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 achieved a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) &#8805;0.90 in aprotic solvents, with a 0.74&#8197;eV shift between cyclohexane and methanol. [Ph&#8322;N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]&#8322;CO demonstrated lower PLQY but enhanced sensitivity to water content and extinction coefficient of up to 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism was demonstrated using two carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO with a push&#8211;pull system, where the donor and acceptor moieties are diphenylamino and a carbonyl group, respectively. In non&#8208;polar cyclohexane, the molecules exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#955;PL=443 and 464&#8197;nm) with a locally excited character, while in polar solvents, a charge&#8208;transfer character emerged. In methanol, red emission was observed (&#955;PL=602 and 572&#8197;nm). The difference in luminescence maxima between cyclohexane and methanol corresponds to 0.74 and 0.59&#8197;eV for Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO, respectively, which are larger than those of previously reported push&#8211;pull systems. The photoluminescence quantum yields of Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 in aprotic solvents were 0.90 and higher regardless of solvent polarity, while they decreased in protic solvents. The molecules also display high extinction coefficients of up to 2.8x104 and 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of structurally rigid planar COPV framework. Furthermore, [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO showed significant responses to water content in tetrahydrofuran&#8208;water mixed solvents, which highlights its potential for sensing applications.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Azidative Functionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes is a powerful way to produce valuable chiral alkyl azides. This review summarizes the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes over the past quarter of a century. Four reaction models, including conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer, are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Aliphatic azides are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds found in numerous biologically active molecules. Besides, they also serve as useful building blocks owning to their remarkable reactivities. Catalytic azidation of alkenes is an efficient way to produce aliphatic azides. In this respect, azidated chiral molecules can be formed if a chiral catalyst is used. The last quarter of century has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes to yield chiral alkyl azides. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes systematically, from the view of reaction models (conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer) combining the roles that azido sources play (nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical). This review will be useful to the fields of azide chemistry and asymmetric alkene functionalization.

         <title>Urea as an Amine Source to Synthesize Primary Aromatic Amines via Nickel&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an efficient and regiospecific approach for the direct synthesis of primary aromatic amines through nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H amination, utilizing urea &#8211; an abundant, non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical &#8211; as a sustainable amine source. This method eliminates the need for conventional protection and deprotection steps, offering a streamlined solution for the amination of arenes.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient method has been developed for the transformation of aromatic CAr&#8722;H bond into CAr&#8722;NH&#8322; via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation, eliminating the need for additional protection and deprotection steps. This strategy employs 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a directing group and urea as the nitrogen source, a non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical. The reaction exhibits high selectivity, exclusively yielding mono&#8208;aminated primary aromatic amines. Furthermore, the protocol is tolerant of a wide range of substrates with various functional groups, producing the corresponding ortho&#8208;aminobenzamides in yields ranging from 38&#8201;% to 73&#8201;%. The preliminary results indicate the C&#8722;H bond cleavage is likely the rate&#8208;determining step in the reaction.

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the calix[4]arene&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered oxa&#8208; and azacycles, utilizing organic small molecules as starting materials.







Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds are not only ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials, but also function as essential ligands in both organic and medical chemistry. Among the current synthetic strategies, organocatalysis has garnered considerable attention in recent years owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, high catalytic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. In the realm of heterocycle synthesis via organocatalysis, calix[4]arenes have emerged as prominent catalysts. This review aims to highlight significant advancements in the calix[4]arene&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds using organic small molecules as starting materials over the past decade.

This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in multicomponent reactions of indoles from 2014 to 2024, focusing on site&#8208;selective synthesis strategies, catalytic systems, reaction mechanisms and their applications in constructing various indole derivatives, and also discusses the future development trends in this field.







Abstract
Indoles, which are distinguished by their nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic structure, play a pivotal role in organic chemistry due to their diverse biological profiles and unique chemical reactivity. In particular, poly&#8208;substituted indoles are extensively found in a wide range of natural products, pharmaceuticals, materials, and bioactive compounds. The integration of indoles into multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has emerged as a powerful synthetic strategy, facilitating the construction of these complex poly&#8208;substituted indole frameworks from simple precursors. This review highlights the latest advancements in MCRs involving indoles, focusing on innovative methodologies for site&#8208;selective synthesis of indole derivatives, catalytic systems, mechanistic insights, and their applications. The review encompasses significant developments from 2014 to 2024 and covers a variety of indole MCRs, including those targeting the C3 position, dual&#8208;site reactions at the C2 and C3 positions, and reactions involving the pyrrole and benzene rings of the indole scaffold.

         <title>A Platinum(0) Complex as &#960;&#8208;Lewis Base Catalyst for Asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt0 complex functions as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to promote the asymmetric Friedel&#8722;Crafts reaction of unsaturated carbonyl&#8208;tethered heteroarenes upon dihapto&#8208;coordination, and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity is achieved.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate that a Pt0 complex can function as an efficient &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of deactivated heteroarenes upon &#951;2&#8208;coordination and resultant &#960;&#8208;backdonation, thus enabling asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with electrophiles. A diversity of densely functionalized adducts are produced in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Preliminary frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations and in&#8197;situ 1H NMR analysis support the Pt0 &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalytic mode.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing 6&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes: Bicyclic Piperidine Analogs for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are proposed as advanced building blocks for early drug discovery programs. For this purpose, their straightforward multigram synthesis, physicochemical, and structural characterization were performed. Effects of fluorine&#8208;containing substituents and the bicyclic system on the compound's pKa, LogP, and conformational behavior in the crystalline state were demonstrated.







Abstract
Convenient synthetic approaches to a series of fluorinated bicyclic piperidine analogs (including 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;, 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes) were proposed. Using commercially available fluorination agents, the target building blocks were prepared in gram to decagram scale in a single run. Evaluation of pKa and LogP values revealed the importance of the fluorine&#8208;containing substituent and methylene bridge relative disposition for the compound's physicochemical properties. Analysis of molecular structure using the exit vector plot (EVP) approach revealed negligible change in molecules conformation upon fluorination.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Formation of a Decasubstituted Phenanthrene by Coupling and Fragmentation of a Smaller Precursor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When epoxynaphthalene 5 is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is the decasubstituted phenanthrene 6, formed by Ullmann coupling and a surprising fragmentation and rearrangement.







Abstract
When 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (5) is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is 1,8&#8208;dibenzoyl&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10&#8208;octaphenylphenanthrene (6) in yields as high as 68&#8201;%. The reaction appears to involve Ullmann coupling of 5 and expulsion of two molecules of diphenylacetylene to give a decaphenyl bis(isobenzofuran) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization and fragmentation to yield phenanthrene 6.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems Based on Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) cores were employed to develop acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores. These compounds demonstrated extensive visible&#8208;light absorption and complex redox properties, including &#960;&#8208;dimer and mixed&#8208;valence formations. Computational studies revealed tunable electronic transitions, while preliminary solar cell tests led to promising efficiency, showcasing IDT&#8208;TTF's as a versatile donor unit for organic electronics.







Abstract
Here, we present a series of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8722;D&#8208;A) conjugated molecules incorporating an indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) as the central electron&#8208;donating moiety, functionalized with various lateral electron acceptors. A key synthetic step was the Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack formylation of the IDT&#8208;TTF, providing the dialdehyde in quantitative yield. This compound was further used for the incorporation of dicyanovinyl and indanedione acceptors. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy of the A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds in solution revealed a broad absorption in the visible spectrum which is further red&#8208;shifted when proceeding from solutions to thin films. Their cyclic voltammograms in solution showed a multi&#8208;redox behavior &#8211; undergoing both oxidation and reduction events. Notably, the oxidation of these compounds unveiled the formation of intermolecular mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species, especially strong in the case of the indanedione&#8208;containing derivative. Computational calculations helped us to identify the electronic transitions involved in the main absorption bands of these A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds displaying different behaviors depending on the acceptor attached to the IDT&#8208;TTF core. Finally, the potential of these compounds as donors in organic solar cells was investigated and the best performing solar cell exhibited a modest yet promising power conversion efficiency of 0.87&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in the &#945;&#8208;Hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;Amination) of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, notable progress has been achieved in the &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds, especially in the direct asymmetric electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination with dialkyl azodicarboxylates. This review summarizes all the methods that appeared over the past decade, categorized based on the type of the reactive chiral intermediate (enamine, enol, enolate). Other reaction types are discussed at the end.







Abstract
The electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (generally referred to as &#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds with dialkyl azodicarboxylates is a powerful approach for the preparation of synthetically useful intermediates such as &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes and ketones, &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Many methods for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination have been published in the past and many new approaches have been disclosed in the last decade that deal with previously unresolved issues such as the direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination of &#945;&#8208;branched ketones. The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination is the field where most significant advances have been attained thanks to new approaches, catalysts and techniques. With this review we intend to cover the literature that appeared between 2015 and 2024. We will classify the various methods according to the strategies for the enantioselective formation of the new C&#8722;N bond, mainly based on the formation of chiral enamines, enols and enolates. Miscellaneous methods are grouped at the end of the review. Where relevant, the application of &#945;&#8208;hydrazino carbonyl compounds to the synthesis of target molecules will also be illustrated.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of Tetrahydropyrimidines and Dihydropyrrolidones through Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Amines, 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes, and Alkyne Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent reaction is developed for the synthesis of heterocycles under mild conditions. Amines, 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes, and alkyne esters are assembled for the construction of tetrahydropyrimidines and dihydropyrrolidones, the chemoselectivity of the reaction is controlled by the substitution of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes. During the transformation, aryl substituted triazinanes serve as three&#8208;atom synthons, and alkyl substituted triazinanes work as two&#8208;atom synthons.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of amines, 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes, and alkyne esters for the construction of tetrahydropyrimidines and dihydropyrrolidones derivatives was reported. Shifting the substituent group of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes led to the chemoselective synthesis. As three&#8208;atom synthons, aryl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were applied to the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydropyrimidines. Alkyl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes working as two&#8208;atom synthons promoted intramolecular cyclization to generate dihydropyrrolidones analogues. The practicality of the developed methods was demonstrated by easy operation, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and good functional groups tolerance.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Synthesis of Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the photochemical synthesis of esters, including cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with aryl or alkyl halides, phenols and aldehydes or alcohols, alcohols with &#945;&#8208;keto acids, alcohols or phenols with benzaldehydes or benzylic alcohols as well as aldehydes and benzyl or alkyl halides, emphasizing the development of novel protocols, limitations and strategies for expanding the utility.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for making a variety of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The development of esterification reactions induced by light is an atom economical and energy efficient alternative to traditional methods for the synthesis of esters, with benefits including mild reaction conditions, high chemical yields, and wide functional group tolerance. This review summarizes recent progress made in this green methodology, including mechanisms of action, substrate scope, limitations and future prospects.

         <title>Automated and Parallel Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a streamlined, automated method for synthesizing amide&#8208;containing compounds, crucial in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Utilizing pre&#8208;packed capsules and 96&#8208;well plate kits, this user&#8208;friendly approach simplifies the reaction and isolation processes, accommodating diverse reactants. This work allows to enhance medicinal chemistry by accelerating the creation of compound libraries with high efficiency and yield.







Abstract
Amide bonds are ubiquitous in molecules of interest such as pharmaceuticals, natural products, and agrochemicals. Over the last decades, significant efforts have been directed at developing efficient methods for the formation of this class of chemical bonds. Herein, we disclose a robust, user&#8208;friendly approach for the efficient and rapid parallel synthesis of amide&#8208;containing compounds, in good yield and purity. Our approach utilizes automated synthesis technologies and pre&#8208;packed capsules containing all the necessary materials for the reaction and work&#8208;up. Following manual addition of the amine and carboxylic acid, the reaction and product isolation is achieved automatically in a standardized, integrated manner. This methodology tolerates a wide diversity of carboxylic acids and amines (or amine salts). To accelerate discovery and rapidly create amide&#8208;containing compound libraries, the method was miniaturized into an automated parallel synthesis format, using 96&#8208;well plate kits, which could be beneficial to medicinal chemists.

         <title>Water Mediated Chemoselective Synthesis of Novel Spiro Benzoxazinoindoline and Extended Synthesis of Spiro Benzoxazinoindene Derivatives*</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a greener and novel synthesis of Water&#8208;mediated Spiro benzoxazinoindoline and Sprio benzoxazinoindene compounds, a class of spiro compounds highly valued for their properties and significant medicinal potential. We report over more than 30 novel examples synthesized using green and sustainable process, easy operational steps, achieving good to excellent yields. This pioneering research paves the way for synthetic organic chemists to explore novel approaches in the development of Spiro compounds.







Abstract
Spirobenzoxazines are a unique class of heterocyclic compounds that combine the structural features of spiro and benzooxazine frameworks, offering enhanced chemical stability and diverse biological activities. Their rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures make them ideal candidates for interacting with biological targets, contributing to their potential in various therapeutic applications, including anticancer, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibition. However, the development of efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazines remains a challenge in organic synthesis. In this work, we present a novel and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazine derivatives. Utilizing water as a green solvent, this methodology offers an efficient and sustainable route for constructing these complex heterocyclic frameworks. By emphasizing eco&#8208;friendly practices, this approach aligns with the principles of green chemistry, providing both high yields and operational simplicity. This advancement not only highlights the potential of spirobenzoxazines in the pharmaceutical and material sciences but also paves the way for future research in sustainable synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Effect of Substituents on the Tautomerism of Pyridone Nucleoside Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical work shows that the predominant tautomer of 6&#8208;fluoropyridones is the lactim, not the lactam form. This makes them analogs of cytosine, not uracil or thymine in the context of incorporation opposite complementary bases of genetic sequences.







Abstract
Nucleobase analogs are important tools in medicine and chemical biology, as they offer molecular targeting options for the intervention in genetic processes. Pyridone C&#8208;nucleosides have been shown to pair with adenine in complementary strands, but a switch from the lactam to lactim form may change their base pairing preference. We synthesized 6&#8208;fluoropyridone analogs of aciclovir and cidofovir, which we assumed to be in the lactam form, but were found to lack activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Spectroscopic data then indicated that they are predominantly in the lactim form, with a hydrogen bonding pattern suitable for G. The tautomerism of fluoropyridones was then studied by UV&#8208;spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The UV spectroscopic pattern for either tautomer was corroborated by synthesizing N&#8208; and O&#8208;methylated model compounds, and measuring their spectra. The tautomeric equilibrium of selected other substituted pyridones is predicted, based on density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Free Ketone Synthesis via Radical Coupling Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for the preparation of various ketones via radical coupling mechanisms using photoredox catalysis was described. The reaction was promoted by one&#8208;electron reduction of acyl imidazole without the involvement of NHC. The method exhibited broad tolerance to a variety of alkyl radical substrates, including alkyl boronic acids, boronic esters, alkyl trifluoroborates, carboxylic acids, and Hantzsch esters.







Abstract
Ketone synthesis via radical coupling mechanisms has recently gained significant attention. Traditionally, these methods have relied on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to generate the key ketyl radical intermediate, either through single&#8208;electron reduction of acyl azolium or single&#8208;electron oxidation involving the Breslow intermediate. In this report, we introduce a novel photoredox protocol that directly generates ketyl radicals from stable acyl imidazoles without the need for NHCs. This approach not only simplifies the process, but also demonstrates broad tolerance for various alkyl radical substrates. Additionally, it can be extended to facilitate relay&#8208;radical coupling reactions.

Traditionally, these methods have relied on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to generate the key ketyl radical intermediate, either through single-electron reduction of acyl azolium or single-electron oxidation involving the Breslow intermediate. In this report, we introduce a novel photoredox protocol that directly generates ketyl radicals from stable acyl imidazoles without the need for NHCs. This approach not only simplifies the process, but also demonstrates broad tolerance for various alkyl radical substrates. Additionally, it can be extended to facilitate relay-radical coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Reactions of Alkynyl Sulfides: Versatile Tools in Synthetic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a review of recent advances on catalytic transformations of alkynyl sulfides since 2004. Four different types of reaction modes, including the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization, electrophilic addition, radical&#8208;initiated functionalization, and formal [2+n] cycloaddition, are presented, with an emphasis on analysis of reaction mechanisms and key facts for controlling the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Alkynyl sulfides, a significant class of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkynes, have garnered considerable attention within the synthetic community because of their distinctive characteristics, such as the enhanced reactivity, precise selectivity control, and facile derivatization via C&#8722;S bond couplings. Their transformations can provide a direct access to functionalized organosulfur and even sulfur&#8208;free compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, which is very attractive for many fields, including organic synthesis, material science, medicinal chemistry, and life science. This review summarizes the recent progresses on catalytic reactions of alkynyl sulfides, such as the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed controllable functionalizations, including hydro&#8208;, hetero&#8208;, and carbofunctionalizations, electrophilic additions, radical addition&#8208;initiated functionalizations, and formal [2+n] cycloadditions, in which the reaction mechanism, selectivity control, scope and limitations are discussed in detail. Given the rapidly increasing interests and applications of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in both chemistry and life science, it can be anticipated that this review will be valuable for synthetic chemists and may contribute further development of the alkynyl sulfide chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters: Impact of Reaction Parameters &amp; Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters represents a highly atom&#8208;economical route towards &#946;&#8209;aldehydes with the potential application as precursors for derivatization to pharmaceuticals such as (R)&#8209;Baclofen or Pregabalin. Methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate as an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester has been rarely studied in hydroformylation, particularly with regard to a parameter screening for reaction optimization. In this work, the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8209;chlorocinnamate to the desired &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was investigated with a particular focus on the identification of parameters with a significant effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde amongst all products. The reaction time, solvent, and catalyst loading were initially screened followed by a systematic screening using design of experiments (DoE). The reaction output was analyzed in terms of pressure, temperature and the CO/H2 composition with an unmodified Rh&#160;catalyst revealing that while either regioselectivity or overall selectivity (termed selectivity) can attain high values, neither parameter can simultaneously reach optimal levels. As predicted by the model, the experimental results under two different conditions demonstrated excellent regioselectivity (96%) with medium selectivity (57%) and a high selectivity (78&#160;%) with good regioselectivity (93%). Expansion of substrate scope revealed a significant influence of the substituents and thus the electronic effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An approach to functionalization of cucurbit[n]uril through a tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent</title>

         <dc:description>A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <title>Samarium Diiodide/Samarium&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Hydroborylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A samarium diiodide/samarium&#8208;mediated direct deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes with hydroborate ester has been reported. In this method, unactivated aldehydes and hydroborate ester have been employed as starting materials for the synthesis of primary alkyl borate esters. Broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance has been demonstrated that this is a robust method for deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
