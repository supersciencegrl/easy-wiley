         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides to [60]Fullerene: Thermodynamic Control of Bis&#8208;Addition with Ionic Liquids Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a kaleidoscopic vision of the frontier empty orbitals of [60]fulleropyrrolidine embracing diverse [6,6] bonds, which poses a severe regioselectivity challenge for further ylide cycloaddition, resulting in a multitude of polyfunctionalization products. A combined kinetic and mechanistic study is reported to interrogate the thermodynamic drivers, leading to stable fulleropyrrolidine bis&#8208;adducts, using MW&#8208;assisted heating and ionic liquids additives. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Carraro, M. Prato, M. Bonchio et&#8197;al.

         <title>Intermolecular Photoredox Coupling: Alternative to Norrish Type II Reaction and Yang Cyclization in Ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the revisited photochemistry of butyrophenone. The bright sun and beautiful nature are symbolizing the photons as clean energy source. After excitation, pathways to wander downhill are standing for different deactivation routes which the system can undergo. A new reaction pathway is reported. In addition to the Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization, intermolecular species are generated: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane and pinacols. They account for approx. 20% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The authors would like to thank the Provadis School (Frankfurt, emblem shown right) for making this work possible. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Hoffmann and M.&#8197;W. Tausch.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the structure of a molecule containing two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units separated by an acetylenic linker that allows the redox&#8208;active units to intramolecularly associate when either neutral or oxidized. A semi&#8208;conducting salt of the dicationic molecule was obtained by electrocrystallization using an H&#8208;shaped cell. The cover picture was designed by Viktor Bliksted Roug Pedersen. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Nielsen et&#8197;al.

         <title>3,10&#8208;Diaryl Phenothiazines &#8211; One&#8208;pot Synthesis and Conformational Tuning of Ground and Excited State Electronics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 24, Page 3516-3527, June 25, 2021. </description>

3,10&#8208;Diaryl phenothiazines by sequential one&#8208;pot catalysis allow planar and linear correlations of ground and excited state electronic properties depending on extra and intra conformations.







Abstract
A broad series of electronically diverse 3,10&#8208;diaryl phenothiazines was readily synthesized by a sequentially Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component arylation&#8208;amination synthesis in a one&#8208;pot fashion in moderate to excellent yields. The diversity&#8208;oriented modular nature of the multicomponent reaction concept enables comprehensive investigations of electronic properties of the title compounds by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations to elucidate their electronic structure. The electronic properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by the fundamental conformational change from intra to extra configuration as well as by introducing different remote electronic substituents. Physical&#8208;organic treatment of the electronic data of a consanguineous series of this library allows establishing semiquantitative linear free energy relationships (LFERs), eventually as a 3D plot for the first oxidation potentials, paves the way to a rational design of tailored 3,10&#8208;diaryl phenothiazines with predictable oxidation potentials and photophysical properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broad series of electronically diverse 3,10-diaryl phenothiazines was readily synthesized by a sequentially Pd-catalyzed three-component arylation-amination synthesis in a one-pot fashion in moderate to excellent yields. The diversity-oriented modular nature of the multicomponent reaction concept enables comprehensive investigations of electronic properties of the title compounds by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations to elucidate their electronic structure. The electronic properties can be fine-tuned by the fundamental conformational change from &lt;i&gt;intra&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; configuration as well as by introducing different remote electronic substituents. Physical-organic treatment of the electronic data of a consanguineous series of this library allows establishing semiquantitative linear free energy relationships (LFERs), eventually as a 3D plot for the first oxidation potentials, paves the way to a rational design of tailored 3,10-diaryl phenothiazines with predictable oxidation potentials and photophysical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Domino Processes Involving the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8722;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been studied computationally as well as experimentally. Key intermediates and transition states have been identified, which allow to improve the reaction conditions as well as to develop new transformations in the future.







Abstract
The detailed understanding of mechanisms is the basis to design new reactions. Herein, we studied the domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction developed in our laboratory computationally as well as by synthetic experiments, to characterize different pathways. A quinodimethane intermediate was identified as key structure, which is the basis for all subsequent transformations: Elimination to an aromatic naphthalene, rearrangement to a dihydroaminonaphthalene and a photo&#8208;induced ring opening. These insights allow to optimize the reaction conditions, such as catalytic utilization of amine, as well as to advance new reactions in the future.

         <title>Nucleophilic Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,6&#8208;Anhydrosugars: Recent Advances and Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 24, Page 3501-3515, June 25, 2021. </description>

The stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening of 1,6&#8208;anhydrosugars with various nucleophiles leading to natural products, glycomimetics and other compounds of biological interest is covered with recent, relevant examples.







Abstract
1,6&#8208;Anhydrosugars provide a valuable source of building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds of interest, from natural products to medicines. The unique reactivity of these functionalized, homochiral synthons is controlled by the 1,6&#8208;anhydro bridge which locks the conformation of the pyranose ring, provides a dual protection of two hydroxyl groups, and either protects or activates the anomeric position. The concomitant release of the primary hydroxyl group at C&#8208;6 during the ring&#8208;opening step limits protecting group manipulations and enables the design of highly convergent synthetic strategies. In recent years, many examples of stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening of 1,6&#8208;anhydrosugars by a diversity of nucleophiles, including hetero&#8208; and C&#8208;nucleophiles, have been reported. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of the recent advances, applications and challenges associated with this process.

         <title>Intramolecular Electrochemical Oxybromination of Olefins for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines in Batch and Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 24, Page 3496-3500, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrochemical method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;isoxazolines is reported. The reaction operates under atmospheric conditions and tolerates air and moisture. The use of potassium bromide as both electrolyte and bromine source precludes the need for toxic, air&#8208;sensitive inorganic oxidants or transition metal catalysts.







Abstract
A highly regioselective protocol for the synthesis of isoxazolines through cascade C&#8722;O and C&#8722;Br bond formation has been developed. The electrochemical approach uses traceless electrons as a sole source of oxidant, thus avoiding the use of stoichiometric organic or inorganic oxidants and provides a mild and environmentally benign alternative pathway for the synthesis of a wide range of valuable substituted isoxazolines from alkenyl oximes in good yields.

Macrocyclic tris&#8208;malonate incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been used for the regioselective tris&#8208;functionalization of C60. Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. Further functionalization has been carried out to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.

Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. The bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been cleaved to liberate the terminal alcohol functions of the fullerene tris&#8208;adduct.

         <dc:description>
A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. Upon functionalization of the fullerene sphere, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating either di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene or tetra&#8208;iso&#8208;propyldisiloxane subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. By systematically changing the length and the rigidity of the spacer units linking the malonate moieties to the silylated protecting groups, fullerene bis&#8208;adducts with different addition patterns have been obtained. Finally, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.

The synthesis of &#969;&#8208;alkenylallylboronate derivatives is described for the first time. In addition, their performance in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed allylboration/RCM tandem sequence is studied. Cyclic alcohols, displaying the hydroxyl functionality at an exocyclic position and two consecutive stereocenters, are obtained as single diastereoisomers and in high degree of enantioselectivity, in most of the cases.







Abstract
The synthesis of allylboronates bearing an alkenyl moiety appended at a remote position is described for the first time. For that aim, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of the corresponding allylic alcohols was used as the key step. The required allylic alcohols were in turn obtained in 3&#8211;4 step sequences. The presence of an extra alkenyl moiety at a strategic position allows the triggering of a tandem asymmetric allylation/RCM reaction sequence that efficiently affords different sized cycles featuring two consecutive stereocenters and an exocyclic alcohol function. Products are obtained in moderate to excellent yields and high enantioselectivities, in most of the cases.

The nitrogen mustard gas moiety is present as a basic, amine&#8208;containing side chain in numerous pharmacophore scaffolds engaging in crucial interactions with targeted biological macromolecules. Herein, a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of nitrogen mustard&#8208;like moieties through dialkyl carbonate chemistry into different phenolic substrates is reported. The scope and limitations of this reaction as a chlorine&#8208;free direct substitution of the phenolic &#8722;OH group have been investigated.







Abstract
N,N&#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moiety can be found in numerous scaffolds of macromolecules, catalysts, and especially pharmaceuticals. Common synthetic procedures for its incorporation in a substrate relies on the use of a nitrogen mustard gas or on multistep syntheses featuring chlorine hazardous/toxic chemistry. Reported herein is a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of aminoalkyl chain into different phenolic substrates through dialkyl carbonate (&#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate) chemistry. This new direct alcohol substitution avoids the use of chlorine chemistry, and it is efficient on numerous pharmacophore scaffolds with good to quantitative yield. The cytotoxicity via MTT of the &#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate, key intermediate of this synthetic approach, was also evaluated and compared with its alcohol precursor.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;P Cross&#8208;Coupling of (Cyclo)alkenyl/Aryl Bromides and Secondary Phosphine Oxides with in&#8197;situ Halogen Exchange</title>

A protocol for copper&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange/C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling between (cyclo)alkenyl/aryl bromides and secondary phosphine oxides has been developed. The addition of sodium iodide increases the yield of the cross&#8208;coupling by promoting in&#8197;situ halogen exchange of organic bromides to the corresponding iodides.







Abstract
An efficient protocol for concurrent tandem halogen exchange/C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling of cycloalkenyl bromides and secondary phosphine oxides has been developed. The catalytic system is based on cheap and air&#8208;stable copper(I) iodide as the precatalyst, commercially available N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine as the ligand, and Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 as the base. The use of sodium iodide as an additive reduces the excessive use of organic bromides to near&#8208;stoichiometric by promoting the in&#8197;situ transformation to the corresponding iodides. Diarylphosphine oxides undergo cycloalkenylation with 35&#8211;99&#8201;% yields and dicyclohexylphosphine oxide with 30&#8211;53&#8201;% yields. In the case of acyclic alkenyl bromides the cross&#8208;coupling products undergo conjugate addition of diphenylphosphine oxide and satisfying yields are observed only for internal olefins. In the case of aryl bromides satisfying yields (43&#8211;72&#8201;%) are observed only for sterically unhindered arenes or arenes possessing an ortho&#8208;directing group. Cycloalkenylphosphine oxides prepared in the cross&#8208;coupling reaction undergo base&#8208;catalyzed and base&#8208;promoted conjugate addition to give bis(phosphinoyl)cycloalkanes.

         <title>An Intramolecular Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation as a Versatile Tool for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans</title>

The first iodine&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols gives access to tetrahydrofurans through an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. The reaction proceeds under mild reactions using either a floodlight lamp or daylight.







Abstract
The formation of ubiquitous occurring tetrahydrofuran patterns has been extensively investigated in the 1960s as it was one of the first examples of a non&#8208;directed remote C&#8722;H activation. These approaches suffer from the use of toxic transition metals in overstoichiometric amounts. An attractive metal&#8208;free solution for transforming carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds into carbon&#8208;oxygen bonds lies in applying economically and ecologically favorable iodine reagents. The presented method involves an intertwined catalytic cycle of a radical chain reaction and an iodine(I/III) redox couple by selectively activating a remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, is operationally simple and tolerates many functional groups giving fast and easy access to different substituted tetrahydrofurans.

         <title>Michael Addition&#8208;Elimination and [4+1] Annulation of Sulfonylphthalide with Hydroxychalcones for the Synthesis of Alkylidenephthalides and Indanediones</title>

         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of alkylidenephthalides through Michael addition&#8208;elimination has been demonstrated by employing 3&#8208;sulfonylphthalide and o&#8208;hydroxychalcones. Interestingly, the conjugated styrenyl o&#8208;hydroxychalcones afforded unsymmetrical indanediones through [4+1] Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation. The strategically located phenolic group plays a pivotal role in controlling the reaction pathways. The alkylidenephthalides which are latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds were further transformed into triarylfurans in good to excellent yields under Paal&#8208;Knorr conditions.







Abstract
A protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of alkylidenephthalides and indanediones has been developed through the reaction of o&#8208;hydroxychalcones and their styrenyl analogues, respectively, with 3&#8208;sulfonylphthalide. The mechanism for the former synthesis involves Michael addition&#8208;E2 elimination sequence, while the latter involves a [4+1] Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation. The mechanistic studies reveal that the strategically positioned phenolic group plays a pivotal role in the observed reactivities. The alkylidenephthalides, which are latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, were further converted to triarylfurans under Paal&#8208;Knorr conditions in good to excellent yields. This protocol unravels several key features such as substrate specific product formation, namely, alkylidenephthalides from chalcones, and indanediones from vinylogous chalcones in their reaction with 3&#8208;sulfonylphthalide as well as the role of alkylidenephthalides as 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl surrogates in Paal&#8208;Knorr furan synthesis.

         <title>Front Cover: Mustard Carbonate Analogues as Sustainable Reagents for the Aminoalkylation of Phenols (24/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 24, Page 3458-3458, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the one&#8208;pot procedure for the introduction of aminoalkyl chain through dialkyl carbonate chemistry into different phenolic substrates. This green approach is a direct alcohol substitution that avoids the use of chlorine chemistry giving CO2 and ethanol as the only reaction by&#8208;products. The proposed procedure has numerous potential applications as N,N&#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moieties are incorporated in many pharmacophore scaffolds such as Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, Amiodarone, Phenyltoloxamine and Trifenagrel. The authors thank Thomas Bassano for creating the artwork. More information can be found in the Communication by F. Aric&#242; et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis and Racemization Studies of Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 24, Page 3465-3471, June 25, 2021. </description>

Winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyls are synthesized. The molecule formed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis hardly racemized (&#916;G=&gt;200&#8197;kJmol&#8722;1), even at harsh condition under refluxing chlorobenzene and the one by nosyl annulation also showed higher racemization barrier (ca. 130&#8197;kJmol&#8722;1) compared with the related bithiophene derivatives, which were prepared previously (ca. 70&#8211;100&#8197;kJmol&#8722;1).







Abstract
Winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl derivatives were synthesized through the annulation reaction of nosylated (2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl) ethylenediamine and the E&#8208;selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction. The structures of the cyclized products were confirmed by measurements of 1H and 13C NMR spectra and single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. The obtained cyclic product was revealed to exhibit molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analyses on chiral stationary phase. Compared with our previous results on the related bithiophene derivatives, the obtained vine&#8208;shaped biphenyls were shown to hardly racemize under ambient conditions and experimental studies on racemization behaviors suggested energy barriers of 134&#8197;kJmol&#8722;1 to 211&#8197;kJmol&#8722;1. These results reasonably agreed with those of the calculated values based on DFT.

         <title>Reactivity and Applications of Iodine Monochloride in Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for discovering new protocols to conduct reactions including halogenations, oxidations and cyclizations has recently led to a renaissance in studying reactions involving somewhat forgotten halogen&#8208;containing reactants. This Minireview documents the processes that have employed iodine monochloride, an intriguing, highly polarized compound composed of sole iodine and chlorine atoms.







Abstract
Over the last half&#8208;decade, routes towards accessing halogenated compounds of value such as bioactive pharmaceuticals, organic building blocks has been of interest to the synthetic community. The demand for new methodologies to access important compounds has surged over the period. Amongst the halogenating agents available in a chemist's toolbox, one reagent in particular, iodine monochloride (ICl), is relatively under employed in comparison to alternatives such as molecular iodine for example. In this Minireview, we document the most recent applications (2015&#8211;2020) of ICl in synthetic organic transformations, namely halogenations including iodinations and chlorination reactions, cyclizations, metathesis reactions as well as oxidation processes. Furthermore, its versatile nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides to [60]Fullerene: Thermodynamic Control of Bis&#8208;Addition with Ionic Liquids Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene has been performed in the presence of ionic liquids and under microwave (MW) dielectric heating. As confirmed by DFT calculations, a converging kinetic and thermodynamic control favors the selective formation of the less sterically hindered and most stable bis&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine regioisomers.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene (C60) has been studied in ortho&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) by evaluating the impact of an ionic liquid (IL) additive. The solvent effect has been addressed by evaluating the activation parameters of the cycloaddition and the boosting effect of the microwave (MW) induced dielectric heating. The IL additive plays a twofold role of stabilizing the dipolar ylide intermediate and favoring the retro&#8208;cycloaddition at high temperature regime. Under the conditions explored, a combined kinetic and thermodynamic preference favors the selective formation of trans bis&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine regioisomers, in agreement with the DFT computational analysis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the construction of racemic and enantiopure biaryl unnatural amino acid derivatives via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective sp3 C&#8208;H activation and arylation of amino acid derivatives with iodobiaryls. The synthesis of biaryl motif installed (DL&#8208;), L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acid derivatives including norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid with anti stereochemistry have been reported. The synthesis of alanine derivatives with two biaryl motifs and aminoalkanoic acids with biaryl motifs were also shown. The C&#8208;H arylation of enantiopure carboxamides gave biaryl amino acid derivatives with good enantiopurity. Removal of the directing group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline, deprotection of the phthalimide moiety and the preparation of biaryl amino acid derivatives containing free amino&#8208; and carboxylate groups were shown. The stereochemistry (anti) of representative major diastereomers was unequivocally ascertained from X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Biaryl amino acids/peptides are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, and this work therefore represents a contribution towards enriching the library of biaryl amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step conversion of amides and esters to acid chlorides with PCl3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and efficient iodine&#8208;promoted chlorination of amides and esters with phosphorus trichloride is described.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Automated synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi phosphorylated peptides are key tools in understanding the biological roles of protein phosphorylation patterns. In this work, we focused on multi phosphorylated peptides with over four, clustered, phosphorylation site that are termed herein heavily phosphorylated peptides (HPPs). The synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides is extremely difficult and requires the use of wide temperature range. Standard peptide synthesizers are incapable of both cooling and heating, which impedes the automated synthesis of those peptides. Here, we used the oligosaccharide synthesizer Glyconeer 2.1 to develop a protocol for the automated synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides. The Glyconeer 2.1 is able to both cool and heat, which enabled the development of highly controlled coupling and deprotection conditions that were used for the automated synthesis of four different heavily phosphorylated peptides with five or more, clustered, phosphorylation sites. Our approach paves the way for easy automated synthesis of a variety of heavily phosphorylated peptides.</dc:description>

Abstract
Tandem, one&#8208;pot, multicomponent reaction for direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides scaffolds are illustrated. The basic nature of phosphoramide leads to a diverse set of in&#8197;situ generated Michael acceptors making the reactions highly atom and step economical. The reaction conditions are mild, entirely metal&#8208; and external additives free. Alkylated phosphoramides were obtained with good yields and selectivity using visible&#8208;light organo&#8208;photocatalysis.

         <title>Dimeric Indenofluorene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Motif for Enhanced Intramolecular Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (IF&#8208;TTFs) with acetylenic bridging units were prepared by stepwise acetylenic coupling reactions. A strong propensity to undergo intramolecular stacking of the two IF&#8208;TTF units was observed spectroscopically for both the neutral and oxidized species. Electrocrystallization provided a solid, semi&#8208;conducting material where each IF&#8208;TTF unit is oxidized to its radical cation.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) is a redox&#8208;active compound, which reversibly undergoes two one&#8208;electron oxidations to give stable species. Several features of TTF, such as redox and optical properties as well as geometry and self&#8208;associating nature, can be tuned by extension of the conjugated system with an aromatic linker such as an indenofluorene (IF) moiety. In this work we present the synthesis of a novel dimeric scaffold of IF&#8208;extended TTF (IF&#8208;TTF) in which the units are linked by a rigid 1,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne moiety. 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that the scaffold is highly prone to form intramolecular IF&#8208;TTF dimer complexes even in the neutral form, and stable radical cation species were formed in solution upon chemical oxidation with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (&#8216;magic blue&#8217;). Electrocrystallization of the rigid scaffold yielded a semi&#8208;conducting material, which proved to be stable at ambient temperature and air.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Heterocycles via Base Metal&#8208;catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative and Borrowing Hydrogen Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development in the area of acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) and borrowing hydrogen (BH) catalysis emerge as one of the potential tools for various C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. Alcohols, which are important lignocellulosic biomass product, act as pivotal electrophilic coupling partner in such processes and interestingly only H  2  or H  2  O is eliminated as a byproduct. Initially, the area was developed by the use of noble metal catalysts. Recently, base metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni proved to be environmentally benign and inexpensive alternatives for the noble metals in the application of AD and BH methods. This transition metal catalyzed AD and BH approaches also allow access toward a plethora of structurally important heterocyclic molecules  via  environmentally benign and atom economical strategy. Herein, we summarize the current and rising expansion of base metal catalyzed heterocycles synthesis  via  acceptorless dehydrogenation and borrowing hydrogenation strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Convenient multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines and 2&#8208;aminothiazoles using elemental sulfur under aqueous conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot aqueous reaction for the synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines and 2&#8208;aminothiazoles using isocyanides, amines, sulfur and 2&#8242;&#8208;bromoacetophenones. The three&#8208;component preparation of thioureas is followed one&#8208;pot by the cyclization leading to the heterocycle. This efficient and mild procedure features excellent step&#8211; and atom&#8211;economy and enables the chromatography&#8211;free preparation of diversely substituted 2&#8208;iminothiazoline and 2&#8208;aminothiazole derivatives.</dc:description>

3&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodothiophenes are obtained by iodocyclization of 1,3&#8208;dithianyl substituted propargylamine derivatives through iodine induced cleavage of dithiane ring in a bicyclic sulfonium intermediate. 1&#8208;(1,3&#8208;Dithian&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propargylamines are readily available by Au&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 1,3&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes, amines, and alkynes in a one&#8208;pot.







Abstract
1&#8208;(1,3&#8208;Dithian&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propargylamines undergo iodo&#8208;cylization regioselectively to afford tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodothiophenes in 30&#8211;87&#8201;% yields by iodide induced cleavage of dithiane ring in a bicyclic sulfonium intermediate. A mechanism for this unprecedented transformation was proposed and tentatively supported by the isolation of an intermediate structure. 1&#8208;(1,3&#8208;Dithian&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propargylamines were prepared in 30&#8211;94&#8201;% yields by Au&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes, amines, and alkynes so called A3&#8208;coupling reaction.

         <title>Luminescent Imidazolium Salts as Bright Multi&#8208;Faceted Tools for Biology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium salts bearing fluorophore units can be easily tuned to encompass the desired properties to explore the biological world and provide tools for medicine. Luminescence allows anion detection and cell imaging, while antibacterial and anticancer activities are also reported, as well as drug and gene delivery when the amphipathic character of the salt is delicately controlled.







Abstract
Light and cognate phenomena, e.&#8201;g., luminescence are powerful tools endowed with great sensitivity to explore the infinitely small. Molecular salts, especially those based on imidazolium units, are granted with original properties and structural versatility. Associated with fluorophores, they constitute highly bioavailable platforms. Their interactions with negatively charged species and biological membranes as well as their controllable cytotoxicity imparted their applications as anion receptors, but also a promising potential as antibacterial and anticancer agents whose mechanism of action can be observed using luminescence, opening the possibility of theranostics (therapy and diagnosis). One of the other assets of imidazolium salts is their flexible amphipathic character which promotes their self&#8208;organizations into liquid&#8208;crystal mesophases and their ability to mimic lipids. Combining luminescence to these amphipathic properties opens new prospects, e.&#8201;g., following gene or drug delivery inside cells. These salts, all&#8208;in&#8208;one, should lead to new tools for biologists, as well as active theranostic molecules.

         <dc:description>The rapid Pd0&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling of [11C]CH3I with carboxytriphenylsilane (1)&#160;to synthesize [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid ([11C]2)&#160;and its corresponding imidyl esters as radiolabeling reagents for&#160;11C&#8208;acetylation is reported. The reaction of [11C]CH3I with&#160;1  using a Pd2  (dibenzylideneacetone)3/P(o&#8208;tolyl)3  (1:4) catalyst in tetrahydrofuran/H2O (9:1) at 90&#160;&#176;C for 4&#160;min afforded [11C]2  having satisfactory radioactivity and a good yield. The coupling of the cationic carbon atom of methyl iodide and the carboxyl group in&#160;1  is an ionicity&#8208;driven reversed&#8208;polarity reaction. An injectable radiopharmaceutical formulation of [11C]2  prepared using 33 GBq of [11C]CH3I had a radioactivity of 7.4&#8211;7.8&#160;GBq, and the decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of [11C]CH3I into [11C]2  was 63&#8211;73%. [11C]2  was converted to [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid phthalimidyl ester ([11C]3)&#160;or its succinimidyl ester ([11C]10), which were used for the&#160;11C&#8208;acetylation of 4&#8208;aminophenol, oxytocin, and albumin.

         <title>Dual&#8208;State Emissive &#960;&#8208;Extended Salicylaldehyde Fluorophores: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and First&#8208;Principle Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for simple, low&#8208;cost, versatile, easily accessible, stimuli&#8208;responsive, highly emissive molecular fluorophores emitting both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state has prompted us to investigate the optical properties of a series of synthetically accessible salicylaldehyde derivatives possessing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety at their 4&#8208;position. These dyes are mainly known as synthetic intermediates but can also display sizeable Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) fluorescence owing to the presence of a 6&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonded ring in their structure. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been studied in solution (multiple solvents) and in the solid&#8208;state, as doped in PMMA films, KBr pellets or as powders leading to the observation of a pronounced fluorosolvatochromism.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The search for simple, low-cost, versatile, easily accessible, stimuli-responsive, highly emissive molecular fluorophores emitting both in solution and in the solid-state has prompted us to investigate the optical properties of a series of synthetically accessible salicylaldehyde derivatives possessing a &#960;-conjugated moiety at their 4-position. These dyes are mainly known as synthetic intermediates but can also display sizeable Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) fluorescence owing to the presence of a 6-membered H-bonded ring in their structure. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been studied in solution (multiple solvents) and in the solid-state, as doped in PMMA films, KBr pellets or as powders leading to the observation of a pronounced fluorosolvatochromism. Emission wavelengths in the range 400-654 nm, along with photoluminescence quantum yields up to 76% were recorded. Modification of the spacer (ethynyl, vinyl or direct connection) involved the &#960;-delocalization triggers major differences in terms of maximum emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yields in the various media studied. All photophysical observations are rationalized by first-principle calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaminoterephthalate&#8208;EDTA and &#8208;EGTA Conjugates &#8211; "Turn on"&#8208;Fluorescence Sensors for Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly effective "turn&#8208;on" fluorescence sensor with high selectivity for Zn2+  ions is reported. Its constitution simply consists of two units of the fluorescence dye diaminoterephthalate (DAT) and the chelate ligand EDTA. In total, four products (DAT)2EDTA and (DAT)2EGTA were prepared by conjugation of DATs with chelate ligands EDTA and EGTA as sensors for metal ions in solution. The fluorescence of all four compounds is strongly quenched by coordination of Cu2+  and Ni2+  ions. For one EDTA&#8208;derivative, the fluorescence quantum yield is increased by the factor of five with ten equivalents of ScCl3. For both EDTA derivatives, the fluorescence quantum yield increased by the factor of five with one equivalent Zn(OAc)2. Therefore, the (DAT)2EDTA structures define fluorescence sensors with a high selectivity for Zn2+  accompanied by a strong "turn&#8208;on" effect with Zn2+  ions. Furthermore, the coordination geometry of (DAT)2EDTA with Zn2+  was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis of the trinuclear complex [ZnCl2]{Zn(OH2)[(DAT)2EDTA &#8211; 2 H]}  2  &#8729;  6.5 H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

         <title>Electrochemical Induced Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Difunctionalization of Alkynes: The Synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Iodovinyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for electrochemical iodosulfonylation of alkynes was developed under oxidant&#8208;free condition. This procedure affords valuable &#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones with broad substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Moreover, this facile protocol can be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfone.







Abstract
An efficient, green, and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for alkyne difunctionalization was described. Using undivided electrochemical cell for iodosulfonylation of alkynes with commercially available iodide radical (NaI), arylsulfonyl radical (ArSO2NHNH2) sources, a variety of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones were obtained in one&#8208;pot with wide substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under mild and ecofriendly conditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphine Mediated Oxidative Phosphorylation of Aromatic Amines and P(OR)3 under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;phosphine system was developed to promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under aerobic conditions. Importantly, this method could be applied not only to the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates (C&#8722;P bonds) but also to produce phosphoramides (N&#8722;P bonds). This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;phosphine system (Cu(OAc)2 and t&#8208;Bu3P&#8901;HBF4) was used to synthesize &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under oxygen atmosphere. With this Cu&#8722;P system, &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates containing C&#8722;P bonds were generated from N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or N&#8208;methylanilines and trialkyl phosphites; phosphoramidates containing N&#8722;P bonds were produced from N&#8208;benzylanilines and trialkyl phosphites. This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds. The compounds containing phosphoryl group attracted extensive attention due to their biological activities and wide applications.[1,2] The &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates have been applied in medicine and agriculture such as anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antibacterial agents, and enzyme inhibitors.[1] And phosphoramides could be served as antibiotics, prodrugs, flame retardants, and ligands.[2]

         <title>Selective Nitration of Open&#8208;Cage [60]Fullerene Derivatives by Ponzio Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponzio reaction converts the oxime group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivatives into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, one of which acts as an effective stopper above the orifice.







Abstract
The carbonyl group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivative was converted into an oxime group when treated with hydroxylamine. Nitrogen tetroxide could convert the oxime group into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, similar to the Ponzio reaction of classical organic compounds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data shows that one of the nitro group is directly above the orifice acting as an effective stopper. Presence of the gem&#8208;dinitro groups also showed significant effect on the reactivity of other functional groups on the rim of the orifice.

     alt="Selective Nitration of Open-Cage [60]Fullerene Derivatives by Ponzio Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponzio reaction converts the oxime group on the rim of open-cage C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives into &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dinitro groups, one of which acts as an effective stopper above the orifice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbonyl group on the rim of open-cage C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; derivative was converted into an oxime group when treated with hydroxylamine. Nitrogen tetroxide could convert the oxime group into &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dinitro groups, similar to the Ponzio reaction of classical organic compounds. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data shows that one of the nitro group is directly above the orifice acting as an effective stopper. Presence of the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dinitro groups also showed significant effect on the reactivity of other functional groups on the rim of the orifice.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization through ozonolysis and cyclization with reductive amination of various readily available cycloalkenes.







Abstract
An improved, efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization of various readily available cyclic compounds containing ring C=C bond. The stereocontrolled synthetic concept was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of various unsaturated scaffolds across ozonolysis followed by ring closing with double reductive amination with primary alkylamines or fluorinated alkylamines. The protocol provided versatile azaheterocyclic derivatives with a piperidine or azepane framework.

         <title>Synthesis of Trinuclear Benzimidazole&#8208;Fused Hybrid Scaffolds by Transition Metal&#8208;Free Tandem C(sp2)&#8722;N Bond Formation under Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of trinuclear N&#8208;fused hybrid scaffolds was constructed by transition metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling and cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208; or 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aryloxybenzimidazoles under microwave irradiation.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Bromoaryl)&#8208; and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles have been coupled and cyclized with 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 2&#8208;aryloxybenzimidazoles as building blocks in the presence of a base under microwave irradiation to give a class of trinuclear N&#8208;fused hybrid scaffolds, benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines and &#8208;pyrimidines, respectively, in good yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Bromoaryl)&#8208; and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)imidazoles also reacted with 2&#8208;methoxybenzimidazoles in the presence of base under microwave irradiation to give a class of trinuclear N&#8208;fused hybrid scaffolds, benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]imidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines and &#8208;pyrimidines, respectively, in similar yields. This process seems to proceed via an initial C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling by an addition&#8208;elimination nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and subsequent cyclization accompanied by extrusion of alcohols.

         <dc:description>We have developed a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated synthetic method to directly cleave stable amide C&#8211;N bonds by a variety of alcohol and amine nucleophiles. Reverse reactivity was observed and alcoholysis of amides by activated primary and secondary benzylic, and propargylic alcohols have been achieved instead of the expected nucleophilic substitution of alcohols. As an application, 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazole derivatives have been synthesized in one pot employing 2&#8208;aminothiophenol as nucleophile.</dc:description>

Oxygenated and nitrogenated substituents at the C4 position on the quinoline ring were shown to reinforce the Si-N1 interaction through a p-&#960; conjugation. The Lewis acidity of this class of silylium was finally determined using M&#252;ller&#8217;s nitrilium method&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Di&#8208; and trifluorinated 2&#8208;azidobenzimidazole derivatives: synthesis, photooxygenation, and 19F NMR prediction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoreactivity of a series of hitherto unknown, multiply fluorinated 2&#8208;azidobenzimidazole derivatives was investigated. The synthesis of the starting material includes regioselective  p  &#8208;defluorination of nitrobenzene derivatives employing Ogoshi's conditions. If the 6&#8208;position was unsubstituted, irradiation in the presence of N&#8208;protected amino acids at 300&#160;nm (Rayonet) led to the formation of arylesters by oxygenation of the 6&#8208;position in good to excellent yields and perfect regioselectivity. We did not observe any displacement of fluoride. If the 6&#8208;position itself was fluorinated, alternative positions of the benzene portion were attacked. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via ring opening of the singlet nitrene to the cyanodiimine or via the iminobenzimidazolium ion. The availability of a set of fluorinated photoadducts prompted the quantum chemical calculation of their  19  F NMR chemical shifts. Even with the most suitable method investigated (&#969;B97XD/TApr&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ), deviations of up to 5 ppm from the experimental values were observed, underlining the importance of experimental measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Aziridines Via Asymmetric Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first organocatalytic method for the desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;aziridines that does not require the use of an external nucleophilic reagent. The process was designed upon a base promoted rearrangement of bicyclic  meso  &#8208;cyclopentanone aziridines, that progresses in intramolecular fashion to provide densely functionalized cyclic ketones, key intermediates for the preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. The key enantio&#8208;determining step proceeded under the catalysis of a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst. The process provides an entry to a class of highly functionalized chiral amines, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones, not accessible with previous desymmetrization methods. The ambiphilic nature of the products makes them versatile synthetic intermediates in the preparation of natural products and popular antiviral nucleoside inhibitors, for example abacavir.</dc:description>

Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Intermolecular Photoredox Coupling: Alternative to Norrish Type II Reaction and Yang Cyclization in Ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction pathway of the photoconversion of butyrophenone is reported. In addition to the Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization, intermolecular species are generated: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane, 2&#8208;phenacylacetonitrile and pinacols. They account for approx. 20&#8201;% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The acetophenone enol intermediate has been identified as an H&#8208;atom donor for the proposed mechanistic steps.







Abstract
A new reaction pathway for the photoconversion of butyrophenone in acetonitrile was investigated. In addition to the classic intramolecular photoreactivity of ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds (Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization), intermolecular generated species were isolated and characterized: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane, 2&#8208;phenacylacetonitrile (oxidized species) and pinacols (reduced species). They account for approx. 20&#8201;% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The acetophenone enol intermediate, formed in&#8197;situ via the Norrish type II reaction, has been identified as an H&#8208;atom donor for the main intermolecular reaction steps, and has been distinguished from other conceivable mechanistic possibilities. Experimental results with analogue compounds suggest that the intermolecular product formation pathway may be of general relevance.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free and Oxidant&#8208;Free Radical Cyclization of (2&#8208;Isocyanoaryl)(methyl)sulfanes with Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible light&#8208;induced oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanoaryl thioethers with ethers has been established, which provides an expeditious approach to access ether&#8208;functionalized benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields. The obtained products combine benzothiazole with ether and represent key structural motifs of a large of biologically active molecules in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A novel cascade cyclization of (2&#8208;isocyanoaryl) (methyl)sulfanes and ethers is developed. With 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and the irradiation of blue LED light, ether radicals are efficiently generated without adding any oxidant, endowing the strategy with features of oxidant&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity. This strategy provides efficient approach to access various ether&#8208;containing benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Dehydrocostus Lactone by Domino Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient total synthesis of the sesquiterpenoid (&#8722;)&#8208;dehydrocostus lactone is reported. Our earlier approach by a domino enediyne metathesis was extended by a domino dienyne metathesis strategy to give access to suitably functionalized hydroazulene cores. Highly stereoselective asymmetric anti aldol reactions provided the enantiopure substrates for this key step of our synthesis. Multiple hydroboration/oxidation of the resulting hydroazulenes set up three out of four stereogenic centers in a single step. First, oxidation to give a diketo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone enabled an enantioselective formal synthesis of the target guaianolide. Subsequently, the final steps of this approach were improved by using a double carbonyl olefination at the stage of a masked &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, which completed the synthesis in a much more efficient way.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

An approach for the preparation of polysustituted furans through a metal&#8208;free base&#8208;catalyzed oxacyclization of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols is described. With this approach 32 new compounds were obtained. Furthermore, natural population analysis by DFT calculations, highlighted experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran.







Abstract
An efficient base catalyzed oxacyclization of Z&#8208;enynols has been developed under transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, thus resulting in a variety of new di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. This approach allowed us to obtain 32 new compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were realized to depict a relationship between the natural population analysis and experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran. A one&#8208;pot Sonogashira/oxacyclization approach offers a flexible, robust and efficient alternative to base catalyzed cyclization is also carried out.

         <dc:description>Capuramycin is an important lead nucleoside antibiotic for the development of new therapeutic agents against the multidrug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Due to the poor accessibilities, the heterogeneous issues and difficulties in the modification of capuramycin at the specific positions, in&#8208;depth studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR) of capuramycin are hampered. Chemical synthesis is a reliable and effective method to provide the capuramycin and analogues. Thus far, only four different synthetic routes toward capuramycin have been reported.

         <title>Recent developments in enantioselective organocatalytic cascade reactions for the construction of halogenated ring systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral halogenated substances have many applications in pharmaceuticals, in agrochemicals, in materials, including polymers and liquid crystals and as intermediates in synthesis. The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule can have a large effect in its properties, and halogens are used in drugs to improve lipophlicity, membrane permeability and absorption, and even the blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability. As highlighted in this review, there are nowadays a range of highly selective, versatile halogenating reagents, electrophilic, nucleophilic or radical in nature, which operate under mild conditions, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules in cascade reactions. Recent developments in organocatalyst design revealed novel Cinchona alkaloids derivatives, chiral phosphoric acids, amines, phosphines and several bifunctional catalysts, mostly thiourea&#8208; or squaramide&#8208;based, which introduced chirality, with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselection, in the formation of one or multiple chiral centres in a single synthetic operation, as shown. In this review we survey the literature published in this field from 2014 to 2020.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures of Tetramesityl&#8208;substituted Tetracyclopenta[def,jkl,pqr,vwx]tetraphenylnene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal structures of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopenta[  def,jkl,pqr,vwx  ]tetraphenylnene (TCPTP) derivative were determined for crystals containing different solvents, CHCl  3  , CD  2  Cl  2  , acetone, and benzene at different temperatures to discuss the conjugation modes in the antiaromatic system, i.e., whether it adopts a  D  2  h  structure consisting of local aromatic sextets and &#160;quinodimethane substructures or a  D  4  h  double annulenenoid structure. The structures of the TCPTP core in all crystals determined at 113 K or 73 K resemble those of the theoretical  D  2  h  geometry, whereas the bond lengths at room temperature (293 K) adopt averaged values of the theoretical  D  2  h  and  D  4  h  geometries. These results are interpreted in terms of disorder of two perpendicularly oriented  D  2  h  structures at room temperature and support the theoretical prediction which favours the  D  2  h  geometry. The slightly different bond length distributions in the crystals are ascribed to the different space in the vicinity of the molecule which allows the molecule to adopt the two orientations in different occupancies.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Catalyzed Cyclization of Bis(enones): A Viable Approach to the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclopentane Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor.







Abstract
Photoredox catalytic cyclization of aryl enones in the presence of visible light, promoted either by metals or organic dyes, represent a valuable strategy for the synthesis of cycloalkanes. The development of a stereoselective version of such transformation, in the presence of the metal&#8208;free catalyst Eosin Y was studied, with the aim to realize an efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings, taking advantage of the flow reactors technology. The use of a chiral auxiliary on the bisenone to be cyclized offers a straightforward and convenient option to exert a stereocontrol on the light&#8208;driven cyclization. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, a functionalized 1,2&#8208;trans cyclopentane ring in up to 83/17 enantiomeric ratio. When the reaction was performed in continuo, in a homemade coil photoreactor, high yields were observed. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor, without any change in the diastereoseletctivity of the process.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient protocol for the in-flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light-driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D-printed mesoreactor.

         <title>Recent Advances in Direct C&#8208;H Radical Alkylation of 1,4&#8208;Quinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Quinones display unique redox and biological properties and have multiple applications in a wide array of fields, including health. Synthesis of diversely&#8208;substituted quinone&#8208;based compounds remains difficult and usually consists of multiple step sequences. Interest in direct C&#8208;H radical alkylation of 1,4&#8208;quinones has thus continuously grown over this last decade. These reactions involve addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated from radical precursors through decarboxylative alkylation, hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction, or by carbon&#8208;halogen bond reduction. Recent progresses in radical chemistry, including photoredox catalysis, have provided useful tools for quinone functionalization. This review describes the recent progress with these methodologies, including the new promising three&#8208;component cascade reactions involving quinones and alkenes, allowing the preparation of complex substituted 1,4&#8208;quinones in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and biophysical approaches to allosteric modulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric regulation, i.e. the control exerted on an orthosteric site by an effector interacting at a distinct and distant site, represents a prime example of a precise tuning system of several key biological processes like gene transcription, cell adhesion and, most importantly, signal transduction. Since its discovery sixty years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been extensively investigated. The aim of this minireview is to introduce the reader to the topic of protein allostery. In particular, we briefly overview the allosteric models postulated over the years and we describe the most relevant chemical and biophysical approaches reported so far for the identification of putative allosteric sites and/or for the investigation of allosteric signal propagation throughout the protein. An outlook of the main computational and experimental methods is followed by four case studies representative of different proteins classes: enzymes, hub proteins, cell receptors and intrinsically disordered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of the Triazolium Ion&#8208; Catalyzed Intramolecular Stetter Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt3/NEt3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first order in catalyst and zero order in aldehyde.

Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt3/NEt3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first&#8208;order in catalyst and zero&#8208;order in aldehyde over a broad range of aldehyde concentrations. The observed reaction rate is higher for catalysts bearing N&#8208;aryl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. A concurrent, NHC&#8208;independent substrate isomerization was also observed and found to demonstrate a first&#8208;order dependence on aldehyde concentration. The reported data are consistent with deprotonation to form the Breslow intermediate being turnover&#8208;limiting in this process.

The wide variety of heterocycles that can be prepared using these precursors, together with the high regioselectivity they usually provide in type [3+2] and [3+3] cyclocondensation reactions, makes these powerful starting materials one may have in hand. The biological evaluation is also highlighted, given that several analogues of commercially available drugs can be easily accessed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. The left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, has been synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity.

In this study, the left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, was synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity. This stereoselectivity was investigated by computational studies. Further selective transformation provided a tricyclic skeleton with the desired stereochemistry.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation on Modified Analogues of an Argininocalixarene Based Non&#8208;viral Gene Vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of eight novel calix[4]arene&#8208;cone amphiphiles bearing different types and numbers of cationic headgroups at the upper rim and different alkyl chains at the lower rim were synthesized and studied in pDNA binding and cell transfection in order to dissect the role of each of these structural elements on gene delivery properties of this promising class of non&#8208;viral vectors.







Abstract
The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene 1 has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different types of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by negligible toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, and v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg, might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into the cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carboborylation for the Synthesis of Borylated Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interception of &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;palladium complexes in catalysis is a powerful strategy for the generation of molecular complexity. We have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes, which proceeds in good yields and moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reaction were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and chiral deep eutectic solvents (CDESs) in asymmetric organocatalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this minireview we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Protosilylation/Protoborylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroallenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective protosilylation and protoborylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford tertiary and secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallyl compounds have been developed. The reactions proceed under very mild reaction conditions and provided the corresponding products in high efficiency.







Abstract
We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford gem&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. It is different from non&#8208;fluorine allenes in which nucleophiles are added to &#947;&#8208;position of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;addition products. Not only monosubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes but also disubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes could react well with silaboronate (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The protocol is simple and efficient to construct compounds which contain tertiary/secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. Moreover, diverse organofluorine compounds can be converted from these organoboronates and silanes.

         <title>Study of Rhodamine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Organic Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives were used as fluorescent probes in the detection and real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates in different solvents. Mechanism studies reveal a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring with the presence or absence of radicals.







Abstract
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives for the detection of radical intermediates in organic reactions were synthesized and used as fluorescent probes over a wide range of solvents. The mechanistic studies confirm a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring. Compound 21 can be used to support the radical mechanism or in the real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Methyl 2&#8208;Oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;based methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) has been oxidized to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Densely functionalized methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate is stable at low temperatures but slowly dimerizes by a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Accordingly, methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been developed as a new dienophile in the classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes







Abstract
Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by the addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6a,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Heterabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl Trifluoroborates</title>

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
