         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Benzotriazoles via [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azides and Arynes in Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzotriazoles in flow is reported. Using azides and in situ generated arynes, benzotriazoles are formed in a [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Employing different substitution patterns of the azide and aryne coupling partners, a modular access to benzotriazoles is provided. Thermal strain of hazardous azides and accumulation of reactive intermediates is minimized by short reaction times in flow, improving the safety profile of the process. The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of &#948;&#8208;Lactones by Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Enol Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#948;&#8208;Valerolactone derivatives are formed by cerium&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic coupling of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with enol acetates and dioxygen. The products possess a 1,4&#8208;diketone moiety, thus, the conversion can be regarded as an Umpolung since the &#946;&#8208;oxoesters are oxidized to electrophilic &#945;&#8208;radicals. The transformation has similarities to the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation (BVO) where the higher substituted residue migrates. An endoperoxidic oxycarbenium ion comparable to the Criegee intermediate in the BVO is proposed as a reaction intermediate in this case of oxidative C&#8208;C coupling reaction, but in contrast to the BVO, the less substituted alkyl residue migrates. It was demonstrated by conversion of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with two stereocenters that this 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift proceeds with retention of configuration. A radical chain mechanism of the coupling reaction was furthermore evidenced by conversion of enol acetates and &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with cyclopropyl substituents. Isolation and characterization of products with opened cyclopropane rings established the constitution of radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoline ligands improve the classic direct C&#8211;H functionalisation/intramolecular cyclisation of diaryl ethers to dibenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;H functionalisation approach to the synthesis of dibenzofurans is hampered by a number of problems. Herein we describe the evolution of a cheap, bench stable quinoline ligand, which obviates most of the current limitations and allows for a high yielding synthesis of a range of valuable dibenzofurans. Dibenzofurans are important motifs in natural products and compounds with wide biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Oxabicyclic Pyrrolidines of Medicinal Relevance: Merging Chemoenzymatic and Catalytic Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of chemical and chemoenzymatic steps lead to an enantiopure oxabicyclic pyrrolidine ketone which can be functionalized with Grignard reagents to provide core units for medicinally relevant compounds.







Abstract
Two approaches to the synthesis of an oxabicyclic pyrrolidine&#8208;6&#8208;one are described using enzymatic resolution and gold&#8208;mediated catalysis as key steps toward enantiopure compounds previously reported as racemic mixtures. Addition of Grignard reagents to the ketone afforded a variety of diversified tertiary alcohols of interest for their reported pharmacological activities.

         <title>A Novel Approach to N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;Dihydroquinolin&#8208; 4(1H)&#8208;ones via a Ligand&#8208;Free Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aza&#8208;Michael Cyclization</title>

The one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation of ketone and sequential aza&#8208;Micahel addition was developed, which provides N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to good yields. This catalytic reaction provides simple and mild reaction conditions, a wide scope of substrates to biologically interesting N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones have recently been identified as important structures with potent biological activities such as antitumor and antidiabetic effect. Herein, a total of 25 novel N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones were expediently synthesized via the oxidative aza&#8208;Michael cyclization of N&#8208;Tf&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;aminodihydrochalcones by ligand&#8208;free palladium(II) catalysis. This study presents a new synthetic approach to yield N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones, which can be easily transformed into pharmacologically interesting aza&#8208;flavanones and other N&#8208;heterocycles, such as quinolines and tetrahydroquinolines, in yields up to 84&#8201;%. This methodology has various advantages, which includes short reaction times under mild conditions and suitable functional group tolerance. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism was proposed and demonstrated by kinetic analysis.

         <title>Diversified Syntheses of Tetrathia[7]helicenes by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly versatile procedures have been developed for the synthesis of functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, including benzo fused systems, through transition metal&#8208;promoted annulation reactions of bis(benzodithiophene) species, obtained from 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene as key intermediate.







Abstract
Efficient and versatile synthetic routes to functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes (7&#8208;THs) are described. The key intermediates of these methodologies are 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (1), synthesized through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homocoupling reaction between two benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene units followed by a regioselective &#945;&#8208;bromination. Direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of bromides 1 with internal alkynes provides a set of 7,8&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;THs 2 in moderate to good yields (46&#8208;80&#8201;%). Otherwise, 7&#8208;monosubstituted 7&#8208;THs 4 have been prepared through Sonogashira coupling of 1 with terminal alkynes, followed by platinum&#8208; or indium&#8208;promoted cycloisomerization of alkynyl intermediates 6. Finally, the versatility of bromides 1 has also been demonstrated by using them for the preparation of benzo (hetero) fused 7&#8208;TH derivatives 7 via Suzuki coupling with (hetero)arylboronic acids and the photocyclization of the obtained intermediates 9.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient and versatile synthetic routes to functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes (7&#8208;THs) are described. The key intermediates of these methodologies are 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:4,3&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophenes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), synthesized through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homocoupling reaction between two benzo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:4,3&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]dithiophene units followed by a regioselective &#945;&#8208;bromination. Direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of bromides &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with internal alkynes provides a set of 7,8&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;THs &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in moderate to good yields (46&#8208;80&#8201;%). Otherwise, 7&#8208;monosubstituted 7&#8208;THs &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; have been prepared through Sonogashira coupling of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with terminal alkynes, followed by platinum&#8208; or indium&#8208;promoted cycloisomerization of alkynyl intermediates &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. Finally, the versatility of bromides &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has also been demonstrated by using them for the preparation of benzo (hetero) fused 7&#8208;TH derivatives &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; via Suzuki coupling with (hetero)arylboronic acids and the photocyclization of the obtained intermediates &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A New Phenanthroline Ligand and the Spontaneous Resolution of its Homoleptic Copper(I) Complex</title>

A benzyl substituent was regioselectively introduced at the 7 position after a first substitution at the 2 position of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, by using aryl&#8208;lithio reagents generated with tert&#8208;butyllithium in toluene. Among the complexes prepared (Pd(II), Cu(I)) with these new ligands, a chiral copper(I) complex exhibits spontaneous resolution in the solid state.






During the synthesis of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives sterically hindered in the 2 and/or 9 positions, serendipity led to the discovery of a new substitution pattern on phenanthroline with good and reproducible yields. When toluene was used as a solvent and the aryl&#8208;lithio reagents generated with tBuLi, after a first substitution at the 2 position, a benzyl substituent was regioselectively introduced at the 7 position. It is proposed that the benzyllithium reagent is formed by reaction with the solvent and that the steric hindrance on the intermediates controls the nucleophilic addition. Among the complexes prepared (Pd(II), Cu(I)) with these new ligands, a chiral copper(I) complex exhibits spontaneous resolution in the solid state.

The synthesis of four&#8208;armed water soluble phthalocyanine derivative, that was conjugated to chitosan through carbodiimide&#8208;mediated amine coupling reaction, resulting in the formation of photoactive hydrogel in described.






Hydrogels are attractive materials for many biomedical applications, including drug delivery and wound healing. A light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity can be conferred to the material with the introduction of appropriate photosensitizers (PS). In this study, we have synthesized water&#8208;soluble silicon(IV)phthalocyanine derivative (SiPc) that contains four carboxylic groups on the periphery of the macrocycle. Obtained PS serves not only as an active chromophore but also as a cross&#8208;linking gelator, enabling simple and easy synthesis of chitosan conjugate (SiPcCh). Although UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic methods showed that both free and conjugated PS are non&#8208;aggregated in water media, only SiPcCh possess remarkable antibacterial effect against Gram&#8208;positive B. subtilis and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.

         <title>8&#8208;Prenylflavanones through Microwave Promoted Tandem Claisen Rearrangement/6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig Cyclization and Cross Metathesis</title>

Microwave irradiation of ortho&#8208;allyloxy chalcones promotes a tandem sequence of Claisen rearrangement and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig&#8208;cyclization. Olefin cross metathesis then furnishes prenylated flavonoids. The method has, inter alia, been applied to the synthesis of an angular chromene&#8208;annellated natural product and its linear isomer. Both occur in medicinal plants indigenous in India and Nigeria respectively.






Prenylated flavanones were obtained from ortho&#8208;allyloxy chalcones through a one&#8208;pot sequence of Claisen rearrangement and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, followed by olefin cross metathesis of the intermediate allyl flavanones with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene. The synthetic utility of this route is illustrated for the synthesis of several naturally occurring prenyl flavanones.

         <title>Multivalent 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Linked Carbohydrate Mimetics by Huisgen&#8211;Meldal&#8208;Sharpless Cycloadditions of an Azidopyran</title>

An azidopyran was coupled through a CuAAC reaction with oligoalkynes to provide multivalent carbohydrate mimetics with flexible or rigid core elements. Preliminary SPR measurements indicate that an O&#8208;sulfated C60&#8208;derived dodecavalent compound may be an excellent ligand of L&#8208; and P&#8208;selectins (IC50 values in low nM range).






Starting from an enantiopure 3&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted pyran derivative and various oligo&#8208;alkynes a series of multivalent 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked carbohydrate mimetics was synthesized. The copper&#8208;catalyzed Huisgen&#8211;Meldal&#8208;Sharpless cycloaddition (CuAAC) served as key coupling reaction. Cu/C in the presence of triethylamine proved to be a good catalytic system in most cases. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, and octavalent compounds with typical rigid or flexible core units were prepared. The most complex compound contains a C60&#8208;fullerene center leading to a dodecavalent carbohydrate mimetic. Only a few of the multivalent target compounds could be converted into pure O&#8208;sulfated derivatives that are required for their evaluation as L&#8208; and P&#8208;selectin ligands. Nevertheless, preliminary experiments suggest that the dodecavalent C60&#8208;derived compound may be a promising ligand of these biologically important proteins with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization of Olefins Catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7304-7319, December 20, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles is a powerful method to synthesize highly valuable allylic functionalized molecules in a highly regioselective manner. This present review describes the recent advancements in allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.






Olefins are widely available feedstocks and can be readily functionalized into complex organic molecules. In particular, the regioselective allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins can provide highly valuable allylic functionalized organic molecules in a highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner. This present review describes the recent advancement on allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes. This review covers the advancement in the allylic C&#8211;H amination, arylation and etherification of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.

&lt;p&gt;The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles is a powerful method to synthesize highly valuable allylic functionalized molecules in a highly regioselective manner. This present review describes the recent advancements in allylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olefins are widely available feedstocks and can be readily functionalized into complex organic molecules. In particular, the regioselective allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins can provide highly valuable allylic functionalized organic molecules in a highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner. This present review describes the recent advancement on allylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes. This review covers the advancement in the allylic C&#8211;H amination, arylation and etherification of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7254-7283, December 20, 2020. </description>

Integration of distinct mechanically active components is a promising approach to build molecular machines that perform useful tasks. A key concern in the design stage is the strict stimuli&#8208;orthogonality for selective operation of the individual components. Herein, notable examples of molecular switches and motors powered by different stimuli to show multiple dynamic features are surveyed.






Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Aryl Selenides and Tellurides via Visible Light&#8208;Driven Activation of Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7358-7367, December 20, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical (hetero)aryl selenides and tellurides have been prepared in satisfactory yields from arylazo sulfones under visible light driven, photocatalyst&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions.






A protocol for the visible light driven preparation of unsymmetrical (hetero)aryl selenides and tellurides is described herein. The method exploits the peculiar photoreactivity of arylazo sulfones that act as thermally stable, precursors of aryl radicals under both photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The method developed shows an impressive versatility (more than fifty compounds isolated).

The Front Cover shows a conceptual illustration of molecular systems that can be activated by orthogonal stimuli to show multimodal movement. Integration of distinct mechanically active components would be a promising strategy to design molecular machines capable of executing sophisticated tasks. However, a key consideration is how to ensure selective operation of the individual components. In this regard, a variety of ingenious examples of molecular switches and motors powered by different stimuli to exhibit multiple dynamic features have been reported.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Controlled Reductive Amination Reactions with NaBH4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7368-7372, December 20, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NaBH4 was controlled by atmospheric CO2, thus suppressing direct reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. High selectivities towards reductive amination alkylation reactions indicate the in&#8208;situ formation of less reducing NaBH(OCHO)3. This protocol provides a surrogate for conventional reducing reagents in reductive amination reactions.






We report the use of CO2 to curb the reactivity of NaBH4 enabling its use in reductive amination reactions. CO2 readily reacts with NaBH4 to decrease its capacity to reduce aldehydes to alcohols while remaining able to reduce imines and iminium ions for desired alkylation reactions. The formation of NaBH(OCHO)3 as a reducing reagent was critical to achieve the desired selectivity. A general protocol was established for C&#8211;N bond formation reactions and replacing NaBH4 with NaBD4 allowed for reductive amination with concomitant deuteration to be carried out.

&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was controlled by atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus suppressing direct reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. High selectivities towards reductive amination alkylation reactions indicate the in&#8208;situ formation of less reducing NaBH(OCHO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This protocol provides a surrogate for conventional reducing reagents in reductive amination reactions.

         <title>Cover Feature: A New Phenanthroline Ligand and the Spontaneous Resolution of its Homoleptic Copper(I) Complex (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 47/2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7253-7253, December 20, 2020. </description>

The Cover Feature shows a new substitution pattern obtained when reacting phenanthrolines with organolithium compounds. Contrary to the now classical 2,9&#8208;disubstitution described in the seminal paper of Christiane Dietrich&#8208;Buchecker et al., to whom this article is dedicated, a 2,7&#8208;disubstitution pattern was found by chance under given conditions. A rare spontaneous resolution of its bis(phenanthroline)copper(I) complex in the solid state is also described in the article. (cover picture created by Nina Hernandez). More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Ruppert et al.

         <title>Endocyclic Enamides Derived from Aza&#8208;Diketopiperazines as Olefin Partners in Povarov Reaction: An Access to Tetracyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 47, Page 7385-7395, December 20, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endocyclic enamide having a unique bicyclic structure including a 1,2,4&#8208;triazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dione subunit was used as an olefin partner in the Povarov reaction. This represents an efficient strategy to access a new family of fused tetracyclic N&#8208;heterocycles which combine in their structure two scaffolds of interest in medicinal chemistry, a tetrahydroquinoline (THQ and an aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP).






Original endocyclic enamides based on a bicyclic aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP) structure have been used as dienophile partners in the Povarov reaction. The reported method represents a successful strategy for the structural diversification of the aza&#8208;DKP scaffold, giving access to a new family of fused tetracyclic N&#8208;heterocycles, which contain at least four nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure. Depending on the nature of the aldehyde partner, the cycloadditions have been performed either as a two&#8208;component or a three&#8208;component Povarov reaction (2CPR or 3CPR), in the presence of BF3 as a Lewis acid catalyst. With aliphatic aldehydes the reaction proceeds with high diastereoselectivities in favor of the cis compounds. Some mechanistic aspects of this cycloaddition have been examined computationally.

While some are standard reactions, other are more complex transformations, such as the Brook rearrangement and its variants. This carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen silyl migration represents a privileged method to generate transient carbanionic species well suited to undergo functionalization upon electrophilic substitution in the presence of an electrophile. This minireview focuses on recent advances in C(sp  2  )&#8211;Si bond functionalization through intramolecular activation by alkoxides. The key elements of reactivity will be highlighted in the introduction to allow the proper understanding of the migration process.

         <title>Five&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles Synthesis through 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Non&#8208;Stabilized Azomethine Ylides with 2&#8208;Pyridone Heteroaromatic Systems as Dipolarophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly efficient 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylides with diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridone systems, bearing two potential C=C dipolarophilic sites was reported. The TFA&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions involving the in&#8197;situ prepared electron&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;dipole are studied according to the nature of pyridone substituents. These reactions occur in mild conditions, good yields, and show a full control of the regioselectivity.







Abstract
We report an efficient 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition involving non&#8208;stabilized electron&#8208;rich azomethine ylides and diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridones bearing two potential C=C dipolarophilic sites. The 1,3&#8208;dipoles were prepared in&#8197;situ under TFA catalysis and cycloadditions were studied according to the nature of the pyridones and position of the various substituents. These reactions occur under mild conditions, and lead to the expected cycloadducts in good yields and full control of the regioselectivity. Furthermore, mono&#8208; or biscycloadditions were performed, leading to the formation of polycyclic scaffolds bearing biologically relevant pyrrolidine rings, prevalent in natural products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an efficient 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition involving non&#8208;stabilized electron&#8208;rich azomethine ylides and diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridones bearing two potential C=C dipolarophilic sites. The 1,3&#8208;dipoles were prepared &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; under TFA catalysis and cycloadditions were studied according to the nature of the pyridones and position of the various substituents. These reactions occur under mild conditions, and lead to the expected cycloadducts in good yields and full control of the regioselectivity. Furthermore, mono&#8208; or biscycloadditions were performed, leading to the formation of polycyclic scaffolds bearing biologically relevant pyrrolidine rings, prevalent in natural products. The diastereoselectivity of the second cycloaddition was fully controlled by the first addition, leading to heterocycles with a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; relative stereochemistry of the two generated rings in the final tricyclo&#8208;adduct.&lt;/p&gt;

New regioregular electropolymers have been obtained from donor&#8208;acceptor spiro&#8208;configured monomers with a 4,4&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene] core. The effects of the substitution arrangement of the monomers on their electrooptic properties as well as on their electropolymerization capacity and the electrooptic and morphological characteristics of the polymeric films obtained have been highlighted.







Abstract
A series of conjugation extended push&#8208;pull derivatives of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene] were synthesized and fully characterized, in which each perpendicularly aligned cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene features a pendant dicyanovinylene as an electron acceptor and a thiophene as an electron donor. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the new molecules, which differ from each other for the presence and/or location of an additional n&#8208;hexyl chain on the pendant thiophene unit, were investigated, as well as their susceptibility to electrochemical polymerization. The substitution arrangement of the monomers was found to exert significant influence on the outcome of the electropolymerization process and on the optoelectronic properties and morphological film characteristics of the new regioregular materials obtained.

         <title>Mechanochemistry as a Sustainable Method for the Preparation of Fluorescent Ugi BODIPY Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry enables a clean, sustainable and ready access to multicomponent reaction (Ugi) adducts based on BODIPY dyes as fluorescent label. Their fluorescence response depends on the conformational freedom around the key meso position. These functionalized dyes behave as fluorescent probes, being able to stain efficiently Candida albican cells, as well as visualize phagocytosis in its early and late steps.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, that is, the use of mechanical energy produced by milling or grinding to perform chemical transformations, was used as a green strategy using a minimal amount of solvent for the preparation of highly valuable formyl functionalized BODIPY dyes. The electronic properties of the meso&#8208;aryl group play a key role in the fluorescence response of the adducts resulting from the Ugi reaction. Such an understanding of the molecular structure&#8208;fluorescence interplay explains the brightness of these dyes in the cellular media monitored by fluorescence imaging. In the present report, we provide flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy evidence that the novel dyes efficiently stain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Candida albicans cells without disturbing cell integrity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by staining C. albicans cells, we can monitor the early and late steps of phagocytosis, using human monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages. The dye series presented herein represent a novel application for formyl functionalized BODIPYs, expanding their applications in monitoring biological processes.

         <title>SNAr Reaction Toward the Synthesis of Fluorinated Quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular SNAr displacement reaction of an o&#8208;fluorine atom on a meso&#8208;pentafluorophenyl group by the &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;group in meso&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;metalloporphyrin (M=Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II)) provides a novel pathway toward quinoline&#8208;annulated metalloporphyrins. The corresponding free base chromophore is available by demetallation.







Abstract
An intramolecular SNAr displacement of one o&#8208;fluorine atom of a meso&#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin metal complex by a neighboring &#946;&#8208;amino functionality generated the corresponding meso&#8208;fluorophenyl&#8208;substituted metallo&#8208;quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrins that are not accessible using established quinoline&#8208;annulation methodologies. The Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) complexes were thus prepared. The parent free base quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrin is accessible only by demetallation of the copper or zinc complexes. A strong through&#8208;space NMR&#8208;spectroscopic coupling between the remaining o&#8208;fluorine atoms on the annulated meso&#8208;aryl group and the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom on the adjacent pyrrole moiety provide a clear spectroscopic signature for the annulation. Quinoline&#8208;annulation alters the optical properties significantly. On account of the presence of the &#946;&#8208;amino functionality, all quinoline&#8208;annulated porphyrins show strong halochromic responses with Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, the prerequisite for their potential use in chemosensing applications.

         <dc:description>The title nonplanar electron acceptor ( 1 ) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue ( 2 ) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of 1 , 2 , and their CT crystals revealed that the Se &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N contact in 2 competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8208;H &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N hydrogen bond. The stronger ChB involving Se is the key for 1 to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN (&gt;97 wt%) from a complex isomer mixture containing ca. 10 wt% each of 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN by a simple, efficient and straightforward mixing&#8208;filtration&#8208;heating process.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclic epicatechin trimer with  C3  symmetry, connected through C&#8211;C bonds between A&#8208; and B&#8208;rings, was isolated as an oxidative coupling product of (&#8722;)&#8208;epicatechin with polyphenol oxidase. It was previously isolated as an oxidation product of epicatechin with CuCl2; however, only the 2D structure was proposed. Its stereochemistry was assigned using various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, and theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. It was suggested that the less strained cyclic trimer with the (aR,aR  ,aR) configuration was formed atroposelectively in the cyclization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Benzimidazoles from Diamines and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, facile, mild, and metal&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of benzimidazoles by cyclization of diamines and aldehydes was developed, using cheap household lamps as the light source and an organic molecule as the photoinitiator.







Abstract
An efficient, green, cheap, and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the synthesis of benzimidazoles has been developed. 2,2&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone was employed as the photoinitiator and CFL lamps were used as the light source, leading to the cyclization of substituted diamines with aldehydes. The corresponding benzimidazoles were obtained in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies were conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.

A direct and catalytic method for the regioselective introduction of the medicinally interesting &#8722;CF3 group into fused imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]&#8208;N&#8208;heteroarenes via an oxidative copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reaction has been developed. The reaction proceeds at room temperature using the cheap and stable Langlois reagent (NaSO2CF3) as a CF3 source.







Abstract
A simple, mild, and efficient oxidative copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]&#8208;N&#8208;heteroarenes have been developed using Langlois, (NaSO2CF3) reagent as CF3 source. This method gives biologically relevant trifluoromethylated fused imidazoles in moderate to good yields with good functional group tolerance. The key features of the reaction are mild conditions, short reaction time, and room temperature reaction.

         <title>Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Optical Properties of 2,18&#8208;Dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene</title>

A simple and efficient approach to synthesize a functionalized 2,18&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9] helicene is reported. It was synthesized from simple phenol building blocks using two subsequent reactions namely oxidative coupling and dehydrative cyclization or palladium mediated cyclization.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and efficient approach to synthesize a functionalized 2,18&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene. It was synthesized from simple phenol building blocks using two subsequent reactions namely oxidative coupling and dehydrative cyclization or palladium mediated cyclization. The molecular integrity of the helical core was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR techniques. Its crystal structure showed the spontaneous resolution which was attributed to the conglomerate formation of the same helical isomer via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; or H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Then, it was converted to racemic 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene. Enantiomers were separated on preparative HPLC with high optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). Based on electronic circular dichroism, the absolute configurations of dextrorotary and levorotatory antipodes were assigned as P and M, respectively. We also studied the absorption, emission and chiroptical behavior of these helical compounds in the solution state.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diynes Using Calcium Carbide as an Alkyne Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a surrogate of gaseous acetylene, calcium carbide can be directly used as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alkyne source for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild conditions using air as oxidant.







Abstract
A simple method for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes from iodoarenes using calcium carbide as an alkyne source and air as an oxidant is described. A series of 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes were efficiently synthesized by this strategy. The salient features of this protocol are the use of inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alkyne source, broad substrate scope, open&#8208;air condition, and simple operation procedure.

By varying the conditions of the reaction between (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;phenoxypent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol and aldehydes, we can either access biologically relevant hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]chromenes via a tandem Prins/Friedel&#8208;Crafts cascade or the tetrahydropyrane intermediate of the Prins process. In both cases, the products are obtained in high yields and good diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
We propose the synthesis of biologically relevant hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]chromenes, via a tandem Prins/Friedels&#8208;Crafts process, catalyzed by BF3.Et2O, starting from (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;phenoxypent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol. The diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the geometry of the homoallylic alcohol. We also point out that the Prins product can be obtained in high yields and good diastereoselectivity when the reaction is promoted by AlCl3 as Lewis acid in the presence of an external nucleophile.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Iminothiazolidines via Telescoping Reactions Including Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer and Domino Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization (DROC)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, iron&#8208;catalyzed aziridination (nitrene transfer) is combined in a single process to aziridine ring opening (DROC) to produce 2&#8208;iminothiazolidines which constitute interesting cores of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
2&#8208;iminothiazolidines are important scaffold for pharmaceutical drugs. Herein, we describe a fast and easy procedure for their synthesis by a telescoping reaction integrating an iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer under mild conditions. The aziridination reaction of olefins is followed by the domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) of the aziridine intermediates with organic isothiocyanates catalyzed by a Lewis acid leading to the desired product. This new synthetic route allows time, step and purification economies, which is in agreement with the development of more efficient processes for the synthesis of small molecules.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactones through Reaction of Sulfoxonium Ylides, Aldehydes, and Ketenes: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and disubstituted ketenes provides access to &#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to good diastereoselectivity favoring the trans&#8208;diastereomer (dr up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8). A [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is proposed to be the key mechanistic step.







Abstract
In this article, we describe the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and disubstituted ketenes. The one&#8208;pot sequential method provides access to &#947;&#8208;lactones from disubstituted ketenes, in moderate to excellent yields, and with good diastereoselectivity favoring the trans&#8208;diastereomer (dr up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8). The reaction mechanism was investigated by performing labeling, crossover, and various control experiments. The results of those experiments support the reaction mechanism involving betaine formation, reaction of the betaine with a ketene to form an enolate intermediate, [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of an enolate intermediate, and finally, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet cyclization to afford the &#947;&#8208;lactone product.

         <title>Analysis of Interconversion between Atropisomers of Chiral Substituted 9,9&#8217;&#8208;Bicarbazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atropisomeric enantiomers of chiral substituted 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole linked by a N&#8722;N bond were resolved by chiral HPLC for the first time. DFT calculations and heating experiments clarified that racemization did not take place below the temperature for N&#8722;N bond cleavage.







Abstract
Interconversion of atropisomers of chiral 3,3&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole linked by a single N&#8722;N bond was analyzed by DFT calculations and experiments. The calculations revealed that the trans transition state has a lower energy for the interconversion than the cis transition state. The lowest transition state of interconversion between natural dixiamycins A and B containing a 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole structure was found to be the trans transition state. The calculations also indicated that degradation through N&#8722;N bond cleavage was faster than racemization. Atropisomeric enantiomers of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole were resolved by chiral HPLC for the first time, and then racemization and N&#8722;N bond cleavage were investigated by heating experiments, showing that racemization did not take place below the degradation temperature.

         <title>Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Containing 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutanes: Advanced Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable and efficient approaches towards the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylcyclobutane building blocks are reported. Physico&#8208;chemical properties (i.&#8201;e. pKa and LogP) of the title building blocks or derivatives thereof are measured and compared with those for the non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts.







Abstract
Synthesis of previously unavailable 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane building blocks bearing mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups are disclosed. The key steps included deoxofluorination or TMAF&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution in the appropriate bifunctional cyclobutanes; for the CF3&#8208;substituted derivatives, alternative methods based on cyano&#8208; or azidotrifluoromethylation of cyclobutene using the Togni reagent II were also proposed. All methods provided trans diastereomers of the target primary amines and carboxylic acids (6 representatives) and were suitable for their multigram preparation. Furthermore, dissociation constants (pKa) and lipophilicity (logP) values were measured to evaluate the effect of the fluoroalkyl substituents on acidity/basicity and lipophilicity of the building blocks obtained.

A highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective KOt&#8208;Bu&#8208;catalyzed addition of substituted indoles to terminal or disubstituted allylic sulfones at the indole N&#8208;position is reported. The catalytic protocol allows for the efficient and mild synthesis of a broad range of new and versatile sulfonyl&#8208;substituted indoles and azoles bearing various functional groups from readily available starting materials in good to excellent yields with complete regioselectivity.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrophosphoryloxylation of Ynamides: Rapid Access to Enol Phosphates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An addition reaction between phosphoric acids and ynamides was developed for the synthesis of amino&#8208;derived enol phosphates. The protocol features metal&#8208;free conditions, exclusive selectivity, short reaction times, and easy scale&#8208;up. Notably, the resulting products could easily undergo Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature.







Abstract
We herein report a metal&#8208;free hydrophosphoryloxylation of ynamides with phosphoric acids, which provides an expeditious route to access useful enol phosphates. The advantages of this protocol include exclusive selectivity, short reaction time, high efficiency, and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the products can serve as good partners in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Substitutions of Benzylic Alcohols with Sulfamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfamidation of benzylic alcohols was achieved for the first time using nucleophilic substitutions catalyzed by FeCl3, as a Lewis acid. A variety of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted sulfamides were produced efficiently by this novel protocol.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions of benzylic alcohols with sulfamides were achieved using an FeCl3 Lewis acid catalyst in MeNO2. It was necessary to adjust the reaction conditions to obtain efficient yields depending on the stability of the carbocation intermediates. The reaction could easily be performed, and it was revealed that a variety of diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were applicable to the reaction, irrespective of the type and position of the substituents. The sulfamide moieties were easily deprotected and converted into amine groups.

         <title>Decarbonylative Issues Involved in Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed [6+2&#8722;1] Annulation Reaction of Hydroxychromone with Alkyne: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations have been used to explore the Ru&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative annulation of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;chromone with alkynes to synthesize spiro&#8208;indenebenzofuranones. A Ru(II)&#8722;Ru(0)&#8722;Ru(II) transformation was found to be involved in the decarbonylation process. The oxidative addition of C(carbonyl)&#8722;C(carbonyl) bond to Ru(0) is likely the rate&#8208;determining step. The regeneration of the catalyst is likely achieved by oxidation with air oxygen.







Abstract
Density functional theory calculations have been performed to explore the Ru&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative annulation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;chromone with an alkyne to synthesize spiroindenebenzofuranones. A Ru(II)&#8722;Ru(0)&#8722;Ru(II) rather than a Ru(II)&#8722;Ru(IV)&#8722;Ru(II) transformation was found involved in the decarbonylation process, which is responsible for the sequence of alkyne insertion/decarbonylation. Oxidative addition of C(carbonyl)&#8722;C(carbonyl) bond to Ru(0) and the Ru(II)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation were confirmed to be favorable for the decarbonylation, meanwhile oxidative addition of C(carbonyl)&#8722;C(carbonyl) bond to Ru(0) is likely to be the rate&#8208;determining step for the entire catalytic cycle. It is predicted that the regeneration of the catalyst was achieved by the oxidation of air oxygen in the absence of other oxidants. The current theoretical study provides new insights into the decarbonylative annulation.

         <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Iodide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI  2  is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI  2  . This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Efficient Synthesis of amides from alcohols using Cu&#8208;N&#8208;TiO2 heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides were synthesized directly from alcohols and amines in high yields using an in situ generated active ester of N&#8208;hydroxyimide with our developed Cu&#8208;N&#8208;TiO2 catalyst at room temperature using oxygen as a sole oxidant under visible light. The catalyst can be easily prepared, robust, and recycled four times without a considerable change in catalytic activity. This developed protocol applies to a wide range of substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. The application of this amidation reaction has been successfully demonstrated for the synthesis moclobemide, an antidepressant drug, and an analog of the Itopride drug in gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamides and Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates via a Modified Pfitzinger Reaction of N&#8208;Vinylisatins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic approach for the accelerated assembly of quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide and quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate nuclei is presented. The methodology is based on the rearrangement of  N  &#8208;vinylisatins promoted by different types of amines (or ethanol) in a Pfitzinger&#8208;type mechanism that in turn builds the quinoline ring system. The reaction took place only by heating the starting materials in ethanol, without any additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic alkoxylations of unactivated alkyl olefins and alpha&#8208;methyl styrene by photoredox catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  ,  N  &#8208;diisobutylaminophenyl&#8208;phenothiazine is a strongly reducing catalyst that allows &#8208;for the first time&#8208; the photoredox catalytic addition of alcohols to alkyl olefins as non&#8208;activated substrates to products with Markovnikov orientation. The irradiation at 365 nm does not require any additional reagent. Using a&#8208;methyl styrene as activated substrate we additionally show that this photoredox catalytic method tolerates other functional groups, including allyl, alkynyl, cyanide and even acid&#8208;labile Boc groups within the substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tuning of [1,3]&#8208;Dioxolo[4.5&#8208;f]benzodioxole (DBD) Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of oxygen by sulfur atoms of [1,3]&#8208;dioxolo[4.5&#8208;  f  ]benzodioxole (DBD) fluorescent dyes is an efficient way to adjust the photophysical properties (sulfur tuning). While previously developed S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes exhibit considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission wavelength, the heavy atom effect of four sulfur atoms cause low fluorescence quantum yields and short fluorescence lifetimes. Herein we demonstrate that the replacement of less than four sulfur atoms (S  1  &#8208;DBD, 1,2&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD, and 1,4&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes) permits a fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties. In some cases, a similar influence on the wavelength without the detrimental effect on the quantum yields and lifetimes is observed. Furthermore, the synthetic accessibility of S  1  &#8208; and S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes is improved, compared with S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes. For coupling with biomolecules a series of reactive derivatives of the new dyes were developed (azides, OSu esters, alkynes, maleimides).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzofurans and benzothiophenes are important pharmaceutical motifs, appearing in a broad range of small molecule therapeutic classes. Often overlooked by synthetic methodologists in favour reactions of the analogous indole bicyclic system, there are nevertheless a plurality of approaches to effecting benzofuran and benzothiophene C&#8208;H functionalisations. In this review, we summarise progress in this area over the past five years, including 1) alkylations, 2) arylations and heteroarylations, 3) carboxylations, carbamoylations and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and 4) cyclisations.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric guest binding in chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. The zirconium compound was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displays a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery the cooperativity factors &#945; (= 4K1/K2) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied widely as a bioisosteric component of drugs. Not found in nature, this molecular unit approximates the distance of a  p  &#8208;disubstituted benzene which is replaced in medicines as a method of improving treatments. Predicting interactions of these drugs with specific active sites requires knowledge of the non&#8208;covalent interactions engaged by this subunit. Structure determinations and computational analysis (Hirshfeld analysis, 2D fingerprint plots, DFT) of 7 BCP derivatives chosen to probe specific and directional interactions. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of various non&#8208;covalent interactions including I&#183;&#183;I, I&#183;&#183;N, N&#8208;  ..O, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;O, and H&#8208;C&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C contacts. The preference of halogen bonding (I&#183;&#183;I or I&#183;&#183;N) in BCP  1&#8208;4  strictly depends upon the electronic nature and angle between bridgehead substituents. The transannular distance in co&#8208;crystals  2  and  4  was longer as compared to monomers  1  and  3. Stronger N&#8208;H..O and weaker C&#8208;H..O contacts were observed for BCP  5  while the O  ..  H interaction was a prominent contact for BCP  6. The presence of 3D BCP units prevented the p&#183;&#183;p stacking between phenyl rings in  3,  4,  and  7. The BCP skeleton was often rotationally averaged, indicating fewer interactions compared to bridgehead groups. Using DFT analysis, geometries were optimized and molecular electrostatic potentials were calculated on the BCP surfaces. These interaction profiles may be useful for designing BCP analogs of drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation, characterization and reactivity of aliphatic amino iodane(III) reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of a new class of aliphatic amino iodane(III) reagents has been realized with the N&#8208;TMS&#8208;amine and acetoxybenziodazole participated in the formation of N&#8208;I bond. The amino&#8208;containing iodane(III) reagent 2d was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which revealed the expected hypervalent iodane distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. A practical copper&#8208;catalyzed, directed electrophilic amination of aryl amines employing amino&#8208;iodane(III) as amination agents was disclosed that proceeded smoothly without external additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Processes of Arynes Reacting with Three Classes of Nucleophiles for Organic Syntheses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic application of arynes is broadened by their reactions with neutral  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;, and  O  &#8208;containing nucleophiles to produce three types of compounds. Accordingly, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines are synthesized from Schiff bases, alkynes, and arynes through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Epoxides are prepared from thioethers and arynes along with aldehydes or ketones through a Johnson&#8208;Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky reaction. Phenolic ethers are produced from allyl ethers and arynes through a Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement. These target molecules, including natural products &#947;&#8208;asarone, asaricin, and a cholesteryl phenolic ether, are formed through reactions initiated by arynes. These new reactions share a prevailing feature of domino processes, which are carried out in a single flask and afford the desired products in good to high yields  .</dc:description>

         <title>N 1&#8208; and N3&#8208;Arylations of Hydantoins Employing Diaryliodonium Salts via Copper(I) Catalysis at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation (both N1&#8208; and N3&#8208;) of hydantoins with diaryliodonium salts as aryl partners at room temperature is reported. The transformation allows diverse scopes on both hydantoins and diaryliodonium salts delivering functionalized N3&#8208;arylated products under mild reaction conditions. The presence of hydrogens at C5&#8208; and N1&#8208; position of the hydantoin does not lead to other side products. Chiral hydantoins can also be synthesised via this methodology. Sterically&#8208;complicated ortho&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts are tolerated and delivered challenging ortho&#8208;arylated products. In addition, this strategy can also be effectively extended to N1&#8208;arylation of hydantoins.</dc:description>

         <title>PIFA&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of N&#8208;Heteroarenes with Cyclic Ethers: Ethanol as an Efficient Promoter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol is typically used in organic synthesis as an environmentally benign solvent. Herein, we wish to report a mild and efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of N&#8208;heteroarenes with cyclic ethers by uncovering the new reactivity of ethanol as an efficient promoter in PIFA&#8208;mediated radical process. The reaction proceeds smoothly under the irradiation of visible light and features excellent functional group compatibility, which allows the expedite synthesis of a variety of medicinally valuable C  &#945;  &#8208;heteroarylated cyclic ethers in moderate to high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Nucleobase di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalized Porphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of nucleobase&#8208;functionalized porphyrins was achieved  via  two strategies: substitution and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Following the first strategy resulted in four porphyrins having two nucleobases at the&#160;  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by flexible methylene linkers. In order to synthesize the targeted molecules, 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin) was reacted with thymine, cytosine, adenine and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine, a precursor of guanine, in the presence of a suitable base. Thymine and cytosine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N1 site, whereas adenine and amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N9 site. The synthesis of a porphyrin bearing four thymine moieties at its four  meso&#8208;  positions is also described. &#160;Furthermore, following the Sonogashira cross coupling reaction strategy led to the formation of&#160; four new porphyrins bearing two NBs in  trans  positions. Ethynyl&#8208;substituted nucleobases were reacted with 5,15&#8208;dibromo&#8208;10,20&#8208;dipentylporphyrin under sonogashira cross coupling conditions to result in four rigid porphyrins having two nucleobases at the  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by rigid ethynyl linkers.&#160; All the tectons have been characterized and could be used in the formation of molecular H&#8208;bonded networks. The porphyrin bearing cytosine via ethynyl linkers self&#8208;assembled into a 2D hydrogen bonded network formed by the complementary interactions between the cytosine moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of lipophilicity on the activity of hexameric cyclic peptoid ion carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two families of hexameric cyclic peptoids decorated with linear  N  &#8208;alkyl and alternated  N  &#8208;alkyl/  N  &#8208;benzyl side chains (  2a&#8208;d  and  3a&#8208;c  , respectively) were designed and synthesized in order to correlate their logP values (from 2.55 to 6.83) to their ionophoric activities. The present contribution confirms the general ability of hexameric cyclic peptoids to behave as efficient cation carriers, corroborates their preference for Na  +  ion, among the tested alkali metals, and suggests a Na  +  /H  +  antiport transport mechanism (rate limited by the transport of the proton) for these new ionophores. Our observations indicate that in order to attain an efficient ionophoric activity, a narrow range of liphophilicity is required (4&lt; logP &lt; 5). Moreover, to gain information on the solid state stucture of ionophoric cyclic peptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains,&#160;X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies were performed on exemplar compound  2a  . Crystal structure of compound  2a  confirms the tendency of ionophoric cyclopeptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains to form layered assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Osmium&#8208;Free Olefin syn&#8208;Dihydroxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols are valuable scaffolds for building a vast number of biologically active compounds and are also important synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. This review focuses on a concise summary of the main metal&#8208;catalyzed methods of olefin syn&#8208;dihydroxylation developed over the past ten years to circumvent the use of osmium.






The syn&#8208;dihydroxylation of olefinic group is one of the most important synthetic transformations which leads to the controlled formation of syn&#8208;diol. Such 1,2&#8208;diol structure is integrated into more complex architectures and substantially participates in the development of biologically active molecules and other fine chemicals. This minireview describes recent evolution of this research field in the past decade, surveying osmium&#8208;free and more eco&#8208;compatible system and in particular the direct oxidation of olefins catalyzed by transition metal complexes.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Thiopyrans via thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Photochemically Generated Thioaldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyrans are important structural motifs both in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. A continuous flow&#8208;process for the photochemical generation of thioaldehydes from phenacyl sulfides and the ensuing [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;dienes was developed. The cycloadducts were obtained with excellent yields in short reaction times and much improved productivities as compared to classical batch reactions.






Herein, we report a novel protocol for the photochemical generation of thioaldehydes in a continuous flow process which were in situ reacted with electron rich 1,3&#8208;butadienes in thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. A broad range of 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyrans were formed as products in much higher yields and productivities as compared to classical batch processes. Moreover, greatly reduced reaction times and a facile large&#8208;scale preparation of products were achieved by fully exploiting the advantages of continuous flow technology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Tris&#8208;Primary Amine Based Organic Imine Cages and Related Amine Macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular integration of Tris&#8208;primary amine moiety and multiple aldehyde centers often leads to organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles which demand commendable position in the field of material science and supramolecular chemistry. In this review we highlighted recent studies regarding the synthesis and special features of such OICs and their saturated counterparts.






Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the field of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science. In this review we aimed to consider recent reports that highlighted the syntheses, special features, and applications of primary triamine based OICs and related amine macrocycles.

These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the field of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science. In this review we aimed to consider recent reports that highlighted the syntheses, special features, and applications of primary triamine based OICs and related amine macrocycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unexpected ring opening during the imination of camphor&#8208;type bicyclic ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new ring opening reaction was found while attempting to isolate the imines from  ortho  &#8208;heteroatom substituted anilines and camphor&#8208;like bicyclic ketones. The benzoazoles containing a cyclopentanemethyl group at position 2 of the heterocycle were isolated instead of the expected imines. The detailed study of the transformation, including EPR experiments, revealed the most probable radical mechanism. The proposed reaction pathways were confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The dichotomy of 1&#8209;2 and 2&#8209;3 bonds cleavage is discussed together with the evaluation of the stereochemical outcome of the reactions. The benzoazoles obtained via the new reaction are of particular interest for the medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fungicide precursor racemization kinetics for deracemization in complex systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the racemization area, the keto&#8208;enol equilibrium is a major player when it comes to racemizing &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The racemization kinetics in the co&#8208;crystal induced deracemization of a fungicide precursor is complex as next to the racemization catalyst, which is a base, an acidic co&#8208;former is used to ensure the crystallization of the co&#8208;crystal. Here we show that understanding of the racemization kinetics of the target compound is of key importance for optimization of the co&#8208;crystallization based deracemization process. The racemization rates in solution as a function of solvent and base concentration were determined by measuring the decreasing enrichment of the chiral ketone due to racemization over time, using a polarimeter set&#8208;up with a continuous recycling loop through the polarimeter cell. The established racemization kinetics model aligns with the experimental data giving access to the intrinsic racemization rate constant. The proposed mechanism is first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess of the target compound and the base&#8208;catalyst concentration. The solvent is shown to affect the racemization constant, with protic solvents increasing this rate substantially. Finally, we observed the presence of the chiral acid co&#8208;former to alter the reaction mechanism albeit remaining first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess. Though more complex, the mechanism still followed Arrhenius law, providing key information on the impact of temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;connected 2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)aldehydes for the design of UV&#8208;responsive functional molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use click chemistry to functionalize simple lipophilic and water&#8208;soluble molecules, a complex PEGylated phospholipid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000), and two benzylic substrates with the 2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)aldehyde (HIA) group. To this end, we synthesize two terminal alkynes bearing the HIA moiety and we couple them to different azides through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Norrish&#8208;Yang photoisomerization (&#955;= 365 nm, LED source) is successfully obtained, with no interference by the triazole linker, except when the forbidden  n&#8208;&#960;*  carbonyl transition is screened by a remote substituent such as salicylaldehyde. UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry suggests a specific interaction of HIAs with Cu(II), whereas no such evidence is found with Cu(I). We thereby show that the CuAAC methodology can be used successfully to obtain HIA&#8208;based UV&#8208;responsive hydrophilic or lipophilic ligands, phospholipidic components for the construction of liposomes, and macrocycle precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses and Applications of Spirocyclopropyl Oxindoles: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclopropyl oxindole comprising spiro&#8208;fusion of 2&#8208;oxindole with cyclopropane unit is a versatile organic framework. The present review highlights the detailed chemistry of spirocyclopropyl oxindole core. Various synthetic approaches to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been discussed followed by their applications in ring&#8208;opening/expansion reactions.






Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulfur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.

         <title>Front Cover: Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a crossroad, metaphorically representing the possibility of a phenol to be oxidized to an ortho&#8208; or a para&#8208;quinone depending on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs &#955;5&#8208;iodane). However, things are not so straightforward, since prototropic equilibria and valence tautomerization can provide a diversion from the selected pathway. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#160;Caprioglio, G.&#160;Appendino et al.

         <title>Photoinduced decarboxylative radical addition reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of peptide substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Here, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.</dc:description>

         <title>I2&#8208;promoted direct C&#8208;H sulfenylation of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones with sulfonyl chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, efficient, and green method for the iodine&#8208;promoted regioselective C&#8208;4 sulfenylation of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2  H  )&#8208;ones using commercially available aryl sulfonyl chlorides as the sulfur source was described under metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Hydrophosphinylation of &#945;&#8208;Acyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Diazoacetates</title>

A simple Cu&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative hydrophosphinylation of &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates with hydrophosphoryl compounds is developed through the generation of (diazomethyl)ketones and the subsequent C&#8211;P coupling. The findings imply the potential use of the relatively more readily available &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates as replacement of (diazomethyl)ketones in some cases.






A simple copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation&#8211;denitrogenation C&#8211;P coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates with hydrophosphoryl compounds is reported. The reaction may proceed via a process involving the generation of (diazomethyl)ketones after hydrolysis in the presence of water and the hydrophosphinylation of the copper carbene intermediates. This finding may suggest the potential use of the relatively more readily available &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates as replacement of (diazomethyl)ketones in some cases.

         <title>InBr3&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction between Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenyl Ethers with Silyl Enolates for Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InBr3 catalysis enables the coupling between 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers and silyl enolates to give 1,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes featuring alkene moieties with perfect stereoselectivity. Various types of 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers and silyl enolates are applicable to the present reaction. InBr3 with moderate Lewis acidity plays an important role in both the activation of alkenyl ethers and in the elimination of alkoxy groups regardless of the presence of various coordinative functional groups.






A coupling reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkenyl ethers with silyl enolates catalyzed by InBr3 was achieved. Various silyl enolates and 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers were applicable, giving the corresponding 1,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes with perfect stereoselectivity of the alkene moieties. The present coupling reaction proceeds via the 1,4&#8208;addition of silyl enolates to alkenyl ethers followed by elimination of silyl alkoxides, in which moderate&#8208;Lewis acidic InBr3 performs both the activation of alkenyl ethers and the elimination of alkoxy groups regardless of the presence of various coordinative functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Anemoclemosides A and B, Two Saponins Isolated from Anemoclema glaucifolium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The straightforward and scalable syntheses of the triterpenoid saponins Anemoclemoside A and B are described. Both compounds feature an unusual cyclic acetal linkage to the carbohydrate l&#8208;arabinose in its open chain form. A mild and facile method was employed to construct the characteristic cyclic acetal glycosidic linkage in both saponins via the PTSA catalyzed condensation of benzyl hederagenate with the respective saccharide side chains.






Steroidal and triterpenoid saponins are attractive for their wide&#8208;ranging pharmacological properties. The triterpenoid saponins Anemoclemoside A and B are root constituents of the Chinese folk medicinal plant Anemoclema glaucifolium (Ranunculaceae). Both compounds feature an unusual cyclic acetal linkage to the carbohydrate l&#8208;arabinose in its open chain form rather than the typical glycosidic bond present in normal saponins. The straightforward and scalable syntheses of both saponins starting from l&#8208;arabinose as well as l&#8208;lyxose and l&#8208;rhamnose are described.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rigid Multidimensional Alkoxyamines: A Building Block Library for Polymer Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the &#8220;living&#8221; free&#8208;radical polymerization, alkoxyamines were widely used in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP). Most of the known alkoxyamines bear just one functionality with only a few exceptions bearing two or more alkoxyamine units. Herein, we present a library of novel multidimensional alkoxyamines based on commercially available, rigid, aromatic core structures. A versatile approach allows the introduction of different sidechains which have an impact on the steric hindrance and dissociation behavior of the alkoxyamines. The reaction to the alkoxyamines was optimized by implementing a mild and reliable procedure to give all target compounds in high yields. Utilization of biphenyl, p&#8208;terphenyl, 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, tetraphenylethylene, and tetraphenyl&#8208;methane results in linear, trigonal, square planar, and tetrahedral shaped alkoxyamines. These building blocks are useful initiators for multifold NMP leading to star&#8208;shaped polymers or as a linker for the nitroxide exchange reaction (NER), to obtain dynamic frameworks with a tunable crosslinking degree and self&#8208;healing abilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Push&#8211;Pull Imines by a Selective C&#8211;F Substitution Process in Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of push&#8211;pull imines is reported, which are formed through a selective aromatic nucleophilic substitution of fluoroarenes by N&#8211;H substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs), without the need of any additional catalyst. As a result, a straightforward methodology was developed for the formation of different fluoroaryl&#8208;substituted push&#8211;pull imines.






Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of push&#8211;pull imines by considering cyclic diamino substituent at the C&#8208;centre and fluoroaryl substituent at the N&#8208;centre. This has been achieved by a selective aromatic nucleophilic substitution of different fluoroarenes by N&#8208;H&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) at ambient conditions without any additional reagent. Solid&#8208;state molecular structure analysis reveals the elongation of the central C&#8211;N bond of the imine functionality, which is consistent with the push&#8211;pull nature of these imines. The push&#8211;pull nature of these imines is further validated by computational studies.

         <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up to date review regarding the SNAr of seven different types of porphyrinoids, each containing differing numbers and types of pyrrole rings and meso positions is presented. The reactivity and mechanistic analysis of subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines shows a bright future for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids via this reaction mechanism.






The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (SNAr) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. Currently, several &#8220;types&#8221; of SNAr reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein, we detail the SNAr reactions of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.

         <title>Substituted Naphthols: Preparations, Applications, and Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted Naphthols are amongst some of the most important carbocycles in organic chemistry. This review focuses on a plethora of important routes to access such structures of high value. Emphasis on reactants employed, reaction types, and their mechanisms is examined.






Substituted naphthols (SNs) are an important class of chemical compounds present in many natural and synthetic products with biological and pharmaceutical activities. Moreover, the naphthol skeleton has been employed as a starting material for the development of drug molecules and natural products. Thus, different synthetic methods to access naphthol cores have been reported using diverse starting materials and chemical strategies. This review article describes literature on synthetic methodologies of substituted naphthols synthesized from alkynes, sulfur ylides, diazo substrates, alkenes/cyclopropenes, ketones/oxanorbenes/furans, amongst other key reactants.

         <dc:description>
The mechanisms of the palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a diyne diester with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and of the [2+2+2] cyclization of a triyne diester were investigated using density functional theory calculations. The roles of the ester substituents on the alkyne substrates and of the triphenylphosphine ligand are discussed based on the obtained results.






The mechanisms of the palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a diyne diester with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and of the [2+2+2] cyclization of a triyne diester were investigated using density functional theory calculations. After evaluating the kinetic and thermodynamic profiles of each reaction, the roles of the ester substituents on the alkyne substrates and of the triphenylphosphine ligand are discussed based on the obtained results. Moreover, the previously unreported cross [2+2+2] cycloaddition of the diyne diester with nitriles was also investigated, in order to evaluate its feasibility under the relevant experimental conditions.

         <title>Facile Construction of Benzofulvene Scaffold from Tetraaryl[3]cumulene Through Electrophilic Iodocyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of tetraaryl[3]cumulenes with N&#8208;iodosuccinimide afforded the corresponding iodinated triarylbenzofulvenes with high yields under mild reaction conditions through electrophilic iodocyclization. The iodinated benzofulvene was successfully used as versatile precursor for common cross&#8208;coupling reaction.






We found that the reaction of tetraaryl[3]cumulenes with N&#8208;iodosuccinimide afforded the corresponding iodinated triarylbenzofulvenes with high yields under mild reaction conditions. Unsymmetrical tetraaryl[3]cumulenes underwent regioselective reactions to give a single isomer of benzofulvenes depending on the aryl substituents. The obtained iodinated benzofulvene was successfully used as aryl iodide for common cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and the corresponding tetrasubstituted benzofulvenes was easily accessed via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, respectively.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Aminoalkylation of 5&#8208;Aminopyrazole Derivatives with Cyclic Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective alkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles is described with good results. The organocatalytic alkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles have been accomplished using benzoxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxides as electrophiles and a bifunctional squaramide organocatalyst.






In this communication, an efficient asymmetric aminoalkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic benzoxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxides catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived squaramide in dichloromethane has been established. This is the first example of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives in asymmetric catalysis. A variety of chiral sulfamidates bearing an aminopyrazole moiety were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%ee).

         <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

The Si&#8208;containing three membered ring systems lack stability, due to the high strain, hence need tremendous efforts for its preparation.

         <title>Evolution of Strategies in Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of Natural Products: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights the recently achieved efficient total syntheses of many natural products based on chiron, auxiliary, cascade, biomimetic and photocatalytic approaches, as well as protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free strategies, leading to overall economy and efficiency in synthesis.






The synthesis of complex natural products must be realized with high economy and efficiency, contributing largely to sustainable development in synthetic organic chemistry. The new strategies should adopt protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free approaches enabling step&#8208;economy and thereby enhancing efficiency. Various approaches based on chiral pool, auxiliary&#8208;based methods, cascade, biomimetic, enzymatic and photocatalytic used in total synthesis of natural products and following the PGF&#8208;criteria over the last two years (2018&#8211;2019) have been reviewed here. These should guide sustainable synthesis of natural products in the future.

         <title>Hydroarylation of N&#8208;Allenyl Derivatives Catalyzed by Copper[**]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereoselective addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to N&#8208;allenyl derivatives is described under copper catalysis. represents the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.






An additive&#8208;free copper catalytic system was used to perform the addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to N&#8208;allenyl derivatives. This intermolecular C&#8211;C bond formation occurs with both complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to afford the linear (E) allylic product with moderate to excellent yields. This atom economical method is the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.

&lt;p&gt;The regio&#8208; and stereoselective addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allenyl derivatives is described under copper catalysis. represents the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additive&#8208;free copper catalytic system was used to perform the addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allenyl derivatives. This intermolecular C&#8211;C bond formation occurs with both complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to afford the linear (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) allylic product with moderate to excellent yields. This atom economical method is the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triptycene End&#8208;Capped Indigo Derivatives &#8211; Turning Insoluble Pigments to Soluble Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triptycene end&#8208;capping is the solution to turn insoluble pigments into soluble dyes by a factor of 70, making them potential good electron&#8208;acceptors for various organic electronics applications.






The synthesis of a highly soluble triptycene end&#8208;capped indigo and its bay annulated derivative is reported. Both compounds have been studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy cyclic voltammetry, as well as theoretical calculations and compared to the parent indigo and bay annulated indigo. Besides a large improvement of solubility in organic solvents by the factor of approx. 70(!) the compounds also show a pronounced tendency to form crystals. Both properties, making these compounds promising electron acceptors for organic electronics.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;oxidative prototropic&#8208; and valence tautomeric equilibria are responsible for the exclusive formation of p&#8208;quinones in the &#955;5&#8208;iodane oxidation of cannabinoids. O&#8208;Methylation prevents prototropic equilibration and, by complementary timing of oxidation and methylation steps, isomeric ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cannabinoquinoids could be obtained.






Spurred by the remarkable biological profile of cannabinoquinoids, we have systematically investigated the periodinane oxidation of their resorcinolic precursors, discovering that the regiochemistry of oxidation, a critical maneuver for bioactivity, depends not only on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs. &#955;5&#8208;iodanes), but also on post&#8208;oxidative prototropic&#8208; and valence tautomeric equilibria that isomerize ortho&#8208;quinones to para&#8208;quinones. By complementary selection of the periodinane oxidant and by freezing prototropic equilibration with O&#8208;methylation, isomeric ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;quinones could be obtained from mono&#8208; and diphenolic cannabinoids, setting the stage for the exploration of novel areas of the biological space, and establishing a blueprint for the extension of this strategy to other classes of bioactive alkylresorcinols.

         <dc:description>A simple, photochemical and metal&#8208;free protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of bromotrichloromethane onto various alkenes is described. Among a range of organic molecules, phenylglyoxylic acid proved to be the most suitable photoinitiator to promote a sustainable process for the addition of bromotrichloromethane to olefins. This photochemical atom transfer radical protocol can be expanded into a wide substrate scope of aliphatic olefins bearing various functional groups, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiourea&#8211;Tertiary Amine Promoted Cascade Catalysis: A Tool for Complexity Generation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in the area of the thiourea&#8211;tert&#8208;amine promoted, single catalyst&#8208;relay cascade catalysis for the last fifteen years (2005&#8211;2020). This would give the readers the current state of the art of this important area in organic synthesis for the generation of chiral polycyclic systems. We assume that the current review would be a handle for the design and development, as well as further growth of this potentially greener approach.






The bifunctional organocatalyst promoted, relay&#8208;cascade catalysis (use of a single catalyst capable of promoting each catalytic cycle in the designed cascade process) has been the hot area of research in recent times, as it enables the green synthesis of complex molecular architectures in an atom, cost, and step&#8208;economic fashion. In this context we summarized the recent developments in the area of the thiourea&#8211;tert&#8208;amine based cascade catalysis in the current review article. The discussion was divided into three subsections. double&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple cascades depending on the number of individual steps involved in the cascade process. In each type there are various combinations of reactions like Michael addition, aldol reaction, Henry reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, cyclization, trans&#8208;esterifications etc. Divergent polycyclic structural frameworks have been achieved employing this cascade catalytic strategy as evidenced in this review. We assume that the current review article would be a handle for the design and development as well as further growth of this potential greener approach.

         <title>Symmetrical Tertiary Amines: Applications and Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The World is &#8220;based&#8221; on some principle components. One type of such &#8220;bases&#8221; is the symmetrical tertiary amines. Applications of such amines and different approaches to their synthesis are described in this review.






Tertiary amines represent a key class of organic molecules with multiple industrial, synthetic, and analytical applications. The focus of this review is on different approaches towards the synthesis of the C3 and C3V symmetrical tertiary amines. Generally, symmetrical tertiary amines can be prepared via N&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides and alcohols, reductive amination, desamination, hydroamination of olefins, and different kinds of C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. All reactions leading to the titled structures are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are provided.

         <title>Biomedical Hydrogels Fabricated Using Diels&#8211;Alder Crosslinking</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interest in Diels&#8208;Alder conjugation for biomaterials development is constantly increasing. In this minireview we highlight how this one step reaction can be employed to develop drug delivery systems and scaffold for tissue engineering. An overview of recent examples is provided in which DA cycloaddition has been exploited under mild condition and eventually in presence of cells.






The Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition is one of the best methods for biomaterials conjugation to generate tools for biomedical applications. It is a biocompatible one&#8208;step reaction, exploiting functional groups absent in natural biopolymers, doesn't require catalysts, and doesn't generate side products, an ideal &#8220;click reaction&#8221;. In this review we provide an overview on the recent examples in which the DA cycloaddition has been exploited in nanomedicine. Nanoparticles for drug delivery or diagnosis, and nanostructured biomaterials for regenerative medicine, have been efficiently generated exploiting the DA reaction to crosslink the polymeric components, in order to obtain nanoparticles or scaffolds with the required chemical and morphological properties, and to conjugate targeting agents or signalling molecules.

         <title>Cyclative MCRs of Azines and Azinium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The high atom economic feature of multicomponent reactions may open the way to sustainable pharmaceutical chemical processes. This review covers their recent applications for the synthesis N&#8208;heterocycles emphasizing dearomatizative examples.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Since the first discovery by Huigsen and co&#8208;workers fifty years ago, a wide range of organic reactions have taken place through the intermediary of the dipolar/zwitterionic species produced by the combination of a neutral nucleophile and an unsaturated electrophile. Nucleophilic initiators including heterocycles may react or play a mediating role based on their nucleophilic nature and reaction conditions. This review highlights the recent developments of the cyclization chemistry of heterocycles using multicomponent reactions (MCRs) &#8211; including unusual dearomatizative examples. Heterocycles as very common structural units can often be found in natural and pharmaceutical products. MCRs are environmentally benign and highly atom economic reactions. Their application in the synthesis of biologically active molecules may provide alternatives for the greener synthesis of drugs lowering the carbon footprint of pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Recent Progress in Non&#8208;Catalytic C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The present review demonstrates that the synthetic potential of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides performs it possible to successfully use them in the synthesis and modification of substances with high molecular complexity, including natural targets. Several effective catalyst&#8208;free approaches for regioselective C&#8211;O, C&#8211;S, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;N, and C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling, including Suzuki&#8208; and Heck&#8208;like reactions, are especially noteworthy.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Considerable attention holds on the chemistry and application of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides due to their advantages as building&#8208;blocks in organic synthesis and importance in biomedical research. On the other hand, in recent years the development of selective methods for constructing C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;O bonds via direct C&#8211;H functionalization has become especially demand in organic synthesis. These circumstances determine the significance of this minireview, which present recent advances in the field of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides. Data on various type reactions which formal result is the replacement of a hydrogen atom in a heterocycle, with the exclusion of methods using heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, are summarized. Presented works for the last 15 years, since 2006.

         <title>Overcoming the Hurdles and Challenges Associated with Developing Continuous Industrial Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Flow chemistry, on paper, is a straightforward concept with most chemists from academia and industry now well versed in the associated advantages. This Minireview highlights some of the common pitfalls and considers solutions to successfully navigate implementation of cryogenic flow processes or those whereby solid handling is required. This should accelerate the development of similar processes and help chemists to avoid the pitfalls!
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Continuous flow chemistry is often viewed as a very simple concept on paper, however scientists with significant flow chemistry experience will highlight a number of challenges that need to be overcome. Critical for the successful development of any flow process is a high level of understanding of potential pitfalls that may be encountered. A collaborative and multi&#8208;disciplinary team of chemists and chemical engineers is essential in the development of a process from lab scale through to production. This Minireview will identify and highlight relevant risks and their subsequent mitigation strategies to ensure successful flow processing.

         <title>Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones: A Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The present review describes the methodologies reported for the synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones. This heterocyclic moiety forms the core structure of many natural products with potent biological activities, which has fuelled the research on finding new routes to access it and has resulted in the introduction of elegant total syntheses. All the catalytic, asymmetric, and biosynthetic approaches towards substituted 3(2H)&#8208;furanones are discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The present review describes the methods reported for the synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones. This heterocycle forms the core structure of a number of natural products and biologically active scaffolds. We have covered all reports available on the synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanone derivatives and have divided the review into several sections based on the substitution patterns present in the heterocycle. Special emphasis is given to the generality and the mechanistic rationalizations of each methodology. In addition, all total syntheses reported for the synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanone containing natural products are reviewed by highlighting the heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Calcium Carbide: Versatile Synthetic Applications, Green Methodology and Sustainability</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Advantageous potential of calcium carbide as a solid acetylene reagent in organic chemistry is highlighted in this review. Synthetic opportunities are mapped to expand the synthetic applications of C&#8801;C unit. Particular attention is focused on new approaches elaborated in a recent period.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations. However, critical analysis of practical considerations showed that application of gaseous acetylene in regular synthetic labs encounters a number of difficulties. Safety limitations due to flammable and explosive nature of gaseous acetylene and requirements for specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment impose serious drawbacks. Typical reaction conditions involve excess of gaseous reactant, which is simply released to the atmosphere at the end of the reaction, thus generating waste and causing contamination. Calcium carbide brings a new green and sustainable wave into powerful alkyne transformations and significantly expands the repertoire of traditional acetylene chemistry. The novel trend of using calcium carbide instead of gaseous acetylene is synthetically beneficial and opens a novel reactivity for the C&#8801;C unit. This review highlights recent advances in carbide chemistry, demonstrates its advantages and prospects in term of green synthetic approach.

  Simple Cinchona alkaloids serve as nucleophilic organocatalysts to facilitate the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters by using hypervalent iodine&#8208;based Cl&#8208;transfer reagents
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We herein report an unprecedented strategy for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters with hypervalent iodine&#8208;based Cl&#8208;transfer reagents using simple Cinchona alkaloid catalysts. Our investigations support an &#945;&#8208;chlorination mechanism where the Cinchona species serves as a nucleophilic catalyst by reacting with the chlorinating agent to generate a chiral electrophilic Cl&#8208;transfer reagent in situ. Using at least 20 mol&#8208;% of the alkaloid catalyst allows for good yields and enantioselectivities for a variety of different &#946;&#8208;keto esters under operationally simple conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.

  The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heterofunctionalized &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives has been a heavily investigated topic.

  The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heterofunctionalized &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives has been a heavily investigated topic over the last years, benefiting from the development of novel catalysis concepts as well as from the introduction of suited new precursor entities. Within this short review, we wish to give an illustrative overview of the most successfully applied concepts to access these targets, like asymmetric &#945;&#8208;heterofunctionalizations or asymmetric C&#8211;C&#8208;bond forming reactions of already heterofunctionalized precursors.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Although the synthesis of 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes is widely reported in the literature, some specific methods for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes are more scarcely described. The isolation, these last ten past years, of several natural products containing this framework enhanced the interest in the synthesis of these structures. Thus, we propose herein a tentative exhaustive compilation of the methods reported to build 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The reactions are classified according their mechanism, from nucleophilic substitutions with hydroperoxide derivatives to radical reactions with triplet oxygen, reaction with electrophilic singlet oxygen, or reaction and functionalization from peroxycarbenium species.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Endoperoxides are a source of bioactive compounds which drove to some important anti&#8208;malarial drugs such as artemisinin or arterolane. 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes drew the attention of many scientists, through the isolation of numerous natural products containing this peroxidized ring structure such as the plakinic acid family or the biosynthetic study of prostaglandins. Thus, a considerable work was reported for the synthesis of such endoperoxides, but mainly applied to the synthesis of 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The recent isolation of new natural products containing a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted dioxolane ring brought our attention on how to specifically prepare such structures. Herein, we tentatively summarize exhaustively all the methods reported for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. Therefore, nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide, use of electrophilic singlet oxygen, use of triplet oxygen in radical reaction and the chemistry of peroxycarbenium ions will be presented for this purpose.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
