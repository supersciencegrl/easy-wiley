         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8208;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Carbanion Attack on Nitro vs. Carbonyl Group: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>

A green, one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free synthetic approach to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones and indolo[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinoline&#8208;6,12&#8208;diones is presented starting with indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that the reactions are initiated by attack of a conjugate base of indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones to the aldehyde or to the adjacent nitro group of 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes followed by intramolecular cyclization involving a second anion to furnish the appropriate products.







Abstract
Highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of indeno[2,1&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones 10 and indolo[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinoline&#8208;6,12&#8208;diones 12 is portrayed from easily accessible starting materials such as indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones 7 and 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and computational analysis reveal that the reactions are initiated by attack of a conjugate base of indanones 7 to the aldehyde group or the adjacent nitro group of 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9 followed by intramolecular cyclization involving a second anion to furnish the appropriate products. The heterocyclic compounds were obtained in moderate to good yields.

         <title>A Supramolecular Gel that Exhibits Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsiveness and High Conductivity through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of gel monomer was designed and synthesized, and a supramolecular conductive gel with excellent conductivity and multiple stimulus responsiveness was constructed through host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Atom Transfer Radical Addition of CBr4 onto Alkenes as a Key Step for Their Conversion to Propargylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the radical anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of CBr4 onto various alkenes has been developed, using phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator, leading to the desired products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The conversion of the produced 1,1,1,3&#8208;tetrabromo derivatives to secondary or tertiary propargylamines in two steps has been demonstrated.







Abstract
&#913; green and sustainable metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of carbon tetrabromide onto alkenes was developed. Phenylglyoxylic acid was employed as the photoinitiator to promote the water&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov photochemical addition. A vast variety of alkenes was employed successfully, providing the corresponding products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The photochemical protocol found an application towards the three&#8208;step synthesis of secondary or tertiary propargylamines starting from alkenes.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study discloses an efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters, which proceeds by only irradiating blue LED. The synthetic research revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of the bond alteration in the aromatic rings to determine the regioselectivity







Abstract
The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8722;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.

         <title>Synthesis of [6,5,5]Ring&#8208;Fused Tricyclic Triazoles by Copper&#8208;Promoted Double Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was coupled with cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles. Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was investigated on 2&#8208;iodoaryl propynes or propynones. With catalytic amount of Cu(I) salts or with N&#8208;donor ligands on copper only the products of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions were formed. However, with an equimolar amount of copper(I) iodide and triethylamine new [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles were formed by azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditon coupled to a cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important biologically active compounds and synthetic intermediates. Known methods for their synthesis are limited mostly to triazoles fused to six&#8208;membered or larger rings. Herein we disclose a synthetic approach to triazoles fused to five&#8208;membered rings based on copper(I)&#8208;promoted double cyclization consisting of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, followed by cross coupling to aryl iodides.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Thioamides via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic method from amines and boronic acids has been developed to get access to thioamides. The success of this transformation relies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thiocarbamoyl fluorides and boronic acids. This novel reaction feature with good functional group tolerance, mild conditions and providing a variety of thioamides in good yields.







Abstract
A novel and efficient one&#8208;pot method has been developed for the synthesis of thioamides through coupling reactions between thiocarbamoyl fluorides, which are generated in&#8197;situ from amines, and boronic acids. The key to the success of this transformation lies in the use of nickel a catalyst combined with PCy3 as a ligand. This innovative reaction protocol provides mild reaction conditions suitable for producing a diverse array of thioamides, and the late&#8208;stage modification of amoxapine was successfully achieved.

This article describes a greener methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of functionalized 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one and their deuterium analogues using an uncatalyzed imine formation&#8208;cyclization approach with good yields on the greenest solvent, water/heavy water.

Abstract
Herein we describe an uncatalyzed and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for the diastereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;nitro dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones through an imine formation&#8208;cyclization reaction on water medium. Water is an essential medium to effect this reaction efficiently without any catalyst. In addition, the synthesis of deuterium labelled 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones has been accomplished using this protocol. The key characteristics of this approach include catalyst free, scalable, mild reaction condition, easy isolation, and greenest solvent medium.

         <title>Acceptor End&#8208;functionalization of Naphthalenediimide Bithiophene Oligomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
IC and RD end&#8208;functionalization of T2&#8208;(NDI&#8722;T2)n oligomers is achieved in two steps in high yields. Upon performing the Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of piperidine as base, tricyclic end groups form for n =2. Weak nucleophilic bases such as pyridine/Et3N prevent this side reaction. Optoelectrical properties and crystallinity of the acceptor&#8208;terminated oligomers are studied in detail.







Abstract
Oligomeric materials combine advantageous properties of both their small molecule and polymeric counterparts. Utilizing oligomers as non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been shown to be extremely useful for the development of organic solar cells with high efficiency, reproducible performance and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report on two series of synthetically simple acceptor&#8208;terminated oligomers A&#8722;T2&#8208;(NDI&#8722;T2)n&#8208;A with naphthalene diimide (NDI) and bithiophene (T2) cores up to the trimer (n =1,2,3). Termination of the oligomers is done using the strong acceptors (A) dicyanomethylene&#8208;indanone (IC) and rhodanine (RD). Upon acceptor termination in the presence of piperidine (pip) as base, oligomers with pip&#8208;substituted tricyclic end groups are obtained in high yield. We investigate the effect of oligomer length and acceptor end group on opto&#8208;electronic properties and crystallinity. Both IC&#8208; and RD&#8208;termination increase electron affinity compared to the parent, non&#8208;functionalized cores. UV&#8208;vis absorption in solution slightly redshifts as the chain length increases without showing a distinct aggregation. Asymmetric termination with hexylphenyl&#8208;substituted indacenodithiophene (IDT) and IC is also possible. All symmetric oligomers show a strong tendency for crystallization, with the oligomer having the tricyclic end group exhibiting the highest melting enthalpy and temperature. The asymmetric IDT&#8722;T2&#8208;NDI&#8722;T2&#8208;IC oligomer is amorphous.

         <title>S&#8208;Aryl Substitution Enhances Acidity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large series of novel N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts with 3&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substituents was prepared from neutral S&#8208;aryl triazole precursors. High protofugalities (kinetic acidities) were demonstrated for C(5)&#8208;H highlighting the acidifying effect of the distal C(3)&#8208;sulfur with mechanistic insight obtained from XRD&#8208;protofugality correlations.







Abstract
The 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre&#8208;catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity&#8208;enhancing effects of thio&#8208;substituents on carbon acidity are well&#8208;documented but not explored in the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)&#8208;H acidity. The direct attachment of S&#8208;aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (kDO) for C(5)&#8208;H deprotonation by DO&#8722; base that are 2.9&#8211;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium iodide in D2O solution. Protofugalities for the N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating N&#8208;alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre&#8208;catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substitution. Detailed X&#8208;ray structural data&#8208;protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the S&#8208;aryl substituent effect origins. C(5)&#8208;H pKa values (16.9&#8211;18.6) were calculated by utilisation of experimental protofugalities.

Efficient synthesis of pyrrolidine spirooxindoles through asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of imino esters and 3&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles. DFT calculations were performed to explain the experimental findings of this study. It is demonstrated that the Michael addition step plays an importantl role in determining both the reaction rate and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of chiral heterocyclic derivatives is an important and challenging topic in the field of synthetic chemistry. In this work, a silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of glycine iminoesters with 3&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles was developed. The DTBM&#8208;Segphos&#8208;induced spirooxindole cycloaddition reaction was used to synthesize a range of stereodivergent alkyl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee), good diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and high yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational insights from DFT calculations indicate that the Michael addition step is crucial in determining the reaction rate and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Preferential Binding to a Mannoside of a Pyridine&#8211;Acetylene&#8211;Phenol Macrocycle with a Fluorine Substituent in the Cavity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrocyclic host having a fluorine atom in the recognition site. This macrocycle showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside because the fluorine atom acted as a moderate infill that prevented the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside.







Abstract
We developed a pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol macrocycle in which a fluorine atom was introduced in place of a hydroxy group, as a host for the selective binding to epimers of glucose. The fluorine atom was expected to work as a negatively charged infill repelling oxygen atoms of saccharides and prevent the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside, whose cross&#8208;section size is larger than those of the corresponding epimers, especially of a mannoside. UV&#8211;Vis and fluorescence titration experiments revealed that this host showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside. 1H NMR and molecular modeling suggested that the fluorine atom acts as a moderate infill weakening the binding to a glucoside. This result indicates that selectivity for guest molecules can be modified by replacing a hydroxy group and a hydrogen atom in host molecules with a fluorine atom.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of Oxindoles and Isoquinolinediones via the Radical Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Monoalkyl Cesium Oxalate Salts by Visible Light Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of alkylated oxindoles and isoquinolinediones were synthesized by visible light induced radical addition/cyclization reaction of N&#8208;arylacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts. This method does not contain photocatalysts, is easy to operate, and has a wide range of substrates.







Abstract
A photocatalyst&#8208;free cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts is described. In the presence of visible light and (NH4)2S2O8, monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkylated oxindoles. In addition, N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides could be applied for the cascade reaction, providing a series of alkylated isoquinolinediones, which are completely different from the products obtained with monoalkyl oxalates as substrates.

5,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides react with enol diazoacetates producing rare annulated heterocycles: oxazinooxazines and oxazinoaziridine derivatives. A switch between reaction pathways is accomplished by the amount of catalyst Rh2(Oct)4 and the order of the addition of the substrates. Both transformations show a wide substrate scope, high yields, and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Reactions of 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides with enol diazoacetates were studied. A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates. Use of Rh2(Oct)4 (2&#8197;mol.%) leads to chemoselective [3+3]&#8208;annulation producing 1,2&#8208;oxazine&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives. With lower catalyst loadings (0.03&#8197;mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in&#8197;situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.

A facile transition metal&#8208;free divergent sulfonyl amidine synthesis has been demonstrated with low reagent loading at room temperature. The sulfonyl amidine synthesis presents a wide array of thioamides derived from primary and secondary amines with different electron&#8208;deficient sulfonyl amides. Further, the protocol's utility is explored with late&#8208;stage modification of the drugs.

A convenient synthetic protocol for diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;ones with high diastereoselectivity is developed by base promoted domino annulation reaction of MBH carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The relative configurations of the various polycyclic compounds are clearly elucidated by determination eight single crystal structures.







Abstract
The diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;one scaffolds were conveniently synthesized by base promoted domino cyclization reaction of MBH (Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillmann) carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The base promoted reactions of MBH maleimides of isatins and MBH formates of isatins with 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones afforded polycyclic dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8242;&#8208;benzofuro[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:1,5]cyclopenta[1,2&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;5&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] and dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in good yields and with high diastereoselectivity. More importantly, DMAP facilitated annulation reaction of MBH nitriles of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones selectively resulted in dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopentane&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines], while Cs2CO3 promoted reaction gave dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
A fluoroalkenyl iodonium reagent with secondary amines gives selective access to two classes of fluorinated amines. Combined computational (DFT &amp; microkinetic) and experimental efforts provide guidelines for selectivity prediction. In addition, the study reveals and scrutinizes the importance of a key aminoalkyl iodonium intermediate along the diverging pathways.







Abstract
In this study, we use computations and experiments to explore mechanistic scenarios that govern the reaction between secondary amines and trifluoropropenyl iodonium triflate with the aim of rationalizing and predicting experimental outcomes. Based on the results from theory, we have compiled a list of guidelines relevant to synthetic strategies and provide examples for the interpretation of selectivities. To demonstrate the viability of these strategies, we have performed directed experiments applying different reaction conditions to obtain the products predicted by our model. Additionally, qualitative microkinetic simulations based on our computations were carried out for further support.

         <title>The Gauche&#8208;Effect in 1,2&#8208;Bis(arylsulfonate)ethanes</title>

         <dc:description>
The molecular structure of ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzenesulfonate)ethane, was elucidated, revealing a gauche&#8208;conformation through single crystal diffraction studies. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital of the sulfonate groups and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche conformation.







Abstract
With an aim of obtaining a fundamental understanding of C&#8722;C bond conformation theory, the molecular structure of an ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzene&#8208;sulfonate)ethane, was elucidated. According to the general conformation rule for alkanes, which states that molecules adopt a stabilized structure to avoid steric repulsion, ethanes typically adopt anti&#8208;conformation. However, the title compound exhibited gauche&#8208;conformation, as revealed by a single crystal diffraction study. Theoretical studies also support this behavior. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital, attributable to the sulfonate groups, and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche&#8208;conformation. The authors conclude that the sulfonate group acts as a gauche&#8208;effect synthon, which is widely applicable in organic chemistry.

Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; orbital of the sulfonate groups and the adjacent &#963;&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; orbital stabilizes the gauche conformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an aim of obtaining a fundamental understanding of C&#8722;C bond conformation theory, the molecular structure of an ethane with electron-withdrawing groups, 1,2-bis(4-methoxybenzene-sulfonate)ethane, was elucidated. According to the general conformation rule for alkanes, which states that molecules adopt a stabilized structure to avoid steric repulsion, ethanes typically adopt &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-conformation. However, the title compound exhibited &lt;i&gt;gauche&lt;/i&gt;-conformation, as revealed by a single crystal diffraction study. Theoretical studies also support this behavior. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, attributable to the sulfonate groups, and the adjacent &#963;&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; orbital stabilizes the &lt;i&gt;gauche&lt;/i&gt;-conformation. The authors conclude that the sulfonate group acts as a &lt;i&gt;gauche&lt;/i&gt;-effect synthon, which is widely applicable in organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization and Optimization of the Photoluminescent Properties of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have investigated the relationship between imidazole ring substitution in the R2&#8208;position and the blue photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines in more detail. For this purpose, a four&#8208;step synthesis was implemented and findings from previous work were extended upon. This allowed us to identify an advantageous substitution pattern to optimize the quantum yield in solution and in solid phase.







Abstract
In our previous work we could show, that Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines are compounds with interesting optical properties. In this work, we optimized the photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines by following outlined trends in our previous work. By introducing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor residual groups on the imidazole ring, the quantum yield (QY) could be significantly increased. This indicated a clear advantageous substitution pattern for this system. In addition, cyclic voltammetric and UV/vis measurements in solid state lay the foundation for applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Benzofuroxan&#8208;Based Energetic Materials with Alternating Nitro and Hydroxyl Groups: Synthesis, Characterization, and Energetic Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported the synthesis of benzofuroxan&#8208;based energetic material, 5,7&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4,6&#8208;dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole 1&#8208;oxide (DHDNBF), with alternating nitro and hydroxyl groups. A substantial improvement in thermal stability and energetic performance is observed after the dicationic salt formation.







Abstract
Due to its good stability, density and oxygen balance, the benzofuroxan fused ring framework has attracted particular attention in the field of high energy density materials. The planar structure of the benzofuroxan facilitates the straightforward derivatization with explosophores and contributes to molecular stability. In this work, a benzofuroxan scaffold was utilized to develop a highly dense energetic material, namely 5,7&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4,6&#8208;dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole 1&#8208;oxide (DHDNBF). The successive inclusion of explosophores like nitro (&#8722;NO2) and oxidative functionality like hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) on benzofuroxan resulted in an impressive density (&#961;=1.91&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and a positive oxygen balance (6.20&#8201;%) in DHDNBF (2). Furthermore, the hydroxy groups on DHDNBF enable the formation of dicationic energetic salts 3&#8211;7, contributing to additional modifications in the overall performance. Energetic salts 3, 4, and 5 exhibit significantly higher densities ranging from 1.84 (5) to 1.87 (3)&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and possess a favorable oxygen balance approaching zero or equal to zero. A marked improvement in thermal stabilities was observed in all the energetic salts (3&#8211;7) compared to their neutral counterparts, DHDNBF. Energetic salts 4 (Dv=8459&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=32.10&#8197;GPa) and 5 (Dv=8539&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=30.37&#8197;GPa) possess good energetic performance, comparable to that of well&#8208;known explosives such as LLM&#8208;105 (Dv=8560&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=33.4&#8197;GPa). Overall, the favorable characteristics of energetic salts 4 and 5 make them potential candidates for use as benzofuroxan&#8208;based secondary and primary explosives, respectively, in various military and civilian applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Mediated Fragment Library Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubsituted Cyclobutane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobutanes have attracted significant interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potential advantages in pharmacological properties. In this study a two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of cyclobutanesulfonamides with either carbamates or triazoles was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between ethenesulfonyl fluoride and tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether as the key step.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes have attracted significant interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potential advantages in pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes remain underrepresented, both in the general chemical space and in fragment&#8208;based drug discovery libraries. In this study, a two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of cyclobutanesulfonamides was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between ethenesulfonyl fluoride and tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether as the key step. The sulfonyl fluoride was subsequently transformed into various sulfonamides, whereas the tert&#8208;butyl ether was converted into carbamates and triazoles to synthesize a fragment library. Overall, this synthesis contributes to addressing the underrepresentation of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane fragments, making a valuable addition to the field of fragment&#8208;based drug discovery.

The Front Cover showcases the modernization of the Ritter reaction by photo&#8208; and electrochemical methods. Historically, carbocation intermediates in Ritter reactions are achieved under strongly acidic conditions that are functional group intolerant. The Review by C. Pratley, J.&#8197;P. Barham and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400840) describes modern radical methods to access carbocation intermediates that allow the expansion of Ritter chemistry to more complex molecules. Radical intermediates, generated photochemically or electrochemically, undergo oxidative radical polar crossover to carbocations that partake in Ritter chemistry to give amidated products. Oxidative radical polar crossover is the &#8220;knight's shining armour&#8221; (&#8220;Ritter&#8221; is German for &#8220;knight&#8221;). Image created by Sarah S. Coutts.

Recent developments demonstrate its wider application in organic synthesis. This review encourages more research in this developing field by providing an overview of photochemical techniques utilizing sulfur ylide chemistry.







Abstract
Sulfur ylides are essential reagents in various organic reactions like epoxidation and cyclopropanation. While traditionally employed in ionic chemistry, recent advancements in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis reveal their potential as sources of radicals or free carbenes. The photochemical or photocatalytic generation of reactive intermediates using sulfur ylides expands the utility of these reagents in modern organic synthesis, offering sustainable solutions to emerging challenges. Despite early demonstrations in the 1960s, the past years have witnessed a surge in photochemical methods utilizing sulfur ylides as precursors. The use of redox&#8208;active photocatalysts has facilitated numerous radical reactions. This review consolidates key findings in sulfur ylide chemistry, particularly focusing on photo&#8208;mediated reactions, to stimulate further research interest in this dynamic field.

U&#8208;PSD TREPR is a powerful time&#8208;resolved EPR technique that offers both high sensitivity and temporal resolution, making it an ideal tool for the detection of weak signals of transient radical intermediates in solution&#8208;phase chemical reactions over a wide time range. This mini review presents an overview of the innovative technique, and examples to demonstrate the significant potential of U&#8208;PSD TREPR in the field of radical chemistry and photocatalysis







Abstract
Radical chemistry is an important research field that plays a vital role in life science, material science, and energy conversions. However, directly visualizing the transient open&#8208;shell intermediates unambiguously in radical chemistry is a significant and long&#8208;standing challenge. Recently, we have developed an innovative ultrawide single&#8208;sideband phase&#8208;sensitive detection (U&#8208;PSD) time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) technique, which enables the characterization of diverse transient radical intermediates and mechanistic studies close to reaction conditions. In this brief review, we will offer an outline of the principles underlying our U&#8208;PSD TREPR technique, and present examples highlighting the technique's ability to accurately characterize and track free radical intermediates in photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;and Electrochemical Modification of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins through Cysteine: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for the modification of cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed. Additionally, the current limitations of these methods and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future are also explored.







Abstract
Chemical modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as an efficient strategy to study and manipulate the physical and chemical properties and biological functionalities of proteins. Among the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine is one of the most frequently targeted residues for chemical modification of peptides and proteins due to its unique thiol group and its relatively low natural abundance. Cysteine is able to partake in radical and atom&#8208;, electron&#8208; and hydride&#8208;transfer reactions taking the benefit of redox activity of thiol side chain. Recently, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry have emerged as influential methodologies for enabling novel transformations in organic synthesis. These two fields both involve the generation of radical intermediates through single electron transfer processes, which align well with the redox activity of cysteine residue. Furthermore, the mild and controllable features are suitable for solving the chemo&#8208; and regioselective problems of the existing bioconjugation strategies. Given the intrinsic benefits of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis, the application of developing novel cysteine&#8208;based bioconjugation methods is increasingly compelling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for modifying cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed. Additionally, the current limitations of these methods and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future are also explored.

         <dc:description>
Intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, with advantages associated with a metal&#8208;free approach. This review summarises the development of intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertions and highlights the benefits of recent advances in technology which have revolutionised the potential for use of photochemical transformations in synthesis, overcoming many of the traditional challenges associated with synthetic photochemistry.







Abstract
Intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. While there are limitations in the scope of C&#8722;H bonds amenable to C&#8722;H insertion under photochemical conditions relative to metal catalysed C&#8722;H insertions, the benefits of conducting these synthetically powerful transformations in a metal&#8208;free approach offers &#8220;green&#8221; advantages. Recent advances in technology have revolutionised the potential for use of photochemical transformations in synthesis, including the wavelength control enabled by LEDs and the benefits associated with continuous flow processing which overcome many of the traditional challenges associated with synthetic photochemistry including scale&#8208;up. The potential for telescoping the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds and downstream photochemical reactions is clear. This review summarises the development of intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertions and highlights the benefits of recent technological advances.

Gold, in contrast to other transition metals, offers a unique reactivity profile and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This review will focus on recent advances in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, particularly those facilitated by photocatalysts and ligand design.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki and Heck reactions are two of the most common carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions. Gold, unlike other transition metals (Pd, Ni, and Cu), offers unique reactivity profiles, and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This mini&#8208;review focused on the recent work in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, especially by photocatalysts or ligand design, which show reactivities and features distinct from other transition metals. These discoveries will further facilitate the development of gold redox catalysis as well as applications in organic synthesis, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking back, looking forward: this Review aims to retrace the evolutionary pathway of the Ritter reaction from 2010 to present. In particular, the most recent available strategies that involve the merging of radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) and Ritter&#8208;type processes are presented. The new possibilities offered, such as broadening the precursor pool and pivotal roles of additives, will be emphasized.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8722;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8722;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction as well as reimagining the process with novel mechanisms and additives.

         <title>Utilization of Hypervalent Bonds as a Novel Strategy for Manipulating Energy Levels of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique optical properties created by the combination of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing effects to &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The hypervalent compounds have a narrow energy gap for NIR emission and stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements.







Abstract
The unique optical properties created by the combination of azobenzene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing effects to the directly attached &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The resulting hypervalent compounds have a dramatically narrow energy gap showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission despite the limited size of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. In addition, the hypervalent compounds also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements in both crystals and &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer films. We also explain that the nature of hypervalent bonds depends on the element type, which is particularly effective in bringing out the properties of heavy elements. In this review, we describe that the use of hypervalent bonds is a novel strategy not only for manipulating the energy levels of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system but also for developing a variety of functional materials based on the newly rising properties from hypervalent element.

         <title>Denitrative Functionalization of Nitroarenes: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 45, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroarenes can be readily synthesized from arenes through direct nitration, and their functionalization via C&#8722;NO2 bond cleavage offers a rapid approach for the modification of arenes. The method not only streamlines the synthetic routes but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;H bonds. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
Nitroarenes are fundamental feedstocks in the chemical industry. Their relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond allows for late&#8208;stage modifications of molecules and exhibits complete orthogonality to the reactivity of C&#8208;halogen bond in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes holds significant appeal due to it avoids the use of aryl halides, thereby simplifying reaction steps and improving atom and step economy. Recent progress in direct denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes includes palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, copper&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, as well as metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot C&#8722;NO2 functionalization. In this review, we provide a concise overview of these advancements, detailing the reaction features and mechanisms. This summary aims to highlight the versatility and efficiency of denitrative functionalization methodologies, offering insights into their potential applications and inspiring further research in this promising area of organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>A simple, efficient, metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly approach for the C3&#8208;H regioselective chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed by using diphenyl dichalcogenides and iodine as support in green solvent PEG&#8208;400 under ambient temperature and aerobic condition. Furthermore, chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone has also been accomplished in similar conditions. The proposed mechanism is based on the control experiments and suggests an ionic pathway. The reaction offers a green synthetic path with a high yield, and the methodology is crucially significant due to its operational simplicity, convenient execution, scalability, and tolerance of various functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.e. 90% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9:1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building blocks derived from tyrosine N&#8208;oxime have been used to construct natural products. We report the synthesis of nine halogenated tyrosine N&#8208;oxime derivatives reminiscent of biosynthetic precursors. Full conversion was ensured by the addition of p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TsOH) for monohalogenation and a key oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence using excess N&#8208;bromo, N&#8208;chloro, or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NBS, NCS, NIS) to provide dihalogenated derivatives.







Abstract
Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71&#8201;%, 50&#8211;53&#8201;%, and 78&#8211;80&#8201;% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8211;76&#8201;%, 54&#8211;56&#8201;%, 79&#8211;80&#8201;%). This strategy was extended to synthesize hetero&#8208;dihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8211;77&#8201;%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.

A series of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives bearing multiple functional groups were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies indicated that the reaction proceeds via a proton transfer followed by ring opening and ring formation to produce the target product.

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Hydroxylation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids. This review summarizes the representative methods over the past decade. The paper categorizes these methods based on the types of catalysts employed, encompassing a range of metal catalysts and non&#8208;metal catalysts, as well as other reaction types of catalyst&#8208;free.







Abstract
Hydroxylated compounds represent a significant and diverse class of substances in the field of chemistry. These compounds play critical roles in various chemical reactions and are essential components in numerous industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds, especially those derived from boronic acids. The synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids typically involves the utilization of various types of catalysts, which are essential for enhancing reaction rates and selectivity, including metal catalysts such as CuFe&#8322;O&#8324;, Cu@C&#8323;N&#8324;, AgNPs, and Ti0.97Ni0.3O1.97, as well as non&#8208;metal catalysts like polycaprolactone (PCL), TFB&#8208;BMTH COF materials, C70, and graphene oxide (GO). These catalytic reactions often require the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) or molecular oxygen, which serve as critical reagents in the hydroxylation process. In certain cases, organic bases act as electron donors to propel the reaction. Furthermore, some studies have reported oxidative hydroxylation reactions that are catalyst&#8208;free.This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and breakthroughs in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids, with a particular focus on research conducted from 2014 to 2024.

         <title>A General Protocol for the Aqueous Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction between Cyclic Enones and 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general methodology for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction of cycloenones and a variety of di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds. The methodology involves the use of a bifunctional Lewis base as catalyst in aqueous medium at room temperature. The synthetic applicability of the polyfunctionalized MBH adducts is demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.







Abstract
In this report, we present an extensive methodological study of the aqueous Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of a range of cycloenones with di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto esters, 1,2&#8208;diketones, diethyl ketomalonate, ninhydrin, acenaphthenequinone, and phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, through mediation of a bicyclic imidazolyl alcohol (BIA) as catalyst in aqueous medium. The desired MBH adducts were obtained in up to 98&#8201;% yield. The synthetic applicability of the MBH adducts was demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.

The methodology involves the use of a bifunctional Lewis base as catalyst in aqueous medium at room temperature. The synthetic applicability of the polyfunctionalized MBH adducts is demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole derivative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this report, we present an extensive methodological study of the aqueous Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of a range of cycloenones with di- and tricarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic &#945;-keto esters, 1,2-diketones, diethyl ketomalonate, ninhydrin, acenaphthenequinone, and phenanthrene-9,10-dione, through mediation of a bicyclic imidazolyl alcohol (BIA) as catalyst in aqueous medium. The desired MBH adducts were obtained in up to 98&#8201;% yield. The synthetic applicability of the MBH adducts was demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole derivative.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in C&#8208;N bond Formation via N&#8208;centered Radicals from N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, which facilitates many useful and challenging transformations, particularly in the formation of C&#8211;N bonds. In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community. This review comprehensively includes all the significant advances in C&#8211;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been developed for the synthesis of allenes using propargyl electrophiles and various nucleophiles. However, the construction of allenes through reductive cross&#8208;coupling remains a challenging topic. This paper presents a strategy for synthesizing multisubstituted allenes through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The method employs propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to generate a range of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are mild, and the process exhibits high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, along with good substrate universality. Moreover, the method can be extended to chlorogermane and chlorostannane, leading to the formation of germanium or stannium substituted allenes. This study provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes and expands the synthetic toolbox for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>From Enzyme Encapsulation to Environmental Solutions: Photostable Laccase in DOPC Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.
Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post&#8208;irradiation compared to the free enzyme.
In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, the simplicity and ease of large&#8208;scale production of multilamellar vesicles present an advantageous option for various applications, including bioremediation.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactive nature. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes for the generation of acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss some of the key advancements in the past 6 years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their utilization. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Gem&#8208;Difluoroallylic Ketones Formation via Selective Carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) Bond Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;Ketone Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

         <title>S&#8208;Nucleophilic Imidazoline Ring Expansion: a Novel Approach to the Formation of Medium&#8208;Sized Thiolactames</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the formation of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles with a thioamide moiety has been developed. This is based on the expansion reaction of the imidazole ring under the action of an S&#8208;nucleophile.







Abstract
A novel method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles containing thioamide groups. This approach facilitates the expansion of the imidazoline moiety within the condensed ring system through the action of S&#8208;nucleophiles, enabling access to a broader and more diverse chemical space for natural product analogs and bioactive compounds. A series of [1,4,7]thia&#8208;(oxa&#8722;)diazecin&#8208;9&#8208;thiones were efficiently synthesized from diarene&#8208;fused [1.4]heteroazepines using this transformation, achieving yields ranging from 28&#8211;58&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concurrent installation of C&#8208;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8208;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8208;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8208;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Sustainable Total Synthesis and Chiral Pool Strategies with Emphasis on (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol in Natural Products Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. In fact, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a critical and comprehensive review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the synthesis of natural products through diverse synthetic routes employing (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt. Additionally, newly developed catalysts and synthetic protocols using (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol amongst their substrates scope are also analyzed and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioslective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactives heterocycles by using various C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;S and C&#8208;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Acid&#8208;free Homogeneous Catalytic Systems for the Ester Products Synthesis by Alkenes Alkoxycarbonylation: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxycarbonylation represents a method for the ester products synthesis from available reagents &#8211; unsaturated compounds, alcohols, and CO. The beginning of research on this reaction was laid in W. Reppe&#8217; &#160;works in 1953. In early works, halides and carbonyls of Co, Ni, Rh, and Ir were used as catalysts, and alkoxycarbonylation was often complicated by the unsaturated compounds hydroformylation or alcohol carbonylation. In recent decades, in the presence of the most active and selective Pd&#8208;phosphine systems with strong protonic acids, the products are typically only isomeric esters, which corresponds to the creating waste&#8208;free production principles. At present, a large&#8208;capacity synthesis process for methyl methacrylate, dubbed Alpha, is in operation, with the initial stage being ethylene methoxycarbonylation. In light of these developments, there is a growing interest among chemists and technologists in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation. &#160;The use of strong protonic acids as co&#8208;catalysts is essential for the formation of active catalytic complexes. However, these acids are highly corrosive and can cause the alkenes isomerisation. This review is devoted to the analysis of acid&#8208;free homogeneous Pd&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;catalysts employed in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation over the past 15 years. As a result, polymers, monomers and other valuable linear and branched esters were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Reductive N&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Carboxylic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent, achieving up to 90&#8201;% yield and broad functional group tolerance. It has been successfully applied to synthesize cariprazine, an antipsychotic drug, showcasing its potential in complex amine synthesis.







Abstract
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent. The direct amidation of esters with amines and t&#8208;BuMgCl generates the intermediate amides. Subsequently, without the need for isolation or purification, these intermediates reacted with Red&#8208;Al in the same reaction flask to generate amines up to 90&#8201;% yield. This process is characterized by the rapid reaction time, quantitative conversion, and broad ester scope with various functional groups. Notably, this method enables the successful transformation of amine with carboxylic esters to produce cariprazine, a pivotal antipsychotic drug substance.

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/ hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives involving in situ sulfur dioxide insertion is established. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and in situ formed corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. In addition, this reaction goes through once selective cleavage of &#963; carbon&#8208;carbon bond and following successively formation of three new chemical bonds, in which cyano group acts as the dual roles, including the radical acceptor and carbonyl source.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone, skipping the stepwise synthesis. The thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized &#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Isoxazolone&#8208;Based Bisspiroheterocyclic Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines is reported, which provides an efficient access to spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazolone derivatives bearing CF3 group and quaternary carbon stereocenters in good to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A strategic approach to incorporate CF3 group into oxindoles, pyrrolidines, and isoxazolones to construct spiro heterocyclic skeletons with quaternary carbon stereocenters was developed. Using a DMAP catalyst under mild conditions, the controllable synthesis of spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazoline derivatives was achieved via concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines. This method exhibits robust regioselectivity and provides a series of isoxazolone&#8208;based bispiro heterocycles in good to high yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (in all cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), offering new candidate compounds for drug screen.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescence active ligand system consisting of a BODIPY derivative, linked to a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl coordinating moiety via alkyl or benzyl spacers, is presented. The designed ligands exhibit remarkable emission properties even in solid state, which is complemented by crystal structure analysis. This enables future application of the ligands in various fields of coordination chemistry including spin&#8208;crossover photoluminescence coupled systems.







Abstract
Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8211;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n=1&#8211;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions. Photophysical studies revealed high fluorescence quantum yields (69 &#8211; 95&#8201;%) in solution for the &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208; bridged ligand 3 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) and the &#8208;(CH2)3&#8208; bridged ligand 4 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene). Non&#8208;radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208; and/or &#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208; moiety for 2 and 1 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[4&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)phenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety and a spacer in meso&#8208;position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.

Non-radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H-tetrazol-1-yl- and/or -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- moiety for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-[4-((1H-tetrazol-1-yl)methyl)phenyl]-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H-tetrazol-1-yl moiety and a spacer in &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first total synthesis of a glycolipid, deinococcucin A, isolated from a gut bacterium, member of extremophilic Deinococcus family. The synthesis started from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, a sugar arising from chitin biomass, major constituent of crustacean's shell. The major difficulty was the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide moiety linked in alpha anomeric position of GlcNAc, which was efficiently obtained from the corresponding allyl group.







Abstract
Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetrically Fused Nanographene&#8208;Porphyrin Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyl, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) fragments are assembled around a central porphyrin core and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve the merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing optical features.







Abstract
A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Preliminary In&#8208;Vitro Activity of 6&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl &#946;&#8208;Carboline Derivatives for the Development of Drug Conjugates Targeting MDM2</title>

         <dc:description>
The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. A series of MDM2 inhibitors based on a &#946;&#8208;carboline scaffold and containing a functionalized alkyl chain of variable length at the 6&#8208;position, was synthesized, docked in the active site of MDM2 protein and tested for antiproliferative activity towards U87MG glioblastoma cell line







Abstract
The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein, the main downregulator of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. However, the lack of selectivity and poor effectiveness in tumors bearing mutated&#8208;p53 impaired the approval of several MDM2 inhibitors for the market. In this context, the possibility of generating drug&#8208;conjugates within a MDM2 inhibitor is a growing research area aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Considering the promising MDM2 inhibition by the &#946;&#8208;carboline&#8208;based 1, in this work we explored the introduction of a new functionalization on it for a future conjugation while preserving its anticancer properties. Based on preliminary docking studies, we synthesized derivatives 2&#8201;a&#8211;d having linear hydroxyalkyl chains with different lengths at the 6&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;carboline core, which effectively preserved the submicromolar IC50 on wild&#8208;type&#8208;p53&#8208;U87MG glioblastoma cell line observed with 1. Candidates 2&#8201;a, d showed the functionalization was tolerated with respect of bioactivity also on mutated&#8208;p53&#8208;U138MG glioblastoma cell line, and their hydroxyl groups proved to be easily accessible when coupled to 4&#8208;pentynoic&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine affording derivatives 10&#8201;a, d with high yields. In summary, our results led to generating novel 6&#8208;hydroxyalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline compounds displaying a suitable hydroxyl&#8208;site useful to improve the efficacy and/or the tumor specificity of 1 through conjugation strategies.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dioxane as Precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;: A Simple and Convenient Strategy to Synthesize 1,2&#8208;Disulfide Substituted Ethanes Initiated by Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved via the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4&#8208;dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane generated in&#8208;situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented I2&#8208;initiated nucleophilic ring opening reaction of 1,4&#8208;dioxane with thiols for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes has been developed. Previously, dihalogenated ethane, acetylene or ethylene are often used as the pre&#8208;cursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;. Through the cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, 1,4&#8208;dioxane as precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved for the first time. In the presence of HI, thiols could be replaced by disulfides as nucleophile. This protocol is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

         <title>Exploring the reactivity of (hetero)aryl amides in the Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction with arylalkenyl boron reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides is explored in the formation of a C&#8211;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides. The products obtained were applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via Heck reaction as proof of concept, illustrating the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides.







Abstract
The unique reactivity and stability of enamides make them attractive reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we investigated the reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides in the formation of a C&#8722;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction using arylalkenyl boron&#8208;based reagents yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl enamides with an E configuration. The products obtained have been applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, an important scaffold in several biologically active compounds, via sequential Heck reaction to prove the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl enamides.

         <title>Immobilized Eosin Y on Modified Silica Nanoparticles and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized, functionalized with amino groups and covalently linked to Eosin Y (EY) through amide bonds. The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was characterized by microscospy and spectroscopy techniques. It displayed efficient photocatalytic activity in oxidation, reduction, and energy transfer reactions, demonstrating its potential as a heterogeneous photocatalyst with superior catalytic performance compared to its homogeneous counterpart.







Abstract
The development of novel photocatalytic systems is crucial for advancing sustainable chemical processes in organic synthesis. In this study, we report the preparation, characterization, and application of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on Eosin Y (EY) covalently immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including SEM, TEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and DLS. These analyses confirmed the successful immobilization of EY on SNPs and demonstrated the uniformity and favourable photophysical properties of the resulting hybrid material. The photocatalytic performance of SNPs&#8208;EY was evaluated in a series of model reactions, including aza&#8208;Henry reaction (cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling), reduction of nitrocompounds, and photooxidation of dimethylanthracene. The reaction results demonstrated that SNPs&#8208;EY is an effective and recyclable photocatalyst, offering yields comparable to or higher than those of homogeneous systems, while providing the advantages of easy separation and reuse. This study highlights the potential of SNPs&#8208;EY as a versatile photocatalyst for various organic transformations, promoting the advancement of green and sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Application of Laser&#8208;Generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) Furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal&#8208;support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal&#8208;support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>

The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+3)&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Mercaptobenzimidazoles With &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Styrene Under Ultrasonic Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol developed (3+3)&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene under ultrasonic irradiation. The cyclized product was formed through the Michael addition and intramolecular substitution reaction successively. The pure products were obtained with simple recrystallization.







Abstract
A rapid and facile sonochemical route for the [3+3] annulation of 2&#8208;mercapto benzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene was reported for the synthesis of fluorinated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]thiazines. The reaction proceeds through the SN2/SNV pathway while the selective SN2 pathway is completely inhibited. The developed method is effective with a wide range of substrates, tolerating diverse functional groups. The pure products are obtained with high yield (up to 92&#8201;%) directly via recrystallization without column chromatography. Furthermore, applying sonochemical methodology reduces the reaction time and eliminates the need for expensive photocatalysts, ligands or oxidants.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Physical Properties of ExTTF Substituted with Aryl Groups through Sulfur Bridges and the Electron Transfers with C60</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four molecular tweezers with good electron donor ability were synthesized and fully characterized. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption studies showed that intermolecular electron transfer existed between compounds 1&#8211;4 and C60.







Abstract
ExTTF derivatives (1&#8211;4) bearing aryl groups attached through sulfur bridges have been synthesized. The peripheral aryl groups have a certain influence on both the electronic and crystallographic properties of the exTTFs. Compounds 1&#8211;4 show two bands typical of exTTF derivatives near 360 and 430&#8197;nm. Compound 1 and 4 exhibit the characteristic electrochemical exTTF behavior, with one reversible two&#8208;electron process ranging depending on their substitution the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability. But 2 and 3 exhibit a similar single two&#8208;electron oxidation wave but electrochemically irreversible redox with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak potential separation. And 3 has a low redox potential, which is significantly inconsistent with the electron absorption of pyridine substituents. The crystal structures of 1&#8211;4 exhibit the characteristic butterfly shape. Moreover, the peripheral aryl groups exhibit multiple alignment modes with respect to the central exTTF core, caused by their rotation about the two C&#8722;S bonds of the sulfur bridges. Under the interaction of multiple molecules, exTTF shows different molecular packing structures. Compounds 1&#8211;4 have charge transfer with C60 due to their good electron&#8208;donating ability, butterfly configuration, and free rotation of peripheral aryl groups. These results indicate that 1&#8211;4 organic electronic materials have potential applications in the field of supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Photochemical Reactions of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. This paper provides an overview of organic transformations achieved through metal and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts or even without the necessity of photocatalysts from 2019 to 2024.







Abstract
The adoption of clean and renewable light sources is becoming increasingly prevalent in organic synthesis due to their welfare, workability and economic benefits. In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. Since harmful or polluting reagents are not needed for the organic photochemical reactions, these reactions provide insights into sustainable processes and green chemistry. N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds (NHC's) constitute fundamental structural motifs in numerous organic compounds and are widely encountered in natural products and pharmaceuticals with diverse biological activities. Consequently, investigations into the synthesis and modification of these NHC's such as indole, carbazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline and pyridine hold particular significance for chemists and pharmacologists. This review provides an overview of the impact of photocatalysis on synthesis of NHC's and their modification from 2019 to 2024. These transformations are achieved through the utilization of both metal photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Ir, Pd, Co, Gd etc.) and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Eosin&#8208;Y, 4CzIPN, Mes&#8208;Acr+ClO4&#8722; etc.), or even without the necessity of photocatalysts. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers delving into the promising realm of photocatalyzed transformations.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8208;B bond in a range of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.</dc:description>

Additionally, the review discusses the underlying mechanisms involved in the degradation process and addresses the challenges that remain in this field.







Abstract
Plastics play a crucial role in the survival and advancement of human civilization. However, the increasing challenge of plastic pollution presents significant obstacles. Disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling result in substantial resource wastage and pose potential environmental hazards. The slow progress in recycling and reusing waste plastics hinders their industrial application and effective response to environmental crises. Photocatalysis offers promising solutions for the future of plastic recycling, particularly with the recent increase in photocatalytic degradation methods for polystyrene (PS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the photooxidation of PS into high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <dc:description>
A convenient method for the N&#8208;modification of NH&#8208;tetrazoles by the Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of diazocarbonyl compounds into the N&#8208;H bond has been proposed. A wide scope of structurally diverse diazo reagents as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
A convenient method for the N&#8208;modification of NH&#8208;tetrazoles by the Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of diazocarbonyl compounds into the N&#8722;H bond has been proposed. A wide range of structurally diverse diazo reagents (including heterocyclic ones) as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity. It is shown that the regioselectivity of the reaction can decrease in the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the tetrazole, as well as in the presence of protic acids.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we have reported a reaction that allows performing a Knoevenagel condensation, its adduct reduction, and subsequent decarboxylation in a single preparative step using cheap, stable, and convenient sodium hypophosphite. No metal catalyst is required. The reaction is scalable. The limitations of the method are also described in the paper.







Abstract
Saturated carbon chain elongation is a common refrain in numerous synthetic pathways. While the formation of C&#8722;C single bonds is of primary importance in organic synthesis, the simultaneous introduction of functional groups such as nitrile or ester can reasonably increase its practical utility for the preparation of multifunctional products. The Knoevenagel reaction is a powerful tool to create carbon backbones of organic molecules; however, it requires subsequent reduction and/or decarboxylation to achieve a product with a saturated carbon chain. Herein we report a convenient one&#8208;step protocol for the reductive condensation between methyl cyanoacetate and aldehydes in the presence of stable, ecologically benign, cheap and available in bulk amounts sodium hypophosphite as a reductant. A description of both the reaction capabilities and limitations is given in this paper.

         <title>Construction of Sulfur(IV)&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric (4+2) Dipolar Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) cyclization was disclosed, providing a modular platform for the synthesis of chiral sulfur(IV)&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.







Abstract
Chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds play an important role in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral pharmaceuticals, and chiral materials. While great progress has been made in the synthesis of these compounds, the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles remains relatively limited compared to acyclic ones. In this study, we successfully report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of structurally diverse chirality&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur(IV) six&#8208;membered heterocycles under mild conditions via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) dipolar cyclization. More importantly, these products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction has been developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. This oxidant&#8208;free protocol offers several other advantages, including low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity.







Abstract
We have realized a photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be readily accomplished.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through hydrogenation, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reduction leads to structurally complex and highly functionalized scaffolds. Results from preliminary sperm motility assays underscore the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.







Abstract
We describe the derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through simple transformations, including catalytic hydrogenations, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reductions. Despite being structurally complex and highly functionalized, the novel compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in sperm motility assays, underscoring the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.

         <dc:description>
Aryl pinacol boronates generate aryl radicals under aqueous conditions. The formed aryl radicals can be used to functionalize peptide disulfides yielding&#160;S&#8208;arylated products, but they react readily with proteins as well competing with Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling used in bioorthogonal chemical biology applications. The overall reaction does not rely on metal, electro&#8208; or photocatalysis, and reflects the tunable Lewis acidity of organoboronates.







Abstract
We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages the versatile reactivity of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from the accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular [5+2] Cycloaddition: Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Allene&#8208;Containing 2&#8208;Benzoxepines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines has been developed on the basis of palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition. The synthetic approach features ready substrate availability, broad substrate scope, satisfactory yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition of propargylic carbonates with benzyl allenyl ethers has been developed for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines. The reaction proceeds by a pathway involving decarboxylative allenylpalladium formation, regioselective intermolecular insertion, and intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In this way, the sequential formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds results in the generation of a 2&#8208;benzoxepine skeleton in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime complexes catalyze highly diastereoselective radical cyclopropanation of olefins with &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates under mild conditions and low catalyst loading. A broad substrate scope including biologically active molecules is tolerated with high yields. This method is also amenable for gram&#8208;scale reactions, showcasing the application of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed metalloradical catalysis (MRC) in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>Xanthone Synthesis through Catalysis: Exploring the Green Limits of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advancements in the synthesis of xanthones, focusing on the transition from stoichiometric to catalytic methodologies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches. Key environmental metrics, solvent selection, and reaction steps, among others, are analysed, showcasing the potential of modern catalytic techniques to develop greener synthetic processes.







Abstract
The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in by&#8208;products and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.

Herein, we report an efficient scandium&#8208;catalytic reaction protocol for the classical Fischer indole synthesis, which can tolerate a wide variety of polycyclic substrates and allow us to easily construct complex indole structures in high yields for most cases. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the reaction efficacy, we also synthesized two quinazolinone&#8208;containing natural alkaloids, their analog, as well as an anticancer indenoindolone compound.

Using &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones and acetylenedicarboxylate as the respective reactive partners, the [5+1] and [5+2] cycloaddition reactions with isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates facilitate the construction of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazine and seven&#8208;membered N, S&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks under mild conditions. This cycloaddition approach exhibits exceptional substrate versatility and tolerance towards diverse functional groups.







Abstract
Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5+1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5+2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;Diarylation of Isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxylate by Double C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

         <title>Structurally Innovative Benzimidazole&#8208;fused Ionic Organoselenium Compounds: Prevalence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N/Se Chalcogen Bonds with the Selenocyanate Receptor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen Bond. Presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se chalcogen bonds are highlighted in the structurally innovative benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates, cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed the participation of both N and Se atoms of the SeCN counterions as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8211;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8211;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8211;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, surface electrostatic potential (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.

         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.







Abstract
An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Axially Diaryl Aldehydes by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Desymmetrization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides with purported anti&#8208;Alzheimer's activity, utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages.







Abstract
Sodium oligomannate, a sophisticated mixture of acidic linear &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;oligomannurarate ranging from dimers to decamers with an average molecular weight of 670&#8764;880&#8197;Da, has gained conditional approval for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8211;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.

         <title>Filling the Gap within 10&#8208;Membered Heteroenediynes: Thiaenediyne &#8211; An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiaenediyne, as a member of the heteroenediynes fused to a benzothiophene core, was synthesized using the S&#8208;type Nicholas cyclization. NBO analysis was used to demonstrate the primary role of the heteroatom in an enediyne core for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization.







Abstract
The heteroatom nature in 10&#8208;membered enediynes plays a crucial role in tuning of their reactivity in the Bergman cyclization, which is a decisive factor for the biological activity of enediynes. Although benzothiophene&#8208;fused O&#8208; and N&#8208;enediynes have been identified as promising biological objects, the corresponding thiaenediyne remains unknown. To fill this gap, we synthesized the thiaanalog and studied it in both practical and theoretical terms. While the Nicholas reaction has proven to be an effective cyclization technique for the preparation of heteroenediynes, in the case of thiaenediyne it was accompanied by an unusual acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization, forming a thiepinium salt. The S&#8208;enediyne has reduced reactivity in the Bergman cyclization relative to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;enediynes, attributed to the diminished alkyne bending and extended cd&#8208;distance. The NBO analysis of the entire series, namely the evaluation of &#960;in/out(C2&#8208;CC)&#8594;&#963;*(C&#8722;X) hyperconjugation, revealed that the S atom in S&#8208;enediyne provides stronger stabilization of the initial compound than the N atom in N&#8208;enediyne, while exhibiting the weakest stabilization of the Bergman cyclization transition state. NICS values were employed to examine the change in aromaticity along the Bergman cyclization coordinate. This approach, in conjunction with the NBO analysis, provides a foundation for further rational design of unnatural enediynes.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

         <title>Tunable and Selective Transformation of Aromatic Thioether Enabled by Regulating Active Species Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the effective regulation of active species, the controllable upgrading transformations of aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions have been achieved by a pyridinium photocatalyst, which are ROS&#8208;dominated aerobic oxidation and the chlorine radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, revealing the great potential of pyridinium molecules in photocatalytic field.







Abstract
Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8901;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8722;S bond activation and cleavage.

         <title>Structural Modifications on Dopamine Molecules toward Polydopamine Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the structural modifications of dopamine in the organic chemistry level to enhance polydopamine (PDA) coatings. By altering the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, researchers aim to improve PDA's adhesive properties and expand its applicability across various surfaces. The study highlights the significance of these modifications in optimizing PDA for diverse applications.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic material synthesized through the oxidative self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. This material emulates the adhesive properties of mussel foot proteins, allowing the formation of robust and stable organic coatings on various surfaces. Researchers have attempted to identify and improve the surface&#8208;coating properties of PDA by incorporating additional organic functional groups. This review explores the structural modifications of dopamine molecules at the organic chemistry level, with a focus on changes in the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, and examines their impact on the applications of PDA. The flexibility of these modifications underscores their importance for optimizing PDA coatings for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent Thiazole Fused Benzo[a] Carbazoles by Sunlight Driven Photocyclization of Indolylthiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles has been reported for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles. The Key features of this method include the use of sun light as the source of energy, catalyst&#8208;free conditions and presence of medicinally important thiazole and carbazole moieties. Most of these synthesized products show very good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time a sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles, for the synthesis of highly fluorescent thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles using a mixture of solvents (CH3CN: DMSO; 3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Ring opening of indole moiety was observed in the case of thiazole derivatives having 2&#8208;methyl indole substituents. Under similar reaction conditions, photocyclization of trisubstituted thiazoles having cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls in place of indole moiety also worked. This reaction provides products having two medicinally important moieties thiazole and benzocarbazoles. We have studied the photophysical properties of all the products and found that most of the synthesized products have very good fluorescence quantum yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Synthesis of Pyrazolo&#8208;Sulfonamide: Impact of Solvent on Nitro&#8208;Pyrazole Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.







Abstract
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent method for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. The reaction exhibits notable solvent effects in pyrazole's reactivity. The ionic liquid DBU&#8208;AcOH triggered the reactivity of 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;pyrazole, whereas the reaction in PEG proceeded selectively at the 3&#8208; &amp; 5&#8208;positions of pyrazole. Key applications of this method include the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamide, sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]Thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. This review summarizes the developments in the construction of benzo[b]thiophene skeletons from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles by electrophilic and radical cyclization reactions.







Abstract
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.

         <title>Syntheses and Properties of Two Isomeric Phenanthroacephenanthrylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the syntheses and properties of two phenanthroacephenanthrylene regioisomers as the new non&#8208;alternant cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic analogs of alternant dibenzoperylene polyaromatics.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Chiral Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active aziridines represent an important class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclics because they are privileged structural frameworks in biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products. This review is to summarize complementary assembly of optically active aziridines in recent years, as well as their applications in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine&#8208;based rigid and three&#8208;dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories: (1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three-membered nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine-based rigid and three-dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials.

         <title>The Catalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Aryl Acetic Acids by Late&#8208;Stage Bromination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;bromination of aryl acetic acids via an enediolate intermediate is presented. This method yields a variety of aryl acetic acids with yields ranging from 19&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%, including three examples of dibrominated products. Furthermore, the reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale, and several transformations of the resulting products have been performed.







Abstract
We report a catalytic late&#8208;stage bromination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl acetic acid. The aryl acetic acid was transformed into enediolate in the presence of an (AcO)4B2O with the combination of DBU, and consequently underwent an electrophilic bromination reaction with pyridinium tribromide. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;bromo aryl acetic acids were isolated in yields of 19&#8211;65&#8201;%. In addition, the reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and several transformations of the products were carried out.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established via nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines.







Abstract
An atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established by organocatalytic nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines, providing a straightforward way to achieve the expected C&#8722;N atropisomers in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) from readily available starting materials. Furthermore, axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole derivatives could be prepared upon oxidative aromatization of the corresponding N&#8208;arylindolines.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
