         <title>Homogeneous Systems Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes for Photoactivated CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, homogeneous earth&#8208;abundant systems that can photoactivate CO2 reduction by means of visible light are reported. In particular, advances on this topic of the past five years (2017&#8211;2021) are reviewed.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 into advantageous chemicals is a noteworthy pathway to close the carbon cycle and decrease carbon footprint. The use of visible light and ultimately solar radiation is extremely interesting in managing energy issues. Similarly, the employment of cost&#8208;effective materials guides to environmentally friendly applications. This Review addresses the homogeneous systems used for photoactivated the CO2 reduction in the last years, highlighting the earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based components. Besides those systems composed only of noble metal&#8208;free units, hybrid systems, also containing a noble metal&#8208;based complex, are also examined, revealing that research needs to increase the attention on more sustainable alternatives.

         <title>Light as a Tool in Organic Photocatalysis: Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation and Chromoselective Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes recent advancements in photocatalysis related to the applications of light as a tool for controlling the reactions selectivity and reactivity. The concepts and applications of multi&#8208;photon excitation photoredox catalysis and chromoselective catalysis in organic synthesis are discussed.







Abstract
Over the past decades, photoredox catalysis has developed to the big mature field of chemistry. Especially in the field of organic synthesis, more and more sustainable alternatives to conventional synthesis are being developed. Nonetheless, most research activities are focused on the development of new synthetic pathways, utilizing photons as a source of energy for breaking and building of new chemical bonds. We discuss here cases, where selection of the irradiation mode, light intensity (one&#8208;, two&#8208; photons) or wavelength (UV, blue, green) has a crucial role on the outcome of the photocatalytic event. Thus, control over irradiation conditions influence the reaction mechanism and offers an access to highly reactive species that are otherwise hardly available. This allows for the unique chemical events to happen, such as deep reduction reactions. The principles of these concepts and their applications are reviewed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

The present manuscript demonstrates a convenient strategy for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione from quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one using TBN (tert&#8208;Butyl nitrite). The reaction proceeded via TBN mediated C&#8208;3 nitration of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one followed by hydroxylation with water (moisture) via ipso&#8208;substitution.







Abstract
A convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione has been achieved by C&#8722;H hydroxylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one using TBN (tert&#8208;butyl nitrite) as a promoter of the reaction in DMSO. First radical&#8208;mediated nitration using TBN at C&#8208;3 of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one and followed by hydroxylation with water via ipso&#8208;substitution led to the quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Deoxydifluoromethylthiolation of Activated Aliphatic Alcohols with BT&#8722;SCF2H</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 18, May 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
BT&#8722;SCF2H was employed in a deoxygenative difluoromethylthiolation of benzylic and other activated alcohols. The presence of AgOTf as a catalyst was found to be crucial for stabilizing the &#8722;SCF2H anion. To the best of our knowledge, this process is the first report of a direct nucleophilic substitution reaction involving &#8722;SCF2H and delivers valuable difluoromethylthio&#8208;substituted products from readily available alcohols.







Abstract
Deoxygenative conversion of alcohols into difluoromethylthioethers is reported using 2&#8208;((difluoromethyl)thio)&#8208;3&#8208;methylbenzo[d]thiazol&#8208;3&#8208;ium triflate (BT&#8722;SCF2H) as a source of &#8722;SCF2H anions. The presence of silver(I) triflate as a catalyst was found to be crucial for stabilizing the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated anion, while the concomitant formation of a reactive 2&#8208;(alkoxy)benzothiazolium electrophile likely ensures a fast onward substitution reaction, avoiding the build&#8208;up of &#8722;SCF2H. To the best of our knowledge, this process represents the first report of a direct nucleophilic substitution reaction with &#8722;SCF2H and delivers products containing the medicinally relevant difluoromethylthio motif in a single step from widely available alcohols.

&lt;p&gt;Deoxygenative conversion of alcohols into difluoromethylthioethers is reported using 2-((difluoromethyl)thio)-3-methylbenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiazol-3-ium triflate (BT&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) as a source of &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H anions.

         <title>Flow Conditions&#8208;Controlled Divergent Oxidative Cyclization of Reticuline&#8208;type Alkaloids to Aporphine and Morphinandienone Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a divergent continuous&#8208;flow approach for the biomimetic oxidative cyclization of reticuline&#8208;type alkaloids to aporphine and morphinandienone natural products using hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. The methodologies developed in this work were based on the detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms in order to develop robust and original experimental conditions toward the selective synthesis of either aporphine or morphinandienone natural products. In this frame, we exploited the ability of HFIP to stabilize radical cation intermediates and to activate hypervalent iodine(III) oxidants for the flow synthesis of aporphine natural products such as glaucine, rogersine and nantenine. On the other hand, we established that PhI(OAc)(OTf), prepared by action of TMSOTf on PhI(OAc)2, was a powerful oxidant for the synthesis of morphinandienone natural products such as sebiferine and amurine. Also described in this contribution, the very first structure&#8208;reactivity relationship to assess the current limits of such oxidative flow processes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of seven C2&#8208;alkylcarbazoles via a sequence of Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling of arylamines with aryl halides followed by oxidative cyclization of the resulting diarylamines. Methyl groups at the positions 4 and 5 were introduced by taking advantage of the ortho&#8208;directed palladation of meta&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;sub&#173;stituted diarylamines and subsequent conversion of the pivaloyloxy to methyl groups via Stille coupling of intermediate triflates. The obtained ethyl&#8208; and dimethylcarbazoles served as analytical standards for their identification in petroleum samples and source rocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Deoxyfunctionalisation Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their abundance and readily available synthesis, alcohols provide ideal handles for the selective derivatisation of organic molecules. Radical chemistry offers versatile strategies for the conversion of C  sp  3  &#8211;O bonds into a wide range of C  sp  3  &#8211;C, C  sp  3  &#8211;H, or &#160;C  sp  3  &#8211;heteroatom bonds. In these reactions, alcohols are readily derivatised with an activator group which can undergo facile mesolysis to generate a primary, secondary, or tertiary open&#8208;shell species that can engage in further transformations. These strategies are particularly effective at overcoming steric limitations associated with nucleophilic substitution pathways. Despite their potential, the use of radical deoxyfunctionalisation reactions as a general strategy for the synthesis of useful and complex molecules remains underutilised. Herein, we highlight recent advancements in this exciting field using photocatalysis, transition metal catalysis or electrochemistry to initiate the radical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dithiocyanation of Alkynes with N&#8208;Thiocyanato&#8208;dibenzenesulfonimide and Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic thiocyanates widely exist in natural products, and act as important precursors of organic synthesis. An efficient dithiocyanation of alkynes with  N  &#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;dibenzenesulfonimide (NTSI) as the SCN  +  cation and ammonium thiocyanate as the SCN  &#8208;  anion sources has been developed. Highly active electrophilic reagent NTSI could react with various types of alkynes to build C(sp  2  )&#8208;SCN bond giving a variety of dithiocyanato olefin compounds under simple and mild conditions. Trace amount of water is beneficial to the dissociation of ammonium thiocyanate, which makes the SCN  &#8208;  anion easier to participate in the reaction. The protocol owns good to excellent yields up to 97%, a broad substrates scope including terminal and internal, alkyl and aryl alkynes, excellent functional group tolerance and good regioselectivity.</dc:description>

Dearomative [3+2] annulation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;isoxazoles with quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and quinone monoacetals (QMAs) provided various indoline&#8208; or 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused isoxazolines in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Isoxazolines are highly significant for the development of new synthetic methodology and pharmaceutics. Indolines and 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans are also privileged structures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. In continuation of our ongoing research on transformations of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles and quinone derivaties, herein we report Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [3+2] annulations of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles with quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and quinone monoacetals (QMAs). A variety of indoline&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused isoxazolines were afforded in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (all cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This method featured mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Bilateral Aromatic Extension of Corannulene Nucleus</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 18, May 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores bilateral aromatic extension of the corannulene nucleus through a combination of Heck and Mallory reactions.







Abstract
Herein we show that a dibromo imide derivative of corannulene could be subjected to a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction in order to install aryl vinylene groups in a bilateral fashion on the C5&#8208;symmetric aromatic nucleus. A photochemically&#8208;induced oxidative cyclization then affords &#960;&#8208;extended structures in isolated overall yields of 35&#8211;44&#8201;%. Due to the aromatic area extension and the presence of electron withdrawing groups, the synthesized molecules exhibit an anodic shift of &#8776;1&#8197;V in their first reduction potential as compared to pristine corannulene. The bilateral growth of the aromatic scaffold, therefore, represents a viable strategy to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with an electron deficient character.

         <title>Synthesis of Indolyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes from &#946;&#8208;Sulphonyl Aldehydes through One&#8208;Pot Sequential Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Syntheses of dienyl pyrroles and indoles were achieved by using &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl aldehydes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot sequential Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis. This transformation enables the access to various aliphatic as well as aromatic substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes. Further, trienyl indole was also synthesized employing this strategy.







Abstract
Introduction of a 1,3&#8208;diene moiety at the C3&#8208;position of pyrrole and indole bearing various aliphatic as well as aromatic functional groups with good stereoselectivity remains a challenging task. Keeping the synthetic applicability in mind, an eccentric strategy is developed to synthesize 1,3&#8208;dienyl pyrroles and indoles from unprotected pyrroles and indoles employing &#946;&#8208;sulphonyl aldehyde as a dienylating agent. This method is developed by using a one&#8208;pot sequential Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis strategy. The nucleophilicity of indole is transmitted through the conjugation to eliminate the sulfonyl groups in a step&#8208;wise manner. Further, this developed protocol was extended to the incorporation of a 1,3,5&#8208;triene moiety at the C3&#8208;position of indoles through unprecedented successive three sulfonyl group elimination. As an application of this strategy, a Diels&#8722;Alder reaction and hydrothiolation of 1,3&#8208;diene were demonstrated.

         <title>Dearomatization of Nitro(hetero)arenes through Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 18, May 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of the recent literatures on dearomative annulation reactions involving nitro(hetero)arenes for the construction of synthetically important polycyclic systems has been described.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions employing simple aromatic compounds have showcased remarkable progress in the recent decade and have emerged as one of the most straightforward and powerful tools for the creation of highly functionalized, three&#8208;dimensional molecular frameworks commonly encountered in medicinal chemistry and life sciences. Among the aromatic compounds in use, nitro(hetero)arenes, which feature a less pronounced aromatic character due to the presence of highly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro group, have been extensively used in different types of dearomatization reactions. The dearomative annulation reaction serves as a powerful and versatile method for the construction of complex polycyclic systems. This overview presents a brief summary of recent impressive advances in nitro(hetero)arenes dearomative annulation and provides some inspirations for future research.

A late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization using DDQ and subsequent chemoselective oxidative demethylation enables the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone.







Abstract
A unified approach for the first enantioselective total synthesis of magnoshinin and merrilliaquinone is reported. The key feature of the synthesis is the DDQ assisted chemoselective late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization of the polyoxygenated chiral tetralin core accessed by utilizing the relayed asymmetric induction strategy. Then, the follow&#8208;up of chemoselective redox chemistry facilitates the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin (28.2&#8201;% overall yield) and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone (20.6&#8201;% overall yield) along the shortest route, starting from the known 3&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

     alt="Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)-Magnoshinin and (+)-Merrilliaquinone: Application of a Late-Stage Oxidative Functionalization Protocol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A late-stage oxidative functionalization using DDQ and subsequent chemoselective oxidative demethylation enables the synthesis of (&#8722;)-magnoshinin and (+)-merrilliaquinone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unified approach for the first enantioselective total synthesis of magnoshinin and merrilliaquinone is reported. The key feature of the synthesis is the DDQ assisted chemoselective late-stage oxidative functionalization of the polyoxygenated chiral tetralin core accessed by utilizing the relayed asymmetric induction strategy. Then, the follow-up of chemoselective redox chemistry facilitates the synthesis of (&#8722;)-magnoshinin (28.2&#8201;% overall yield) and (+)-merrilliaquinone (20.6&#8201;% overall yield) along the shortest route, starting from the known 3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Stereodefined Skipped Trienes: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Terminal Alkynes with Allylic Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 18, May 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal alkynes with allylic halides for the efficient construction of stereodefined skipped trienes under mild reaction conditions in a single&#8208;step has been reported. A variety of functional groups were well tolerated within the catalytic system, providing a variety of substituted stereodefined skipped trienes in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanism investigations indicated that the Sonogashira reaction as the intermediate step and the radical pathway might not be involved in this novel multicomponent coupling reaction.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal alkynes with allylic halides to afford stereodefined skipped trienes was developed. The methodology leads to efficient construction of a series of stereodefined skipped trienes under mild reaction conditions in a single&#8208;step without organometallic alkyne. Preliminary mechanism investigations indicated that the Sonogashira reaction and the radical pathway might not be involved in this novel multicomponent coupling reaction.

Herein, we report a concise approach of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes in a two&#8208;step sequence starting from ortho&#8208;bromo benzylic alcohols and arylboronic acids, using intermolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and intramolecular N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated key C&#8722;O bonds construction.







Abstract
Benzo[c]chromones are valuable tricyclic systems of natural and biological significance. Herein, we report a concise approach of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes in a two&#8208;step sequence starting from ortho&#8208;bromo benzylic alcohols and arylboronic acids, using intermolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and intramolecular N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated key C&#8722;O bonds construction. Besides, the current method explored broad substrate scope under robust conditions. Notably, the practicality of the present approach is further extended for the total synthesis of Didehydroconicol.

Abstract
Regioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction between 4&#8208;hydroxydithiocoumarins with various epoxides and N&#8208;tosylaziridines is achieved for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;tosylaminosulfides. The present protocols showed high regioselectivity, broad substrates scope compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. In addition, some of the ring&#8208;opening products are utilized for the conversion of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiin and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine derivatives in presence of 10&#8197;mol% CuI in DMF at 120&#176;C. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity study of the newly synthesized compounds, namely &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides (3&#8201;d, 3&#8201;i &amp; 3&#8201;m) and &#946;&#8208;aminosulfides (5&#8201;a &amp; 5&#8201;e), have been investigated. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis&#8208;based measurements of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon treatment of MCF&#8208;7 and HeLa cells with 3&#8201;d, 3&#8201;i, and 3&#8201;m are commensurate with their anti&#8208;cancer properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regioselective ring-opening reaction between 4-hydroxydithiocoumarins with various epoxides and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosylaziridines is achieved for the synthesis of &#946;-hydroxysulfides and &#946;-N-tosylaminosulfides. The present protocols showed high regioselectivity, broad substrates scope compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. In addition, some of the ring-opening products are utilized for the conversion of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-oxathiin and 2,3-dihydro-1,4-thiazine derivatives in presence of 10&#8197;mol% CuI in DMF at 120&#176;C. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity study of the newly synthesized compounds, namely &#946;-hydroxysulfides (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;i&lt;/b&gt; &amp; &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;m&lt;/b&gt;) and &#946;-aminosulfides (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; &amp; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;e&lt;/b&gt;), have been investigated. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis-based measurements of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon treatment of MCF-7 and HeLa cells with &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;i&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;m&lt;/b&gt; are commensurate with their anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles from Terminal Vinyl Sulfones in Ionic Liquid: A Metal&#8208;Free Eliminative Azide&#8208;Olefinic Cycloaddition Route to Triazolyl Carbohydrates and Triazole&#8208;linked Bissaccharides</title>

         <dc:description>
An Eliminative Azide&#8208;Olefinic Cycloaddition strategy has been utilized for the metal&#8208;free regioselective synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from terminal vinyl sufones in ionic liquid water mixture at 100oC. Both non&#8208;carbohydrate and carbohydrate&#8208;based terminal vinyl sulfones afforded different 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as well as several triazoles&#8208;linked bissaccharides.







Abstract
Several terminal vinyl sulfones, derived from styrene epoxide and monomesylated glycerol were reacted with benzylazide in a metal&#8208;free condition to afford regioselectively 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles (1,4&#8208;DTs) via Eliminative Azide&#8208;Olefinic Cycloaddition (EAOC) reactions. The stereoelectronic repulsions between the aryl/alkyl groups attached to the azido and vinyl sulfone functionalities play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the reactions. The N, N&#8208;dimethyl ethanolammonium formate&#8208;water mixture consisting of a biodegradable ionic liquid turned out to be the best solvent system to reduce significantly the reaction time and increase the yield of products in almost all cases. Furthermore, a pair of exocyclic terminal vinyl sulfone&#8208;modified carbohydrates were prepared from protected&#8208;glucofuranoside and &#8208;allofuranoside. These carbohydrates were reacted under the EAOC conditions with a host of organic azides to afford the corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole modified carbohydrates. Azido sugars were also reacted with terminal vinyl sulfone modified carbohydrates under similar conditions to afford 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linked bissacharides. This powerful strategy serves as a potential yet practical route for delivering two carbon unit (required for the C4&#8208;C5 of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole ring) directly connected to sugar body in place of a sugar alkyne.

         <title>Evaluation of 6&#8208;Halogenated 2&#8208;Pyridone Moieties as Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 18, May 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can 6&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones form halogen bonds? And if so, does their tautomeric form play a role? What DFT calculations predicted could indeed be confirmed via X&#8208;ray crystallography with four simple pyridones. Halide affinity studies, however, cannot establish XB as the predominant interaction in solution.







Abstract
6&#8208;Halo&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones and their pyridol tautomers show different grades of polarization on their halogen substituents in DFT calculations. This and the fact that the tautomeric equilibrium is affected by the surrounding medium make them interesting candidates for a new platform of halogen bond donors. We therefore probed four simple halopyridones for their halogen bonding properties both in the solid state and in solution. Concurring with hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding indeed is found to be an interaction governing the packing motif in pyridone crystals, which is more pronounced in N&#8208;methylated congeners. Solution studies using a halide abstraction reaction, and NMR titrations against bromide salts, however, showed no clear evidence for halogen bonding in solution.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis with other kinds of catalysis is a powerful strategy to address the barriers met in reactions driven by single catalyst. Under environmentally benign condition, photoredox catalysis produces radical species via visible light irradiation. These species then work with other catalysts, often resulting in unconventional reactivities, by which the scope of reaction could be expanded. Interest in photocatalysis in the synthetic chemistry community has grown tremendously over the past five years, and one of the most striking emerging features is the development of dual catalytic approaches. This minireview summarizes the progress on this theme, mainly including dual catalytic systems merging photoredox activation with acid/base catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Photoswitching for Rate Enhancement of an Organocatalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we report that applying  in situ  LED&#8208;NMR irradiation with appropriate wavelength resulted in the photoswitching of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazone C=N double bond configuration. This reaction was previously reported to be the first step in a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction, where the minor but stable  Z  &#8208;isomer is the reactive intermediate. By enhancing the rate of the isomerization, we could show that the overall rate of the cyclization could be increased and followed directly by NMR kinetics. Exclusively light with a specific wavelength matching the isomerization process affected the cyclization. The light&#8208; and acid&#8208;mediated isomerization provide complementary pathways that can be exploited in synthetic applications to increase reaction rates of asymmetric transformations, especially in reactions requiring high loadings of elaborate chiral catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirocyclopentane Oxindoles Bearing Five Consecutive Stereocenters via Secondary Amine&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work delineates a Michael&#8208;initiated ring&#8208;closing [3+2] cycloaddition of newly designed 3&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. During the chiral secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, highly functionalized spirocyclopentane oxindole derivatives containing five consecutive stereogenic centers were formed, two of which were chiral quaternary. All the desired products are smoothly obtained in good yields (up to 90%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99:1 er) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;95:5 dr). Meanwhile, the practicality of this strategy was highlighted by the further gram&#8208;scale experiment and a set of synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A selective and high&#8208;rate Ru&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of alkenes with vinylimidazole is disclosed. Cross&#8208;metathesis is known to operate less efficiently on&#160;N&#8208;heterocycles, but through optimization by means of statistical experimental design and multiple regression, optimal reaction conditions were identified that allowed for consistent high&#8208;yields without the need of overly complicated set&#8208;ups or additives.&#160; The method was tested on a series of terminal alkene reagents with a variety of different functional groups and it provides the corresponding target molecules in good to high yields.&#160;

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

We hope that this review will be useful for synthetic organic chemists and further stimulate the advancement of more novel strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Functionalization of 8&#8208;Substituted Quinolines with para&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to Unsymmetrical Tri(hetero)arylmethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient method for the preparation of unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes from para&#8208;quinone methides and derivatives of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline under copper catalysis is described.







Abstract
A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substrates.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <title>Dibenzothiazepine based MCR Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Privileged scaffolds which can unveil unknown territories of the chemical space are constantly prominent. As such, 1,5&#8208;dibenzothiazepines not only offer structural diversification but also a very unique binding mode due to their &#8220;butterfly&#8221; conformation. We provide MCR&#8208;based annulations of this scaffold towards three different tetracycles in a straightforward, two&#8208;step procedure. We synthesize a library of 30 tetracyclic 1,5&#8208;tetrazolo&#8208;, fused imidazo&#8208; and lactam&#8208;1,5&#8208;dibenzothiazepines with scalable and one&#8208;pot procedures. In addition, we obtained single crystal structures of certain derivatives, demonstrating the conformational behavior of the scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Synthesis of Tetra&#8208;Boronate Esters Analogues and the Corresponding Boronic Acids Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications. In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Biology of &#945;GalCer: A Chemist's Toolbox for the Stimulation of Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to the chemist's toolbox for the stimulation of invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells. This Review encompasses the synthetic strategies for the preparation of the iNKT cell agonist &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer), its TH1/TH2 skewing analogs, and other synthetic probes for the elucidation of mechanisms of &#945;GalCer trafficking.







Abstract
Often referred to as the &#8220;Swiss Army knife&#8221; of the immune system, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes stimulated by the synthetic glycolipid &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) when in complex with the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells. Through their ability to produce TH1 and TH2 cytokines and co&#8208;stimulate several other lymphocytes, iNKT cells have emerged as central players in directing the immune response in a range of physiological processes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Over the years, synthetic chemistry has advanced the field of iNKT cell stimulation with the development of more efficient approaches to prepare &#945;GalCer, and, additionally, with the chemical synthesis of &#945;GalCer analogs in the search of better TH1/TH2 cytokine skewing compounds for therapeutic applications. Here, we review the strategies for the synthesis of &#945;GalCer and its analogs, including synthetic probes, together with the most important advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds, as a guide to the available tools for interrogating the iNKT cell&#8722;&#945;GalCer&#8722;CD1d complex and inspiration for future research.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8211;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>A Toolbox of Fluorescent Peptide Biosensors to Highlight Protein Kinases in Complex Samples : focus on cyclin&#8208;dependent kinases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of sensitive and selective strategies for detection of disease biomarkers constitutes a major challenge for diagnostics and companion assays. New strategies are required to advance personalized and point&#8208;of&#8208;care medicine. Protein kinases (PK) are hyperactivated in many human cancers thereby constituting relevant biomarkers and attractive pharmacological targets.Yet quantification of PK expression levels alone does not convey an accurate readout of their activity, since PKs are subject to numerous interactions and post&#8208;translational regulations. Hence technologies that report on PK function are essential for complete appreciation of their behaviour and dysregulation in physio&#8208;pathological settings. This review focuses on fluorescent peptide biosensors designed to report on PK activities, and in particular on a toolbox of biosensors tailored to monitor cyclin&#8208;dependent kinases. These selective optical probes offer a straightforward means of quantifying differences in kinase activities between healthy and cancer cells, and can report on alterations in response to therapeutics in vitro, in living cells and in vivo.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative azide&#8208;olefin cycloaddition (OAOC) reaction of differently substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls with azides provided an efficient method for preparing biologically active 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In this study, the cycloaddition reaction was found to be a simple and powerful method for constructing diverse mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;(1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole) functionalized heterocyclic compounds in moderate to high yields with great regioselectivity. The XRD&#8208;analysis data of one of the bis&#8208;triazole derivatives supported the regioselectivity as well as the conformity of the method in the construction of the triazole nucleus. The preliminary antifungal profile against C. albicans was observed with cinnamaldehyde based triazole derivatives demonstrating promising results.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. Here we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus  trans  &#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The influence on glycosyl selectivity of substituting oxygen for sulfur at the 3&#8208;position of 4,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylidene&#8208;protected mannopyranosyl thioglycosides is reported and varies considerably according to the protecting group employed at the 3&#8208;position. The substitution of a thioether at the 3&#8208;position for the more usual 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzyl ether results in a significant loss of activity. The installation of a 3&#8208;  S  &#8208;picolinyl thioether at the 3&#8208;position results in a complex reaction mixture, from which a stable seven&#8208;membered bridged bicyclic pyridinium ion is isolated, while the corresponding 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picolinyl ether affords a highly &#945;&#8208;selective coupling reaction. A 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picolyl ester provides excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity, while the analogous 3&#8208;  S  &#8208;picolyl thioester gives a highly &#945;&#8208;selective reaction. The best &#946;&#8208;selectivity is seen with a 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyldisulfanyl) system.

         <title>Synthesis and recognizing Copper (II) properties of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole&#8208;indolizine&#160;bis&#8208;heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel&#160;  bis  &#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3  H  &#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  b  ]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and&#160;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties&#160;was designed, synthesized and evaluated as a&#160;Copper (II) recognizing agent.&#160;This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds,&#160;a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in&#160;a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions&#160;was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the&#160;  N  &#8208;acylated&#160;tetrazole. Consequently,&#160;  N  &#8208;acylated tetrazole&#160;was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process (Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling,&#160;1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, oxidative aromatization) to afford the target compounds&#160;  16a&#8208;j  &#160;in 16 to 53% yield.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel&#160;  bis  -heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2-dihydro-3  H  -pyrrolo[3,4-  b  ]indolizin-3-one and&#160;1,5-disubstituted tetrazole moieties&#160;was designed, synthesized and evaluated as a&#160;Copper (II) recognizing agent.&#160;This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds,&#160;a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in&#160;a double one-pot process involving four-step reactions&#160;was developed. The first process is a one-pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the&#160;  N  -acylated&#160;tetrazole. Consequently,&#160;  N  -acylated tetrazole&#160;was subjected to a one-pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process (Sonogashira cross-coupling,&#160;1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, oxidative aromatization) to afford the target compounds&#160;  16a-j  &#160;in 16 to 53% yield. The photophysical properties of the obtained&#160;  bis  -heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition, finding changes in the emission and fluorescence spectra profile upon addition of the corresponding salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Perfluoroalkylmethyl&#8208;Substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines Derivatives through 1&#8208;Iodo&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(acetoxy) Synthons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, efficient, diastereoselective two&#8208;step synthetic route to substituted tetrahydroquinolines bearing a perfluoroalkylmethyl group, was achieved via a perfluoroalkylated, iodo&#8208;bis&#8208;acetoxy (masked aldol) intermediate resulting from selective radical bis&#8208;addition of vinyl acetate on RF&#8722;I.







Abstract
Novel 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylmethyl,4&#8208;arylamino substituted tetrahydroquinolines (THQ) were expeditiously synthesized from perfluoroalkyl iodides RF&#8722;I and monosubstituted anilines. First, radical bis&#8208;addition of vinyl acetate on RF&#8722;I afforded gem&#8208;iodoacetoxy derivatives (newly characterized by NMR and MS) being actually masked/activated aldol synthons. Their reaction in 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio with arylamines afforded title THQ under mild conditions in good yields (60&#8211;95&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (65&#8201;:&#8201;35&#8211;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 cis/trans isomer ratio); m&#8208;substituted anilines regiospecifically lead to 7&#8208;substituted THQ. Mechanistic investigation suggested the THQ formation to proceed through Michael then imine addition of two aniline units on an RF&#8208;substituted crotonaldehyde intermediate, then through the cyclization of the resulting bis(arylamino/imino) intermediate through electrophilic aromatic substitution. Various RF (C6, C2, C4) and arylamine substitutions (p&#8208;,o&#8208;,m&#8208; alkyl, alkoxyl, halogen&#8230;) were thus exemplified.

         <title>Z&#8209;selective alkene formation from reductive aldehyde homo&#8208;couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E &#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z &#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate Mes F P(H)P(O)(OEt) 2 , 6 , with an electron&#8208;deficient Mes F = 2,4,6&#8208;(CF 3 ) 3 Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z &#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient Mes F , which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of Mes F , the E &#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P &#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of Z&#8208;isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA&#8208;conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys  5  , Phe  7  , Tyr  9  , Gly  12  , Leu  14  , and Thr  17  were crucial for binding BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose, BSA&#8208;D&#8208;galactose and BSA&#8208;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser  3  , Pro  4  , and Val  13  resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg  8  plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose/D&#8208;galactose from BSA&#8208;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. The thermodynamics of binding of the selected alanine analogues was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Low to moderate binding affinities were determined for the tetravalent MUC1 glycopeptide and asialofetuin, respectively, and high for the fucose rich polysaccharide, fucoidan. The thermodynamic profile of interactions with asialofetuin exhibits shift to an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism compared to the fucoidan, which displayed an enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation, typically associated with the carbohydrate&#8208;lectin recognition process.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

         <title>Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation and Etherification Reactions of Benzylic Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistriflimide&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of benzylacetates with both trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes lead to propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The acid assists the release of the reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the media, which is the ultimate catalytic species. The cationic nature of the processes is documented.







Abstract
Addition of catalytic amounts of bistriflimide triggers useful coupling reactions of benzyl acetates with trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes to afford propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The added acid assists the release of reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the reaction media, which were found to act as the ultimate catalytic species responsible for the C&#8722;C and the C&#8722;O forming steps. The cationic nature of these coupling processes is documented.

         <dc:description>A practical electrochemical method for the generation of CF3Se  &#8722;  anion from a shelf&#8208;stable reagent (TsSeCF3) is reported allowing the metal&#8208;free trifluoromethylselenolation of activated alkyl halides. Trifluoromethylselenolated compounds have been obtained in modest to excellent yields under the optimized reaction conditions. Finally, cyclic voltammetric and  19F NMR studies are presented and allowed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic studies on the epoxidation of alkenes by macrocyclic manganese porphyrin catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. In order to achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8208;88%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazone&#8208;based systems have been, and continue to be, widely studied in the field of supramolecular chemistry due to the chemical versatility of their triatomic  C=N&#8208;N  structure, whose amino nitrogen commonly bears a methyl group or a hydrogen atom. Herein we review the conformational, configurational, and constitutional dynamics of these systems, focusing on the particularly important role of the N&#8208;H moiety of the hydrazone framework in each of those processes observed in molecular and supramolecular systems published in recent decades. Due to the enormous diversity of supramolecular architectures and molecular entities, the most representative synthetic methodologies to obtain them are described.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylated analogues of indolylthio glycosides as glycosyl donors with enhanced activation profile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While studying indolylthio glycosides, previously we determined their activation profile that required large excess of activators. This drawback was partially addressed in the present study of  N  &#8208;alkylated SInR derivatives. The activation process was studied by NMR and the increased understanding of the mechanism led to a discovery of different activation pathways taking place with SIn versus SInR derivatives. Also investigated was orthogonality of the SInR leaving groups versus thioglycosides and selective activation of thioimidates over SInR glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction Between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The  N&#8208;  tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

         <title>Organic Synthesis with Elemental Lanthanides &#8211; Going Beyond Samarium and Ytterbium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide (Ln) metals are strong reducing agents (E  0  (Ln  3+  /Ln  0  ) &#8776; &#8208;2.3 V vs. NHE) which can be applied in various manners in organic synthesis. While samarium and ytterbium have been employed for more than 50 years, the last twenty years have seen the emergence of synthetic applications using other metals such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium or dysprosium. The large electron reservoir of lanthanide metals, the Lewis acidic character of the Ln  3+  ions and their intermediate electronegativity compared to lithium or magnesium can provide unique reactivity patterns. This review provides an overview on the potential of these metals for synthetic organic chemistry in the following areas: i) for Grignard type reactivity and radical generation, ii) in reduction chemistry involving carbonyl compounds and dehalogenation reactions and iii) in combination with transition&#8208;metals.</dc:description>

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Molecular Targets of Neurotoxic Insecticides in Apis mellifera</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cloning of the honeybee genes encoding ion channels targeted by neurotoxic insecticides and their functional reconstitution in heterologous expression system allow the assessment of the different insecticide classes including pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. Elucidation of their mode of action, by combining electrophysiology and molecular docking, might help for the development of insecticides less harmful for beneficial insects.







Abstract
The intensive use of insecticides, combined with other factors such as habitat loss, might explain worldwide decrease of insect populations documented in the past twenty years. However, due to the involvement of pest species in crop destruction and in vector&#8208;borne diseases, insecticides will probably continue to be required still for decades. The most commercially successful insecticides are neurotoxicants acting on ion channels of the central nervous system affecting thereby cellular excitability and synaptic transmission and causing insect paralysis and fatality. In this article, we provide an overview of the insecticides acting on voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels, GABA&#8208;gated chloride channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We summarize the current knowledge on those ion channels from the honeybee Apis mellifera and discuss the possible mode of action of neurotoxic insecticides.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments.&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroxylation of Stilbenes by White&#8208;Rot Fungal P450s Enables Preparative&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Stilbenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scaling up biocatalytic reactions involving cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) is challenging due to their instability, low substrate loading, co&#8208;factor and oxygen requirements as well as the dependency on a reductase partner, which limits their integration into synthetic chemistry. Recently, a biocatalytic study investigated frequently used bacterial cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) for the production of bioactive stilbenoids, extending the repertoire of sustainable synthetic strategies with remarkable success. This article explores the complementary application of less common eukaryotic P450s as a viable alternative for generating the same compounds when employed as a&#160; Pichia pastoris &#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. In a direct comparison to their bacterial equivalents, the recently discovered P450s CYP5035S7 and CYP5035S9 from the white&#8208;rot fungus&#160; Polyporus arcularius&#160; are shown to be competitively efficient at synthesising stilbenoids at preparative&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mincle, a C&#8208;type lectin receptor (CLR), senses certain lipid conjugates, leading to the activation of the innate immune system. The lipid conjugate ligands include glyco&#8208;, glycero&#8208;, and mannitol lipids. Recently, a fungal &#946;&#8208;mannosyloxymannitol glycolipid demonstrating a novel architecture, &#8220;44&#8208;2,&#8221; was isolated from the fungus&#160;  Malassezia  and displayed potent Mincle&#8208;mediated signaling activity. For this study, we synthesized the diastereomeric pair of mannosyloxymannitol glycolipids and their analogues, and analyzed the structure&#8211;activity relationships of Mincle&#8208;mediated signaling. The results suggest that the dimannosyl&#8208;fatty acid moiety in the mannosyloxymannitol glycolipid&#8208;type structure plays a major role in the molecular recognition of Mincle.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diazoquinones and Azidophenols via Diazo&#8208;transfer Reaction of Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first efficient diazo&#8208;transfer reaction of phenols is described.  o  &#8208;Quinone diazides (diazoquinones) were prepared from phenols in high yields by the diazo&#8208;transfer reaction using 2&#8208;azido&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (IPrAP,  2&#8208;PF  6  ), which is a safe and stable crystalline. The reaction efficiently proceeded in methanol in the presence of a base. Phenols substituted with electron&#8208;donating groups reacted more smoothly than those having electron withdrawing groups. Reactive phenols were diazotized by IPrAP with  i  Pr  2  NH as a base and low reactive phenols were diazotized with  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine (DMAP). Furthermore, thus formed diazoquinones reacted with sodium azide in 2&#8208;methoxyethanol to give corresponding azidophenol in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugation of Carbohydrates with Quinolines: A Powerful Synthetic Tool</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of carbohydrates with quinolines is an useful strategy to improve the bioactivity profile of the quinoline scaffold. This Review discusses the synthetic efforts to access these valuable molecules and the isolation of glycoquinolines from natural sources in the period 2000&#8211;2021. In addition, the bioactivity profiles and potential therapeutic uses of these compounds are presented.







Abstract
A detailed revision on natural and synthetic glycosylated quinolines, spanning the last 20&#8197;years, is presented. Exhaustive descriptions about the state of the art of the synthesis and relevant applications of these glyco&#8208;heterocycles are provided. In addition, an account of the natural products containing this motif and their associated bioactivity data are also outlined. For the sake of consistency, quinolones are also covered as well as hybrid compounds, embodied with linkers between the heterocyclic ring and the carbohydrate fragment.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

         <title>The Structure of Hemicalide from the Marine Sponge Hemimycale sp</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemicalide, isolated from the marine sponge Hemimycale sp., is a very potent cytotoxic compound from a marine sponge with an original mode of action. Its planar structure has been established by NMR and a proposal for 17 of its 21 stereogenic centers is made on the basis of syntheses of analogues.







Abstract
Hemicalide is a marine natural product isolated from the sponge Hemimycale sp., collected near the Torres Islands of Vanuatu. It is characterized by cytotoxicity in the sub&#8208;nanomolar range, with an original mode of action. This article describes the establishment of the planar structure of hemicalide, based on extensive use of 2D&#8208;NMR experiments. The molecule belongs to the polyketide class with an irregular combination of acetates and propionates and adorned with two unusual hydroxylated six&#8208;membered ring lactones. After publication of the original patent, groups in Paris and Cambridge (UK) launched synthetic programmes with the aim of elucidating the configurations of some of the 21 stereogenic centers. The second part of the article discusses these achievements and presents the best hypothesis, to date, for hemicalide.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8211;activity studies produced a new near infrared cyanine heptamethine molecular probe that is rapidly activated by nitroreductase enzyme to give &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence that can penetrate thick biological tissue.







Abstract
Two new classes of near&#8208;infrared molecular probes were prepared and shown to exhibit &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence when cleaved by the nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of cell hypoxia. The fluorescent probes are heptamethine cyanine dyes with a central 4&#8216;&#8208;carboxylic ester group on the heptamethine chain that is converted by a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism to a 4&#8216;&#8208;caboxylate group that greatly enhances the fluorescence brightness. Each compound was prepared by ring opening of a Zincke salt. The chemical structures have either terminal benzoindolinenes or propargyloxy auxochromes, which provide favorable red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission wavelengths and a hyperchromic effect that enhances the photon output when excited by 808&#8197;nm light. A fluorescent probe with terminal propargyloxy&#8208;indolenines exhibited less self&#8208;aggregation and was rapidly activated by nitroreductase with large &#8220;turn on&#8220; fluorescence; thus, it is the preferred choice for translation towards in&#8197;vivo applications.

         <title>A Photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama Reaction Catalytic in Chromium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H functionalization opens a convenient pathway to N&#8208;substituted benzo[4,5]thiazolo[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,4]triazol&#8208;1&#8208;ium salts. Using this procedure, tricyclic thiazolium salts containing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating aromatic substituents as well as aliphatic substituents can be synthesized.







Abstract
Herein we report a generally applicable method for the preparation of N&#8208;substituted benzo[4,5]thiazolo[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,4]triazol&#8208;1&#8208;ium salts from air stable precursors. This transformation features selective deprotection of a para&#8208;methoxybenzyl protected thiol followed by C&#8722;H functionalization of the linked 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts under oxidative conditions. Using this procedure, we synthesized a variety of tricyclic thiazolium salts which contain both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating aromatic substituents as well as aliphatic substituents. Our approach also tolerates many functional groups including alkynes, alcohols, diols, amides, and polyethers.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for the hydroxylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes was developed. The transformation relies on the anodic oxidation of arene and the use trifluoroacetic acid as an oxygen source. The reaction is carried out in an electrochemical flow reactor, which allowed to synthesize sensitive products by shortening reaction/residence time to 1.25&#8197;minutes and to perform a scale up experiment.







Abstract
Electrochemical hydroxylation of arenes by trifluoroacetic acid provides a straightforward access to aryl oxygen compounds under the mild and environmental benign reaction conditions. Harmful and pollutant stoichiometric amounts of oxidation reagents and the use of metal&#8208;catalysts can be avoided. Herein, we present a novel method for the synthesis of hydroxylated products from electron&#8208;rich arenes that was achieved by the implementation of a continuous&#8208;flow setup. The continuous nature of the process allowed to fine&#8208;tune the reactions conditions in order to prevent the decomposition of the sensitive products expanding the reaction scope beyond electron&#8208;poor and neutral arenes that were previously reported in the batch processes. Thus, synthetically valuable hydroxylated arenes were obtained in good yields with the residence time just over a minute. In order to demonstrate the reliability and the efficiency of the electrochemical flow setup, a scale up experiment was also performed.

         <title>MALDI&#8208;MS/MS of N&#8208;Terminal TMPP&#8208;Acyl Peptides: A Worthwhile Tool to Decipher Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acylation with tris(trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium (TMPP), a chemical reagent specifically targeting peptide N&#8208;termini, was found to provide very valuable sequencing information provided that the derivatized charged peptide was engaged in MALDI MS/MS analyses combining LID and CID activations. In addition to readable N&#8208;terminal sequence ion series, fragmentation of aliphatic residues side&#8208;chain distinguished isomeric leucine and isoleucine. Unexpected cysteine acylation was also evidenced.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal derivatization of proteins with permanently positive charged reagent constitutes a viable mass spectrometry bottom&#8208;up strategy for systematic confident identification of protein N&#8208;termini. Although shotgun nanoLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS approaches are commonly applied in that context by dissociating multiply charged molecular ions upon low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociations (CID), we were keen to investigate an alternative sequencing method reckoning on more comprehensive high energy charge remote fragmentations (CRF) available with a MALDI&#8208;Tof/Tof instrument. Hence, two tunable activation methods, i.&#8201;e. metastable laser&#8208;induced dissociations (LID) and high energy CID, were applied to several synthetic N&#8208;terminal tris(trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium (TMPP) acetyl peptides and their MS/MS behaviors were compared with low energy CID MS/MS data (LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;QqTof equipment). The amino acid composition was found to play a significant role in the peptide backbone dissociation pathways of these fixed singly charged ions. Proline, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, but also surprisingly aliphatic residues were impacting the expected sequence fragmentation pattern.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Remote Deuteration of N&#8208;Heteroarenes &#8211; Broad Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeling the remote sites of pyridines for drug discovery and mechanistic applications is a challenge that can be overcome by submitting heteroaromatic substrates to a base&#8208;mediated deuteration procedure using a combination of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide and deuterated DMSO. According to DFT investigations, the selectivity is controlled by the thermodynamic stability of the intermediary pyridyl anions.







Abstract
Deuterated organic molecules provide the basis for many applications in life sciences and material research. Thus, methodologies to access labeled compounds with defined selectivity continue to be important. Using KOtBu as base and DMSO&#8208;d6 as deuterium source, we present a general and applicable method for the selective deuteration of a set of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles (pyridines, azines and bioactive molecules). Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction proceeds via deprotonation of the substrates by the dimsyl anion. The relative thermodynamic stability of the heterocycle anions determines the distribution and degree of deuteration.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly, substrate compatibility was explored. 21 new disulfide and thioether macrocycles were synthesized that incorporated a wide breadth of structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.

         <title>New Mechanistic Insights into the Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the results of our quantum mechanical investigation of the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters catalyzed by [RuCl  2  (MeOH)  2  ((  R  )&#8208;MeOBIPHEP)] (  7a  ), which is generated  in situ  from [Ru(OAc)  2  ((  R  )&#8208;MeOBIPHEP)] (  4a  ) and HCl in methanol. Interestingly, HCl not only acts as an activator for  4a  as it has a dramatic effect on the reaction itself: While HCl /  4a  = 2 leads to rather poor results (36% ee and 13% conv. after 4 h at S / C = 50&#8217;000), HCl /  4a  = 20 results in high efficiency (&gt;99.9% conv.) and enantioselectivity (99% ee favoring the opposite enantiomer) under otherwise identical conditions. The origin for this sweeping change in performance has remained a mystery for two decades. Here, we show for the first time that a highly selective HCl pathway becomes operational under acidic conditions, which outcompetes moderately selective pathways dominating under neutral conditions. Furthermore, we explain the effects of common phosphorus substituents on the activity of the catalyst</dc:description>

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Acetalation/Selective Benzoylation Sequence for the Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Glycosyl Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed.







Abstract
Based on SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed. Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene Carbonates from Aromatic Aldehydes**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one&#8208;pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The combination of a N&#8208;phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity. The reaction scope was investigated with a range of aromatic aldehydes and the corresponding vinylene carbonates were obtained with 32&#8211;86&#8201;% isolated yields (14&#8197;examples).

         <title>Quadruple Functionalization of a Tetraphenylethylene Aromatic Scaffold with Ynamides or Tetracyanobutadienes: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraphenylethylene compound was effectively functionalized in three synthetic steps with four ynamide and four TCBD (1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene) groups. The latter displays near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Ynamides are useful and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis, from which 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes (TCBD) can be prepared for application in molecular electronics. However, their insertion onto multi&#8208;functional molecular scaffold remains a synthetic challenge. In this work, we report the two&#8208;steps synthesis in good isolated yield (64&#8201;% overall, 89&#8201;% stepwise) of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bearing four ynamides, and its further one&#8208;step conversion into the tetra&#8208;TCBD derivative through a [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization sequence. The concomitant formation of the four ynamides required a specific optimisation of the reaction conditions. Although a poor fluorescent emitter in solution, the tetra&#8208;TCBD compound displayed near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state, which is an attractive optoelectronic feature when considering future applications in molecular electronic devices.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;, pyrazolium&#8208;, and bis&#8208;benzimidazolium&#8208;containing ionic liquids were synthesized from easily available, unprotected carbohydrates such as d&#8208;ribose, d&#8208;xylose, d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;fructose and l&#8208;sorbose.







Abstract
Three series of new ionic liquids (ILs), namely imidazolium&#8208;, pyrazolium&#8208;, and bis&#8208;benzimidazolium&#8208;containing ILs, were prepared from low&#8208;cost, unprotected carbohydrates. Information on anion&#8208;cation interactions and solvation shell were obtained via diffusion NMR and heteronuclear Overhauser correlation maps (HOESY), respectively.

         <title>Divergent Annulation of Spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and Fused (Epoxyetheno)indeno&#8208;Furan from 1,2&#8208;Diketone and 1&#8208;Cyanoketone</title>

         <dc:description>
A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity.

     alt="Divergent Annulation of Spiro[indoline-pyran] and Fused (Epoxyetheno)indeno-Furan from 1,2-Diketone and 1-Cyanoketone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A operationally simple one-step method developed for the spiro[indoline-pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furan derivatives from 1-cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2-diketon.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline-pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furan compounds from 1-cyanoketones and 1,2-diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal-Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1-cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra-substituted carbon center and sequential hexa- and penta-cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline-pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis Enables the Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Olefins Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins with carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed, which is based on visible&#8208;light photoredox/boronic acid catalysis. The direct use of CAs as acyl&#8208;radical precursors was made possible with the aid of boronic acid, and CAs were easily converted into the corresponding cyclic ketones without the need for any stoichiometric activating reagents.







Abstract
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins using carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed. With the aid of a boronic acid, CAs can be used as acyl&#8208;radical precursors in catalytic photoredox reactions driven by visible light. The CAs are easily converted into their corresponding cyclic ketones without the need to use any stoichiometric activating reagents. Mechanistic studies implied that the formation of an &#8220;ate&#8221; complex from the CA and boronic acid is crucial for the generation of the acyl radical equivalent from the unreactive carboxy group.

         <title>Origins of Organic Chemistry and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of organic chemistry and organic synthesis started in the middle ages, long before molecular compositions were known. Paradigm shifts caused by Lavoisier, Chevreuil, W&#246;hler, Liebig, Kolbe and Berthelot are highlighted. The graphic shows some early key organic molecules, but although synthesis and analysis had become well established sciences by the 1840s, the chemical structures remained essentially unknown.







Abstract
The words organic and synthesis originate with Aristotle (meaning &#8216;instrumental&#8217; and &#8216;put together&#8217;, respectively) but had different meanings over time. The iatrochemists prepared numerous pharmaceutical remedies in the 1600s but had no concept of organic chemistry. Buffon, Bergman and Gren defined organic bodies as living things in the 1700s, but discrete organic compounds remained unknown. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, organic natural products were isolated by Scheele, and Chevreuil separated carboxylic acids from saponification of fats. Organic chemistry had started. Lavoisier invented and Berzelius improved combustion analysis for organic characterization. Descartes&#8217; dictum that synthesis is required to prove an analysis was enacted by Bergman and others. The concept of organic chemistry changed radically when W&#246;hler and Kolbe prepared organic compounds from the elements. Berthelot's syntheses of non&#8208;natural fats in 1853 started modern synthetic organic chemistry as the chemistry of carbon compounds, regardless of whether occurring in Nature or not.

Abstract
An efficient protocol for the synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones is described. First, propargyl&#8208;containing Ugi adducts were transformed to polysubstituted dihydroisoquinolines by an intramolecular Au&#8208;catalyzed alkyne hydro&#8208;arylation, followed by the alkene isomerization process. Then, these pivotal intermediates were engaged in a xanthate&#8208;based oxidative radical cascade addition/cyclization process with a suitable alkene.

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters and Amides through Hydrogen Borrowing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the iridium catalysed direct alkylation of amino esters and amides using alcohols, which can utilise both the free base and HCl salts of the amine, was developed. This reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen borrowing mechanism.







Abstract
The iridium catalysed N&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and amides using alcohols through hydrogen borrowing has been developed. The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.

         <title>Smart Photochromic Materials Triggered with Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, various classes of molecular photoswitches triggered with visible light are reported together with their applications in phototriggered smart materials &#8211; polymers, hydrogels, surfaces, porous materials, and sunlight energy storage materials. Advantages of such systems over classical UV&#8208;light triggered photochromic materials, the scope of their applicability, and their limitations are discussed.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches reversibly convert the energy of light into a variety of structural changes at the molecular level. They can be integrated into smart materials with broad range of applicability. While most photochromic systems require UV light for activation, application of photoswitches operational entirely within the visible or NIR range of light brings considerable benefits, such as biocompatibility, better light penetration through the material, propelling with sunlight, or a possibility to design dual systems that are mutually activated with UV or visible light frequencies for two distinct functions. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant classes of molecular photoswitches, and demonstrate a selection of photochromic polymers, gels, porous materials, surfaces, energy&#8208;storing materials and other systems triggered with visible light.

         <dc:description>
A conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall was facilely synthesized. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by different techniques. Its photophysical properties and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices were further studied.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Tyrosine&#8208;Click Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine&#8208;click reaction was established for the conjugation of oligonucleotides exhibiting a tyrosine moiety and using phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model. The reaction can be applied in solution or on solid support.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;Diacetyl tyrosine and 3&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;propanoic acid were converted into phosphoramidite derivatives and introduced to the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of oligonucleotides. The resulting oligonucleotides exhibiting a 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl alkyl group were conjugated with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model of a Y&#8208;click reaction. The reaction is fast (&lt;1&#8197;h) and efficient (&gt;90&#8201;%). A partial side reaction occurred at the C8 position of deoxyguanosine in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. This side reaction does not take place on the G quadruplex and double&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides and when N2 position of guanine is protected. This Y&#8208;click reaction could be applied to 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione derivatives displaying a fluorescent dye, a carbohydrate or orthogonal functions (alkyne, azide, ketone or maleimide) for the labelling of oligonucleotides.

         <title>Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Cryptands with Rarely Strong Affinities for Binding Neutral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8242;iterative approach&#8242; of delicately tunning the non&#8208;covalent interactions could be a powerful route to construct molecular hosts that exhibit high selectivity and affinity for guest molecules. Through tailoring spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (especially H&#8208;bonding), cryptands with rarely strong affinities for binding neutral guest molecules were achieved.







Abstract
Herein, we present the syntheses of two new crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based cryptands and their complexation behaviors with neutral organic molecules. The interactions between 4/5 and G1/G2 were fast exchange systems forming pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio. The association constant (Ka) of &#8220;long&#8208;armed&#8221; cryptand 5 with G2 was even up to 2.5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, which is 10 to 103&#8197;times higher than the previously reported host&#8208;neutral guest system to the best of our knowledge. Such a large Ka is even comparable to that of reported cryptands with secondary ammonium salts and paraquat derivatives. Thorough studies demonstrated that excellent spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) are essential for such a large Ka.

         <title>Annelated Pyridine Bases for the Selective Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acylation of primary over secondary hydroxyl groups in 1,2&#8208;ethanediols depends strongly on size effects and noncovalent interactions between the alcohol side chains and the catalysts surface.







Abstract
A set of 24 annelated derivatives of 4&#8208;diaminopyridine (DMAP) has been synthesized and tested with respect to its catalytic potential in the regioselective acylation of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates. The Lewis basicities of the catalysts as quantified through quantum chemical calculations vary due to inductive substituent effects and intramolecular stacking interactions between side chain &#960;&#8208;systems and the pyridinium core ring system. The primary over secondary hydroxyl group selectivities in catalytic acylations of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates depend on the size and the steric demand of the Lewis base and the anhydride reagent.

This study describes the synthesis of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole from a novel Diels&#8208;Alder reaction active benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The resulting molecule formed a 2D&#8208;hexagonal array in crystalline state.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and optical properties of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole, 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,8&#8208;benzobenzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]dipyrrole, which was synthesized via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a novel benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The compound formed a 2D nested hexagonal array with NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystalline state; whereas, in the solution state, it exhibited through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced emission in the solution state.

         <title>Study of [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes Obtained by Post&#8208;Synthetic Aminolysis of a Kinetically Stable Carbonate&#8208;Containing Pseudorotaxane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes the straightforward access to a stable though activated carbonate&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane building block and its respective post&#8208;synthetic conversions into either [2]rotaxane and palindromic [3]rotaxane.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and study of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that contain an ammonium as the best molecular station and carbamate moieties as secondary molecular stations. The common post&#8208;interlocking synthesis relies on the aminolysis of the N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate extremity of an activated though insulated pseudorotaxane. The N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate&#8208;based thread's extremity proved to be small enough to allow the slow slippage of the DB24C8 around the thread and large enough to allow insulation of the kinetically stable pseudorotaxane. Due to its sensitivity towards amine compounds, the activated carbonate end of the encircled thread allowed post&#8208;interlocking aminolysis&#8208;based conversion into mechanically interlocked rotaxanes by providing the same way the carbamate secondary station for the DB24C8 in the thread backbone. Translation of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle between the two molecular stations was investigated.

         <title>The Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of C3&#8208;Unprotected Indoles under Mild and Clean Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indoles are selectively N&#8208;allylated according to a salt&#8208;free nickel catalyzed reaction with allylic alcohols as co&#8208;reagents. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.







Abstract
A simple salt free and selective N&#8208;allylation of indoles with allylic alcohols has been developed. The protocol uses a catalytic amount of a nickel complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ni(cod)2 and dppf as diphosphine. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Aryl Iodides and Glycal Enones: Application in the Preparation of Dapagliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with enones derived from glycals in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under ligand&#8208;free conditions. The developed methodology was successfully applied in the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitor).







Abstract
An efficient approach for the preparation of C&#8208;1 aryl enones from aryl iodides and glycal enones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions under ligand&#8208;free conditions was developed. A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with galactal, glucal and rhamnal enones in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under mild conditions. The protecting groups, including benzyl, acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl groups, were found to be compatible under standard reaction conditions. The developed methodology was applied for the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitors). Regioselective nitration of C&#8208;1 aryl enones provides C&#8208;2 nitro aryl enones in good yields.

         <title>Selectfluor Mediated Difunctionalization of Olefins towards the Synthesis of Fluoromethylated Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Selectfluor&#8208;mediated synthesis of monofluoromethylated morpholines has been developed via the oxyfluorination of N&#8208;allylated aminoalcohols. This olefin difunctionalization strategy provides an access to a new chemical space utilizing readily available starting materials, exhibits good functional group compatibility, and can be performed on a gram scale.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxyfluorination of olefins with concomitant cyclization has been developed as a route towards monofluoromethylated morpholines. Selectfluor was employed as a fluorinating reagent as well as an oxidant to activate olefins. This strategy provides access to a new chemical space using aminoalcohol derived nitrogen&#8208;tethered alkene precursors.

         <title>Sustainable Mechanosynthesis of Biologically Active Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry contributes to the sustainable preparation of molecules in many areas of chemistry. This Review focuses on the mechanosynthesis of known APIs and biologically evaluated new entities (medicinal mechanochemistry), mostly heterocycles, metal complexes, and peptides.







Abstract
Synthetic mechanochemistry, the use of mechanical force produced by milling, grinding or extruding, as an activation technique, provides access to chemical entities of all kinds. This Review is focused on examples reported so far of known Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and effectively evaluated bioactive molecules, all prepared by mechanosynthesis. Three families of molecules are discussed: heterocyclic compounds, metal complexes and peptides. Advantages of the mechanochemistry approach are highlighted especially from a green chemistry and efficacy point of view.

         <title>Chasing Polycyclic Natural Products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;Carbotricyclic Scaffold Construction via Stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Chiral Hydrindanes and Their Boron Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindanones with cyclic and acyclic dienes was examined. By choosing acidic or thermal conditions, the diastereoselectivity on the newly formed ring could be controlled and was rationalized by high&#8208;level computations. Additionally, boron complexation of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety exhibited unexpected selectivity in the cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chiral trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas thermal conditions provided the endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 into BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave endo/exo&#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations.

     alt="Chasing Polycyclic Natural Products: 5/6/5- or 5/6/6-Carbotricyclic Scaffold Construction via Stereodivergent Diels-Alder Reaction of Chiral Hydrindanes and Their Boron Complexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Diels-Alder reaction of 4-substituted tetrahydroindanones with cyclic and acyclic dienes was examined. By choosing acidic or thermal conditions, the diastereoselectivity on the newly formed ring could be controlled and was rationalized by high-level computations. Additionally, boron complexation of the 1,3-dicarbonyl moiety exhibited unexpected selectivity in the cycloaddition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5- and 5/6/6-carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)-diastereomer under acid-catalysis, whereas thermal conditions provided the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high-level quantum-chemical computations which revealed the acid-catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3-dicarbonyls with BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels-Alder reaction of BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or BBN-chelates (from 9-BBN-OTf) gave &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-mixtures of the (&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3-dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels-Alder-reactions with furan gave furyl-substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Antibiotic Properties of Amino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatic Terpenoids Related to Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additional amino&#8208;alkyl side chain makes the difference: A series of amino&#8208;functionalized analogs of marine diterpenoids were prepared by stereoselective total synthesis and characterized with respect to their antibiotic properties. While the phenolic intermediates showed activity only against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, the amines proved to be active also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains.







Abstract
Following a concept recently introduced by Hergenrother,[6] the present study addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic (marine) natural products can be converted into more potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. To this end, phenolic mono&#8208; and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7&#8208;hydroxycalamene) as well as the diterpenes 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A were converted into amino&#8208;functionalized analogs that display either an amino&#8208;methyl or a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;ethoxy substituent in place of (or next to) the OH group. This was achieved either by Pd&#8208;catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O&#8208;alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile and subsequent reduction, or by ortho&#8208;hydroxymethylation/amination. During the study, an efficient enantioselective total synthesis of 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene (8 steps, 29&#8201;% overall yield) and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A (9 steps, 30&#8201;% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation (91&#8201;% ee) of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene as the chirogenic step. Other important C&#8722;C bond forming steps include a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling and diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization reactions. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and subsequently tested for their antibacterial properties. Some of the diterpene&#8208;derived amines showed high efficacy, not only against Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC=0.5 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/ml), but also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (E. coli K12; E. coli I&#8208;11276b; MIC=8 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/ml). This clearly supported the underlying working hypothesis.

         <title>Bisubstrate Strategies to Target Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases (MTases) use the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) to transfer a methyl group to a diverse set of biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, small molecules). These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of many biological processes. In this Review, for each type of MTase, synthetic bisubstrate inhibitors designed as substrate analogs covalently linked to a SAM analog are presented.







Abstract
Bisubstrate strategies address the lack of specificity encountered with S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues targeting methyltransferases (MTases). Specifically, a bisubstrate inhibitor mimics the transition state complex associating a substrate and the SAM methyl group donor to a particular methyltransferase. These potential inhibitors contain both parts of the substrate and the methyl group donor. In this review, bisubstrate inhibitors of several MTases including DNA, RNA, protein, catechol or nicotinamide MTases are discussed in order to evaluate the interest of these promising molecules for the development of selective therapeutics against cancers, neuropsychiatric disorders and viral infections.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Oxyfluorination/Oxydifluorination vs. Diketonization of Phthalimido&#8208;Protected Propargylamines with Selectfluor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro,&#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones is described by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were also performed.







Abstract
Alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;propargyl phthalimides were used as valuable building blocks for the selective formation of the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The key factors addressing the product selectivity control were determined. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were tested. Reaction mechanisms of the different reaction pathways are assumed.

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium(II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the recent developments of dual catalysis in rhodium (II) carbenoid chemistry, where rhodium is cooperatively working with a second transition metal (Sc/Pd/Ag/Au) or organocatalyst. The redox compatibility, turnover pathways, and the generation of unique rhodium&#8208;bound zwitterionic intermediates make rhodium an attractive partner for dual catalysis reactions to enable new transformations.







Abstract
Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Featuring a Porphyrin Scaffold: Synthesis, Optical and Biological Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrafunctionalized zinc porphyrin with coumarin is able to accumulate on cell membrane by targeting selectively membrane&#8208;bound tumour&#8208;associated CA IX/CAXII, to impair pancreas cancer cell proliferation and to kill them by photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and study of optical properties of innovative tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrins with carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in sulfonamide and coumarin series are described. The synthetic methodology relies on the preparation of the porphyrin core by condensation of azido triethyleneglycol functionalized benzaldehyde derivative with pyrrole followed by its metalation and inhibitors coupling via Huisgen click&#8208;reaction. The tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrin with coumarin moieties showed selective inhibition against tumour&#8208;associated hCA IX and hCA XII versus the cytosolic off&#8208;targets hCA I and hCA II. This compound was able to accumulate on cell membrane and to impair pancreas cancer cells (Capan&#8208;1) proliferation in normoxic conditions with LC50 of 4.5&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, its optical properties revealed efficient photosensitizing properties, leading to cancer cells death under light irradiation, making this compound a suitable candidate for photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Isoprostanoids, Isofuranoids and Isoketals &#8211; From Synthesis to Lipidomics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated fatty acid metabolites are known as isoprostanoids, isofuranoids and isoketals. These metabolites are formed under oxidative stress and have many biological roles (e.&#8201;g., biomarkers, bioactivity). This Review discusses the main chemical strategies for their synthesis as well as the analytical methods to quantify them in biological samples.







Abstract
A huge diversity of oxygenated metabolites originated from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had been discovered. Radical cascades are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites, and the radical initiation can be performed either inside the active site of an enzyme in the extracellular medium, or in membrane on phospholipids. The development of convergent and flexible chemical strategies to prepare these compounds by organic chemists, along with the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods, has boosted the knowledge regarding PUFA metabolites. Also, isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment. This Review provides a brief overview on the chemical strategies and analytical methods achieved over the past thirty years.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Conhydrine and (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Conhydrine from a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;Dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformation (CIDT) of a a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide is reported. This process provided an enantiopure stereolabile &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, which after diastereoselective carbonyl group reduction led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with excellent diastereoselectivities. These bromohydrins can be used as precursors for the synthesis of enantiopure 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl)piperidines. The utility of this methodology was illustrated by the diastereodivergent synthesis of hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine.







Abstract
Diastereodivergent syntheses of the enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine are reported. Our approach relies on efficient Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of an epimeric mixture of a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, that provided a stable &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, and diastereoselective &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide reduction that led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with high level of asymmetric induction.
