         <title>Total Synthesis of a Hypothetical Macroketone of Migrastatin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Danishefsky&#8217;s macroketone, a simplified analogue of natural product migrastatin, is one of the lead compounds with a potent cancer cell migration inhibition potential. Different biological assays suggest fascin protein as the potential target. Although it was indicated through X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystallography where the concerned macroketone analogue was found to bind in the actin&#8208;binding sites of fascin, there was a structural discrepancy, as the X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structure suggested an E&#8208;olefin along with inversion of methyl stereochemistry from that of Danishefsky&#8217;s macroketone. Here, we have accomplished the total synthesis of the &#8216;hypothetical macroketone&#8217; for the first time. The TiCl  4  mediated vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction is the key step in present synthesis. Besides, we also synthesized original Danishefsky&#8217;s macroketone using a slightly modified synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carboborylation for the Synthesis of Borylated Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interception of &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;palladium complexes in catalysis is a powerful strategy for the generation of molecular complexity. We have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes, which proceeds in good yields and moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reaction were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Propargyl Radicals in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The appearance of propargyl radicals as synthetic intermediates has increased in recent years from a structural curiosity to a frequent occurrence. This minireview covers the synthetically relevant organic chemistry involving the intermediacy of propargyl radicals. The review is organized by the process employed in radical generation, including H&#8208;atom abstraction, propargyl&#8208;X homolyses, radical addition to enynes, reduction of polar C=X bonds, reductions of stable carbocations, and metal&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. The relevant mechanisms of generation and reaction are discussed, as are applications in syntheses of target molecules of interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining organocatalyzed aldolization and reductive amination: an efficient reaction sequence for the synthesis of iminosugars</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, organocatalytic aldol reaction emerged as a powerful method for the enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, often offering more efficient, economical and environmentally friendly synthesis of chiral molecules. On the other hand, reductive amination is one of the most important reactions in synthesis of biologically active compounds and drug candidates. Coupling these two reactions results in a powerful tactical combination that allows for a rapid, stereoselective access to substituted, highly functionalized five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered  N  &#8208;heterocycles. This minireview illustrates the applicability of this approach as the key feature in syntheses of various iminosugars &#8211; a class of polyhydroxylated alkaloids with a range of interesting biological activities and high pharmacological potential.</dc:description>

Stapling and sorting: Terminal ortho&#8208;substitution and macrocyclization by imine formation/exchange stapled and sorted dynamic helical N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene units. The structure responded to acids in the reaction mixture.







Abstract
Abstract: Diformylated N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamers (4&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b) were prepared from 2,3&#8208;dichloropyrydine by palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions and deprotection. Three helical conformers of 4, corresponding to the rotations of the terminal phenylenes, were observed in 1H&#8208;NMR spectra of solution state. Chiral self&#8208;sorting of 4&#8201;a occurred by macrocyclization with para&#8208;phenylenediamine in the presence of para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The homochiral structure (PP and MM) containing two N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamer (N&#8208;oP6) moieties was revealed by 1H&#8208;NMR and mass spectra, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Using (+)&#8208; or (&#8722;)&#8208;camphorsulfonic acid was also effective in the formation of the homochiral macrocycle and also induced a chiral bias in the helical folding of N&#8208;oP6 moieties. Moreover, planar chiral self&#8208;sorting of the bridged moieties was also achieved by using 4&#8201;a and 1,5&#8208;diaminonaphthalene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling for the Efficient Preparation of Symmetric Diarylalkyne Ligands for Metal&#8208;Organic Cages**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 19, Page 2728-2735, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type synthesis is reported that enables the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages in high isolated yields and short reaction times.







Abstract
The often time&#8208;consuming and challenging multi&#8208;step synthesis of ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages is a limiting factor for the discovery and application of new cages. We report a highly efficient copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling for the preparation of symmetric diarylalkyne ligands on both a small and large scale; bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for the self&#8208;assembly of Co4L6 cages were synthesized in short reaction times and high isolated yields directly from aryl halide precursors. This one&#8208;pot method reduces the synthetic burden of ligand synthesis and will facilitate the preparation of ligands with additional functionality for applications of their corresponding cages.

         <title>Cover Feature: Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Diformylated N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene Hexamers by Macrocyclization with Aromatic Diamines (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 19/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 19, Page 2727-2727, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows macrocyclization between N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamers (N&#8208;oP6s) and para&#8208;phenylenediamines through a funnel. Before the reaction, both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helices of N&#8208;oP6s existed due to dynamic nature of the helices. As the reaction proceeds, the diamine selects N&#8208;oP6s with the same&#8208;handedness to make entropically favorable [2+2] macrocycles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Tokoro, T. Oyama et&#8197;al.

The Front Cover shows a public transportation map representing the synthetic trip from an aryl halide to a heterocyclic diarylalkyne ligand. The &#8220;multi&#8208;stop&#8221; route or conventional step&#8208;wise synthesis involves long reaction times and &#8220;stops&#8221; for the isolation of intermediates. In contrast, the reported &#8220;non&#8208;stop&#8221; route via a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling is faster and avoids the formation of Glaser products or &#8220;accidents&#8221;. Application of the ligands in the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic cages is represented by the airport. The map background represents the Kiel fjord area.

         <title>Recent Visible Light and Metal Free Strategies in [2+2] and [4+2] Photocycloadditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When aiming to build molecules with elevated molecular complexity starting from relatively simple starting materials, photochemical transformations represent an open avenue to circumvent analogous multistep procedures. &#160;Specifically, light&#8208;mediated cycloadditions remain as powerful tools to generate new bonds begotten from non&#8208;very intuitive disconnections, that alternative thermal protocols would not offer. In response to the current trend in both industrial and academic research pointing towards green and sustainable processes, several strategies that meet these requirements are currently available in the literature. &#160;This Minireview summarizes [2+2] and [4+2] photocycloadditions that do not require the use of metal photocatalysts by means of alternative strategies. It is segmented in the type of cycloaddition in order to give the reader a friendly approach and we primarily focus on the most recent developments on the field carried out using visible light, a general overview of the mechanism in each case is offered as well</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential acylation/silylation/hetero&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of nitroalkanes for the synthesis of protected hydroxyoxime derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequential acylation/silylation of nitroalkanes leads to  O  &#8209;silylated &#945;&#8208;acyloxyoximes in high yields. First step of reaction involves deprotonation of nitrocompound with sodium hydride promoted by DBU or alcohol/15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 system followed by treatment with acyl chloride.  In situ  generated acyl nitronate is further silylated by silyl triflate that triggers hetero&#8208;Claisen [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement within  N  &#8208;acyloxyenamine moiety furnishing orthogonally protected oxime derivatives. The procedure has large substrate scope for both nitroalkanes and acylating agents (acyl chlorides, chloroformates) and allows tuning of reaction conditions depending on the particular type of substrate. Application of obtained oxime derivatives in organic synthesis is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and chiral deep eutectic solvents (CDESs) in asymmetric organocatalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this minireview we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.

         <title>Catalysis in Supramolecular Systems: the Case of Gel Phases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular gels are a fascinating class of materials, originated by the self&#8208;assembly of low molecular weight molecules. Underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they find application in a diverse range of fields. Among these, supramolecular gels can be considered as organized, non&#8208;conventional reaction media, able to influence reactivity in a radically different way, compared with what happens in solution. This short review will be focused on this aspect, covering literature from 2010 onwards, addressing the application of supramolecular gels as reaction media. In particular, in the first section we explore organocatalytic reactions in gel phase, with wide synthetic relevance, such as aldol and Mannich reactions as well as Friedel Crafts or ester hydrolysis processes. Subsequently, focus is laid on metal&#8208;catalysed reactions, among which relevance is given to widely used reactions like cross&#8208;coupling and click reactions. Then, the final sections cover the use of supramolecular gels as reaction media for photo&#8208; and biocatalysed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Development of Organocatalytic Asymmetric Reduction of Carbonyls and Imines Using Silicon Hydrides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones and ketimines represents one of the most important and practical chemical transformations toward the synthesis of valuable chiral alcohols and amines. Among the existing strategies, organocatalyzed asymmetric reduction of carbonyls and imines using silicon hydrides is attractive due to low&#8208;cost, chemical stability, and easy handling in experiments. In this review, we wish to highlight the recent progress made in the past fifteen years in this field. Four catalytic systems of different activation modes are presented and discussed in detail. We aim to help shed light on common features that enable highly enantioselective silicon hydride reductions via organocatalysis and provide the design principles for the development of more effective catalytic systems .</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition between thienopyridine/thienopyrazine carboxylic acids and alkynes, triggered by C&#8208;H activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, a number of metal&#8208;catalyzed technologies for the functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds in carbonaceous aromatic substrates have been developed. However, similar reactions with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic precursors are more challenging and have been much less developed. Herein we report for the first time catalytic formal cycloadditions of  N,S  &#8208;heterocycles featuring carboxylic acid substituents, with unsaturated partners (alkynes). The reaction, which works with different symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes, produces appealing tricyclic &#593;&#8208;pyrones in a straightforward manner. The optimized conditions established for a model reaction employing thieno[2,3&#8208;  b  ]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid as substrate, involved the use of Ag  2  CO  3  /AgSbF  6  as additives, and proved to be general for different alkynes. Moreover, analogous cycloadditions using thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid and thieno[2,3&#8208;  b  ]pyrazine&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid were successfully developed. Overall, this catalytic technology allows to build, in a single step, an interesting variety of pharmaceutically relevant tricyclic &#593;&#8208;pyrones exhibiting nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Protosilylation/Protoborylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroallenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective protosilylation and protoborylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford tertiary and secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallyl compounds have been developed. The reactions proceed under very mild reaction conditions and provided the corresponding products in high efficiency.







Abstract
We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford gem&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes.

Not only monosubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes but also disubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes could react well with silaboronate (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The protocol is simple and efficient to construct compounds which contain tertiary/secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. Moreover, diverse organofluorine compounds can be converted from these organoboronates and silanes.

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes.

         <title>Study of Rhodamine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Organic Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives were used as fluorescent probes in the detection and real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates in different solvents. Mechanism studies reveal a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring with the presence or absence of radicals.







Abstract
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives for the detection of radical intermediates in organic reactions were synthesized and used as fluorescent probes over a wide range of solvents. The mechanistic studies confirm a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring. Compound 21 can be used to support the radical mechanism or in the real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates.

         <title>The use of Potassium/Sodium Nitrite as a Nitrosating Agent&#160;in the Electrooxidative N&#8208;nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein on the electrochemical N&#8208;nitrosation of secondary amines using widely available sodium/potassium nitrite as nitrosating agents. This approach not only eliminates the need for using a combination of sodium/potassium and strong acid but also has good functional group tolerance. The reaction is compatible with the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds and could be conducted in gram scale with high reaction efficiency. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the N&#8208;nitrosation occurs via the anodic oxidation of KNO  2  into an NO  2  radical which is then transformed into an NO  +  cation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ugly Duckling Metamorphosis: The Ammonia/Formaldehyde Couple Made Possible in Ugi Reactions.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonia/formaldehyde couple (the ugly duckling in Ugi reactions) was finally made possible using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as an efficient formaldehyde surrogate. Various NH&#8208;free Ugi adducts were obtained in moderate to excellent yields and two of them were converted to diketopiperazines (DKPs).







Abstract
Ugi reactions are still a challenge when the concomitant use of ammonia and formaldehyde is required. Herein, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as a singular key for the employment of these two simple starting materials in the Ugi reaction. Acylaminoacetamide derivatives were prepared in good to excellent yields by this new methodology. The scope and optimization of the reaction conditions were investigated. This novel methodology was successfully applied in the synthesis of two different diketopiperazines (DKPs) using the Ugi/Deprotection+Activation/Cyclization (UDAC) method. A continuous flow approach was also used in this methodology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

Bio&#8208;based methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) has been oxidized to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Densely functionalized methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate is stable at low temperatures but slowly dimerizes by a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Accordingly, methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been developed as a new dienophile in the classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes







Abstract
Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by the addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, derived from glycine Schiff bases with chiral tridentate ligands, have been used as powerful tools for the synthesis of structurally diverse tailor&#8208;made amino acids. In this manuscript, asymmetric alkylation reaction between chiral nucleophilic glycine derived Ni&#8208;complex and 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine has been developed under convenient conditions, which affords the corresponding alkylated Ni&#8208;complex in 74% yield and excellent diastereoselectivity (only one isomer). This reaction features convenient conditions and completely controlled diastereoselectivity, which provides a highly valuable approach for asymmetric synthesis of 7&#8208;aza&#8208;tryptophan.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese &#8208; Catalyzed Regioselective Direct C3 &#8208; Phosphinoylation of 2 &#8208; Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient and regioselective manganese&#8208;catalyzed radical oxidative direct C&#8722;P bond coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones and secondary phosphine oxides was developed. The  C3  &#8208;selective phosphinoylation was conveniently achieved through a combination of a substoichiometric manganese and a persulfate oxidant under mild conditions, giving various 3&#8208;phosphinoylated pyridone products in moderate to high yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to involve a radical pathway induced by catalytically active Mn  3+  species.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their hetero&#8208; and macrocyclic derivatives: preparation and synthetic applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylo&#173;nitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetami&#173;des, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Synthesis of 1&#8208;Glycosyl Thioacetates and Its Application in the Synthesis of Thioglucoside Gliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved method to synthesize 1&#8208;glycosyl thioacetates was developed, where per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycoses were allowed to directly react with potassium thioacetate (KSAc) in the presence of BF  3  .  Et  2  O in ethyl acetate under mild conditions. This method not only overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional one&#8208;step method, which is that the odorous and toxic thioacetic acid has to be used, but also overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional two&#8208;step method, which is that the unstable intermediate, glycosyl halide, has to be synthesized from the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycose in advance. Based on this, the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl disulfide and the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol were efficiently synthesized in high yields (91% and 90% respectively) starting from per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycoses in two&#8208;step without the need to isolate intermediate products. Through metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol with aryl&#8208;iodide under very mild conditions, two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were efficiently synthesized in high yields for the first time. These two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were further confirmed to be stable to hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;glucosidase.</dc:description>

Based on this, the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl disulfide and the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol were efficiently synthesized in high yields (91% and 90% respectively) starting from per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycoses in two&#8208;step without the need to isolate intermediate products. Through metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol with aryl&#8208;iodide under very mild conditions, two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were efficiently synthesized in high yields for the first time. These two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were further confirmed to be stable to hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;glucosidase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Hydroxy hydroperoxides (&#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy alcohols) are interesting chemical platforms, notably for the preparation of 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, that are key features of numerous bioactive products such as artemisinin. In this review, the main synthetic methods to prepare &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are presented, such as the photooxidation of allylic alcohols with singlet oxygen and the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with H  2  O  2  . The main applications of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are also detailed, including their peracetalization to 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, their use as epoxidating agents and their fragmentation to carbonyl compounds. A final section is dedicated to the general characteristics and practical aspects of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides, including their stability, safety and characterization through spectroscopic means.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two highly emissive donor&#8208;acceptor type organoboron dyes, based on carbazole donor and benzothiazole&#8208;fused oxadiazaborinine acceptor, were designed and synthesized. The compounds demonstrated high positive solvatofluorochromism in solutions, caused by intramolecular charge transfer. Such carbazolyl&#8208;containing  N,  O  &#8208;chelated organoboron dyes exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties: in tetrahydrofuran/water mixture with the high water amount, they formed highly emissive nanoaggregates. Both materials demonstrated efficient solid&#8208;state emission in the crystalline and thin film state (PLQY of up to 48%), as well as significant mechanofluorochromic properties (&#916;&#955;  em  = 30&#8208;38 nm). Moreover, compound with unsubstituted carbazole unit was isolated as two distinct crystalline polymorphs with different photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt  3  /NEt  3  .HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first order in catalyst and zero order in aldehyde over a broad range of aldehyde concentrations. The observed reaction rate is higher for catalysts bearing N&#8208;aryl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. A concurrent, NHC&#8208;independent substrate isomerization was also observed and found to demonstrate a first order dependence on aldehyde concentration. The reported data are consistent with deprotonation to form the Breslow intermediate being turnover&#8208;limiting in this process.</dc:description>

         <title>Strigolactones: Phytohormones with Promising Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Brown allylation: application to the synthesis of natural products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric allylation represents an important reaction applied in the natural product synthesis. The stereoselective introduction of an allyl group allows to obtain versatile chiral building blocks, which may further undergo various transformations due to the presence of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. In this review, we address the Brown allylation, which involves the conversion of aldehydes into homoallylic alcohols using B&#8208;allyldiisopinocampheylborane as a chiral reagent. We provide a comprehensive overview of the reaction and highlight its application in the synthesis of natural products, while assessing its performance in comparison to other approaches. The total of 17 syntheses have been described, including the synthesis of biologically active macrolides Disciformycin B, Biselyngbyolide B, Peloruside A and Gliomasolide A, bis&#8208;piperidine alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;Anaferine and Dysoxylactam A.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6a,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.

         <dc:description>MgX 2 &#8208;catalyzed annulation of methylenecyclopropanes with acyl cyanoalkenes was accomplished to give oxaspiro[2.5]octenes in excellent yields. The reaction proceeded via a rare intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition of Mg enolate. The oxaspiro ring was transformed into 4 H &#8208;pyran at a higher temperature in the presence of MgX 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Difluorinated &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfones via Detrifluoroacetylative Mannich Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric detrifluoroacetylative Mannich reactions between &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl  gem  &#8208;diols and fluoroalkyl imines have been developed under operationally convenient conditions. Varieties of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl  gem  &#8208;diols and fluoroalkyl imines are well tolerated with the corresponding &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;amino sulfone products generated in moderate to excellent yields as well as high diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be reproduced on gram&#8208;scale with uncompromised yield and stereochemical outcome. The synthetic value of the products is demonstrated by two transformations by means of desulfonylation and removal of the sulfinyl protecting&#8208;group.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characteriza&#173;tion, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hetera&#173;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Cyclization: A &#8220;Molecular Claw&#8221; Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion via the C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, as most current peptide syntheses use C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization.







Abstract
Both naturally occurring and artificial cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications due to the improvement of their enzymatic stability, cell permeability, and pharmacological activity compared to their linear counterparts. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, where linear peptides are cyclized via C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, since most current peptide synthesis has been dominated by the use of C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization. The use of an amide &#8220;N&#8208;tag&#8221; instead of the general terminal C&#8208;tag enables an effective head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization on&#8208;support. The key for successful cyclization is a tagging position that enables the center of the peptide to be grabbed.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of gem&#8208;Dibromovinyl BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY derivatives bearing gem&#8208;dibromovinyl moieties (&#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole rings, directly or through phenyl spacers) undergo efficiently Sonogashira and Stille Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling resulting in the formation of 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products. A pronounced red shift of absorption maxima occurs when substituents are at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;p&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.

         <title>Addressing the target identification and accelerating the repositioning of anti&#8208;inflammatory/anti&#8208;cancer organic compounds by computational approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of computational chemistry techniques has led to notable advances in the structural and pharmacological investigation of organic compounds. The combination of quantum mechanical (QM) approaches with experimental methods (e.g., NMR spectroscopy) contributed to the configurational and conformational structural assignment of the investigated items. Once this information was obtained,  in silico  tools can be employed for assessing the pharmacological features of natural and synthetic molecules, especially those lacking precise information about their interacting macromolecules. With this aim, we developed and implemented the Inverse Virtual Screening (IVS) computational methodology for addressing the target identification task. This minireview focuses on the key technical information and on successful examples about the convenient and fast use of such computational methods in the frame of the drug repositioning and the discovery of anti&#8208;inflammatory/anti&#8208;cancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions by Intermolecular Cooperative Thiourea/Oxime Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of intermolecular cooperative thiourea/oxime hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis for improving and accelerating asymmetric aminocatalysis is presented. The two readily available hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating catalysts operates in synergy with a chiral amine catalyst to accomplish highly stereoselective transformations. The synergistic catalyst systems simultaneously activates both electrophiles, nucleophiles and makes the transformations more chemo&#8208; and stereoselective. This was exemplified by performing co&#8208;catalytic enantioselective direct intermolecular &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of aldehydes, direct aldol reactions, and asymmetric conjugate reactions, which gave the corresponding products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise highlight of the main types of chromophoric systems obtained in the authors&#8217; and other laboratories  via  biomimetic chemistry or synthetic manipulation of nature&#8208;inspired  o  &#8208;quinones is the primary aim of this Minireview. Following oxidative conversion of a variety of natural catechol substrates like DOPA, dopamine, 5&#8208;  S  &#8208;cysteinyldopa and caffeic acid, in the presence of suitable additives, a remarkable variety of chromophoric systems can be produced, which display specific optical and electronic properties,  e.g.  acidichromism, solvatochromism or strong emission upon excitation. Such properties can be tailored for specific applications through rational synthetic manipulations and/or fine&#8208;tuning  via  non&#8208;covalent and supramolecular interactions. Practical access routes to the reported  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;derived chromophoric systems are illustrated along with the main prospective applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophore Multimerization as an Efficient Approach towards Bright Protein Labels</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increase of the number of fluorophores per protein label (F/P) leads to increase of the brightness, however at relatively low F/P ratios. Beyond a certain F/P ratio, brightness starts to drop due to significant fluorophore self&#8208;quenching. To tackle this issue, novel approaches for multimerization of fluorescent&#8197;dyes have been developed, which are summarized in this Minireview.







Abstract
Cell analysis techniques like flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are widely used to explore cells in real&#8208;time and provide important insights into a variety of cellular processes. These techniques require bright and specific staining reagents to generate strong fluorescence signal and enable reliable read&#8208;out, making the choice of fluorescent labels a key aspect of experimental design. Much research has been done in the field of fluorophore development to generate bright small&#8208;molecule&#8197;dyes, fluorescent proteins, and emitting nanoparticles. However, it remains challenging to modify biomolecules with multiple emitters and avoid self&#8208;quenching of such fluorophores at the same time. Herein, we present advances in multimerization&#8208;based methods for the generation of fluorescent labels with high brightness and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy applications.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Mustard carbonate analogues as sustainable reagents for the aminoalkylation of phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,N  &#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moiety can be found in numerous scaffolds of macromolecules, catalysts and especially pharmaceuticals. Common synthetic procedures for its the incorporation in a substrate relies on the use of a nitrogen mustard gas or on multistep syntheses featuring chlorine hazardous/toxic chemistry. Herein is reported a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of aminoalkyl chain via dialkyl carbonate (&#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate) chemistry into different phenolic substrates. This new direct alcohol substitution procedure avoids the use of chlorine chemistry, is efficient on numerous pharmacophore scaffolds with good to quantitative yield. The cytotoxicity via MTT of the &#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate, key intermediate of this synthetic approach, was also evaluated and compared with its alcohol precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular (Hetero)Michael Additions in Desymmetrization Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrization reaction by means of an intramolecular (hetero)Michael addition is a useful strategy for the creation of complex polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with the generation of multiple stereocenters in a very simple manner. The intramolecular addition of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles of prochiral substrates bearing electronically deficient olefins takes place in the presence of organocatalysts, such as chiral primary and secondary amines, NHCs, ureas, thioureas and BINOL phosphoric acid derivatives reaching high levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The most important bottleneck of this methodology is the design and synthesis of the starting materials, which compromises its application. To date, the majority of the examples are related to the use of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedione derivatives</dc:description>

Neither the molecular sieve pore size nor amount of NIS activator was found to have an effect on the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;ratio in reaction with L&#8208;menthol as glycosyl acceptor. Increasing concentration and the amount of triflic acid catalyst, however was found to increase the &#946;&#8208;selectivity in certain cases. Also, lowering temperature was found to have a strong effect on the glycosylation outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free sp3&#8208;sp3 Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling Between Benzylboronic Esters and Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free coupling reaction of benzylboronic esters and alkyl halides has been developed. Both alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were found to be competent substrates with the nucleophilic boronate intermediate generated from the combination of benzylboronic ester and an alkyllithium. Good chemoselectivity was observed for the reaction with the alkyl bromide in substrates with a second electrophile present. Both secondary and tertiary benzylboronic esters were effective nucleophiles in the reaction with primary alkyl halides. Mechanistic observations are consistent with a radical mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A structure&#8208;activity investigation on modified analogues of an argininocalixarene based non&#8208;viral gene vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene  1  has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different type of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by a rather weak toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Buckyball as an Electron Donor in a Dyad of C60 and Xanthene Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully achieved the synthesis of C  60  &#8211;xanthlium,  X60_NTf  2  , where fullerene is an  electron donor  and xanthlium is an  electron acceptor  . When the precursor compound  X60&#8208;OH  was excited at 550 nm, the C  60  emission was observed at 715 nm. On the other hand, the fluorescence of  X60_NTf  2  was completely quenched under the same conditions, suggesting that photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer (ET) occurred from the singlet excited state of C  60  . The electrochemical measurement proved that the  X60_NTf  2  is exothermically possible of ET reaction from  1  C  60  * to xanthylium to form C  60  &#65381;+  . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the acceptor ability of the xanthylium by showing that the coefficients of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were on xanthene moiety. This is a well&#8208;arranged model compound to investigate the properties of transiently generated fullerene radical cations.</dc:description>

         <title>[Zinc(II)(Pyridine&#8208;Containing Ligand)] Complexes as Single&#8208;Component Efficient Catalyst for Chemical Fixation of CO2 with Epoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between epoxides and CO  2  to yield cyclic carbonates is efficiently promoted under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions (0.5 mol% catalyst loading, 0.8 MPa, 125 &#176;C) by zinc(II) complexes of pyridine containing macrocyclic ligands (Pc&#8208;L pyridinophanes). The zinc complexes have been fully characterised, including X&#8208;ray structural determination. The [Zn(II)X(Pc&#8208;L)]X complexes showed good solubility in several polar solvents, including cyclic carbonates. The scope of the reaction under solvent&#8208;free conditions has been studied and good to quantitative conversions with excellent selectivities have been obtained starting from terminal epoxides. When solvent&#8208;free conditions were not possible (solid epoxides or low solubility of the catalyst in the oxirane) the use of cyclic carbonates as solvents has been investigated with success. The remarkable stability of the catalytic system has been demonstrated by a series of consecutive runs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Lewis base &#8211; Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalyzed Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction of cyclic sulfamidate imines with acrylate&#8208;type Michael acceptors has been developed. The combination of equimolecular catalytic amounts of DABCO and acetic acid proved highly efficient, and tolerates well a wide range of Michael acceptors and substituted 6&#8208;membered ring sulfamidate imines, as well as a sultam derivative. The reaction provides a straightforward access to sulfamidates bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated chains, which allows for the further functionalization of the products.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>Fluorene derivatives bearing two to seven phthalimidomethyl groups: Syntheses, crystal structures and conversion to amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene derivatives containing four to seven phthalimidomethyl groups (1,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;isoindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl groups) were prepared from 9  H  &#8208;fluorene, 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorene as well as from 2,7&#8208; and 2,4,7&#8208;functionalized 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorenes by using the conditions of the  Tscherniac&#8208;Einhorn  reaction. By reacting the 9,9&#8208;diethyl substituted fluorenes with  N  &#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phthalimide the 2,4,6,7&#8208; and 2,3,4,6,7&#8208;substituted derivatives were obtained. In the absence of the ethyl groups, as in the case of 9  H  &#8208;fluorene, the formation of the sixfold and sevenfold substituted compounds was observed (1,2,3,5,7,8&#8208; and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;substituted fluorenes). It should be noted that one position in the bay region of the fluorene skeleton (position 4 or 5) remains unsubstituted in each of the prepared four&#8208; to sevenfold substituted 9  H  &#8208;fluorenes. The conversion of the phthalimidomethyl substituted 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorenes into the corresponding amines takes place with excellent yields. The solid state structures of the compounds bearing phthalimidomethyl groups were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The manuscript provides information about the synthetic routes to new fluorene derivatives and their molecular structures as well as the patterns of noncovalent interactions in the crystalline state.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Optimized synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers and their assembly into PNA oligomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous advancement of application of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers encouraged exploration of rapid and efficient synthesis of PNA monomers and oligomers. Among the PNA monomers developed, only a few are commonly used in automated PNA synthesis. Here, we report short and efficient protocols suitable for large&#8208;scale synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers with advantageous solubility properties; these also facilitate purification due to the traceless nature of the Boc protecting group. Initially, several coupling reagents were screened for assembly of a pentamer containing all four nucleobases, and then the most promising reagents were tested in the synthesis of a decamer. The Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected monomers proved compatible with both manual synthesis and assembly on an automated peptide synthesizer at room temperature or at 40&#176;C. As compared to the commonly used coupling agent &#160;(1&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridinium 3&#8208;oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU) both 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and [ethyl cyano(hydroxyimino)acetato&#8208;O  2  ]tri&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinylphosphonium hexa&#8208;fluorophosphate (PyOxim) proved more favorable, with the latter being superior. A previously reported side reaction of guanine bases in the presence of benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) was not observed with the phosphonium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects Despite Evidence for Catalyst Aggregation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One might think that the absence of a non&#8208;linear effect (NLE) might necessarily mean that only monomeric complexes catalyze a studied enantioselective reaction. Herein, a counter&#8208;example using an ephedrine&#8208;derived ligand in asymmetric alkylzinc additions is shown. The system is catalyzed by both monomers and dimers, although no NLE is apparent.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt2 to benzaldehyde with (1R,2S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs. catalyst loading and NMR investigations (1H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs. ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the absence of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model, which we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs. ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

         <dc:description>We have optimized a synthetic approach to (&#177;)&#8208;Ferrugine in 8 steps starting from 5&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;1&#8208;ene and using the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed pseudotransannular ring opening of the epoxide derived from this cycloheptene as the key step for the construction of the 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane central core. While attempting the enantioselective synthesis of this natural product from enantiopure 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane we have found that this compound shows a pronounced tendency to racemize  via  an achiral symmetric aziridinium intermediate. This racemization side process has been studied in detail using both experimental and computational methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Synthesis, cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal evaluation of ent&#8208;beyerene and ent&#8208;kaurene derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease endemic of tropical and subtropical countries. Current pharmacologic treatments have serious drawbacks. For these reasons, we need new and improved medical treatments. On the other side, natural products have been a valuable source of bioactive molecules, but unlike other products of natural origin, diterpenoids are molecules with only a few studies as antiparasitic drugs. Continuing our work on syntheses of beyerenes, and focusing on obtaining more compounds with antiparasitic activity, we describe in this work the syntheses and activity of several  ent  &#8208;beyerene and  ent  &#8208;kaurene type of compounds against CL, and also their toxicity. Utilizing classical reactions such as Grignard, Mitsunobu and Williamson, among others, it was possible to modify rings A and D of  ent  &#8208;beyerenes, specifically C&#8208;19 on ring A, and C&#8208;15 and C&#8208;16 on ring D. A total of 40 new compounds were obtained, 21 of them being active against  Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis  with median effective concentration (EC  50  ) values less than 25.0 mg/mL and of these with EC  50  values ranging from 1.8 to 7.1 mg/mL and Selectivity Index (SI) varying from 1.1 to 5.1. All compounds showed to be highly cytotoxic at concentrations less than 100 mg/mL, except compound  37  that was cytotoxic at 279.7 mg/mL and moderately active against  L. braziliensis  (EC  50  = 33.5 mg/mL and an SI of 8.4. All active compounds were  ent  &#8208;beyerene type.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  An approach to 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isostere of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained in multigram scale through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A convenient methodology for constructing 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isoster of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;bifunctionalized difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic precursor &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane. The target compounds and intermediates were prepared by short reaction sequences (6&#8211;10 steps) on a multigram scale (up to 0.47 kg).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
