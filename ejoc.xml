      <dc:description>Photoorganocatalysis constitutes a powerful domain of photochemistry and organic synthesis. The scaffold of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]quinolinoles exhibits interesting and potent inhibition against various enzymes, making them really promising pharmaceutical targets. Herein, we describe a photochemical methodology for the reaction of  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylanilines with  N  &#8208;substituted maleimides, utilizing benzaldehyde as the photoinitiator. A variety of substituted  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylanilines and  N  &#8208;substituted maleimides were converted into the corresponding adducts in moderate to high yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Convergent Domino Cyclization: Oxidative [3+1+1] Annulation for One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinoline&#8208;4,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;oxazoles from Methyl Azaarenes, Benzoins and NH4OAc</title>
      <dc:description>An oxidative [3+1+1] convergent domino cyclization is disclosed. This protocol enables to get quinoline, quinoxaline, quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one and benzo[d]thiazole attached 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted oxazoles from methyl azaarenes, benzoins and NH  4  OAc in the presence of iodine and molecular sieves without any metal catalyst. The reaction features wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and easily available substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Benzotriazoles via [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azides and Arynes in Flow</title>
      <dc:description>A method for the metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzotriazoles in flow is reported. Using azides and in situ generated arynes, benzotriazoles are formed in a [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Employing different substitution patterns of the azide and aryne coupling partners, a modular access to benzotriazoles is provided. Thermal strain of hazardous azides and accumulation of reactive intermediates is minimized by short reaction times in flow, improving the safety profile of the process. The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin.

      <dc:description>The title nonplanar electron acceptor ( 1 ) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN).

X&#8208;ray analyses of 1 , 2 , and their CT crystals revealed that the Se &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN.

      <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Iodide</title>
      <dc:description>In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI  2  is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI  2  . This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur Tuning of [1,3]&#8208;Dioxolo[4.5&#8208;f]benzodioxole (DBD) Fluorescent Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The replacement of oxygen by sulfur atoms of [1,3]&#8208;dioxolo[4.5&#8208;  f  ]benzodioxole (DBD) fluorescent dyes is an efficient way to adjust the photophysical properties (sulfur tuning). While previously developed S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes exhibit considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission wavelength, the heavy atom effect of four sulfur atoms cause low fluorescence quantum yields and short fluorescence lifetimes. Herein we demonstrate that the replacement of less than four sulfur atoms (S  1  &#8208;DBD, 1,2&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD, and 1,4&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes) permits a fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties. In some cases, a similar influence on the wavelength without the detrimental effect on the quantum yields and lifetimes is observed. Furthermore, the synthetic accessibility of S  1  &#8208; and S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes is improved, compared with S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes. For coupling with biomolecules a series of reactive derivatives of the new dyes were developed (azides, OSu esters, alkynes, maleimides).</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric guest binding in chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. The zirconium compound was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displays a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery the cooperativity factors &#945; (= 4K1/K2) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.</dc:description>

      <title>An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold</title>
      <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied widely as a bioisosteric component of drugs.

      <title>Fungicide precursor racemization kinetics for deracemization in complex systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the racemization area, the keto&#8208;enol equilibrium is a major player when it comes to racemizing &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The racemization kinetics in the co&#8208;crystal induced deracemization of a fungicide precursor is complex as next to the racemization catalyst, which is a base, an acidic co&#8208;former is used to ensure the crystallization of the co&#8208;crystal. Here we show that understanding of the racemization kinetics of the target compound is of key importance for optimization of the co&#8208;crystallization based deracemization process. The racemization rates in solution as a function of solvent and base concentration were determined by measuring the decreasing enrichment of the chiral ketone due to racemization over time, using a polarimeter set&#8208;up with a continuous recycling loop through the polarimeter cell. The established racemization kinetics model aligns with the experimental data giving access to the intrinsic racemization rate constant. The proposed mechanism is first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess of the target compound and the base&#8208;catalyst concentration. The solvent is shown to affect the racemization constant, with protic solvents increasing this rate substantially. Finally, we observed the presence of the chiral acid co&#8208;former to alter the reaction mechanism albeit remaining first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess. Though more complex, the mechanism still followed Arrhenius law, providing key information on the impact of temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Front Cover: Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a crossroad, metaphorically representing the possibility of a phenol to be oxidized to an ortho&#8208; or a para&#8208;quinone depending on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs &#955;5&#8208;iodane). However, things are not so straightforward, since prototropic equilibria and valence tautomerization can provide a diversion from the selected pathway. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#160;Caprioglio, G.&#160;Appendino et al.

      <title>Photoinduced decarboxylative radical addition reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of peptide substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors.

      <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

      <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.
