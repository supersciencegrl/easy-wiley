         <title>Catalytic C(sp2)&#8211;H&#160;Trifluoroethylation of Indoles via Iron&#8208;Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmacological properties of a bioactive molecule can be improved significantly by placing a fluoroalkyl group on its scaffold. However, direct stitching of fluoroalkyl groups to aromatic compounds via C&#8211;H bond activation or insertion reaction is a difficult task, thus challenging and of high demand. Herein, an alternative to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, we describe an uncharted strategy for selective and efficient trifluoroethylation of indole that relies on iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation of aromatic compounds and proceeds via Fe(III)&#8208;carbene insertion into C(sp2)&#8211;H bond of indole using trifluoroacetaldehyde N&#8208;triftosylhydrazone as a carbene precursor and FeTPPCl as catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of cryptophanes: recent advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the latest developments in the synthesis of cryptophane host molecules since the publication of the last extensive review by Brotin and Dutasta in 2009. The literature has been categorized according to the synthetic method for generating the cryptophane core and we also emphasize emerging late&#8208;stage functionalization approaches. The synthetic strategies towards cryptophanes can be broadly categorized into the well&#8208;established direct&#8208; (two&#8208;step), template&#8208; and coupling (or capping) methods. The examples covered in this review mainly highlight template&#8208;based synthesis, coupling approaches and late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphinates via Thiourea Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioureas catalyze the reaction of phosphonites with in situ&#8208;generated isoquinolinium salts to give C and P&#8208;stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates in high enantioselectivity (up to 96%) and yield (up to 95%). Low diastereoselectivity was obtained and this is rationalized in the context of a mechanistic proposal involving anion&#8208;binding catalysis of the P&#8208;C bond formation step followed by uncatalyzed Arbuzov collapse. The scope of the reaction, including a g&#8208;scale example, was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective (8+3)&#8208;Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Tropothione</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Reactions of dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates, used as representatives of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, with tropothione were carried out in the presence of catalytic scandium triflate, under mild conditions (CH2Cl2 solution, rt). The anticipated (8+3)&#8208;cycloaddition products, cycloheptatriene fused thiopyrans, were obtained in good to excellent yields. Cycloadditions occurred with complete diastereoselectivity and in all cases single diastereomers were formed. Structures of isolated cycloadducts were established based on spectroscopic data and in two cases they were unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In contrast to an analogous (8+3)&#8208;cycloaddition reported for parent tropone, which was performed in the presence of Ni(ClO4)2, no 1,3&#8208;H shift leading to products possessing a CH2 moiety located within the seven&#8208;membered ring was observed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>delta&#8208;nitro dienes were successfully synthesized and converted to delta&#8208;nitroalkenes with complete chemo and regioselectivity. The enantioselective organocatalytic reduction was also accomplished and afforded the product in up to 97% e.e. The chiral nitro alkene was further elaborated and employed as starting material in a stereoselective cyclization reaction that led to an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring 5 contiguous stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new sesquiterpene&#8208;hydroquinone hybrids, saromacrophorins A&#8722;C (1&#8722;3) and one known derivative (4) were isolated from the deep&#8208;sea&#8208;derived fungus Sarocladium terricola 494a. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive analyses of 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and ECD calculations. Noteworthily, compound 1 is a rare 5',6'&#8208;dihydroxymacrophorin and compound 3 is the first example of macrophorin possessing 4&#8242;S&#8208;configuration. Compound 4 showed potent anti&#8208;food allergic activity with an IC50 value of 18.9 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Tandem Oxidation&#8210;Organocatalyzed Aromatic C&#8210;S Bond Functionalization: Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzenesulfonamide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated a visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8210;organo catalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8210;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8210;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8210;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8210;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well. A radical mediated mechanism was proposed for the tandem oxidation&#8210;organocatalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol.</dc:description>

One analog each of the naturally occurring N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;(polyenoyl)pyridine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones (&#8722;)&#8208;tennelin, bassianin, and (&#8722;)&#8208;farinosone B was synthesized, the structural difference being that our targets contain pentyl groups and a disubstituted C=C bond where the natural products display sec&#8208;butyl groups and a trisubstituted C=C bond. We developed unsaturated &#969;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketothioesters as conjunctive reagents and closed the rings by modified Dieckmann cyclizations.







Abstract
Fully enolized N&#8208;hydroxypyridine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones with a 3&#8208;enoyl or 3&#8208;dienoyl or 3&#8208;trienoyl substituent (collectively named &#8220;3&#8208;polyenoyl substituent&#8220; hereafter) define the core of a number of &#948;&#8208;lactam natural products. We developed a strategy for establishing such motifs in a convergent and stereoselective manner. The polyenoyl moiety of our target molecules stemmed from simply, two&#8208;fold or three&#8208;fold unsaturated and almost completely enolized &#969;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketothioesters, two of which were obtained for the first time. The N&#8208;bound hydroxy group of our target structures originated from an O&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxybenzyl)&#8208;protected &#946;&#8208;(hydroxylamino)propionic ester, first obtained in this study, too. The mentioned building blocks were combined intermolecularly by a thioester hydroxylaminolysis and thereafter intramolecularly by a Williams&#8208;type Dieckmann cyclization. The resulting N&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxybenzyloxy)dihydropyridine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones were oxidized with CBrCl3 and DBU. The N&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxybenzyloxy)pyridine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones gained thereby were debenzylated &#8211; jointly with their (4&#8208;methoxybenzyl) aryl ether moiety &#8211; with F3CCO2H. This liberated the target structures.

         <title>Facile (3+2) Cycloaddition between an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin and Nitrous Oxide at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that a gem&#8208;dimethylated N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) reacts with N2O at ambient pressure and room temperature to give an imidazolone and an azine formed from intermediately generated 2&#8208;diazopropane. The in situ formation of diazopropane was successfully proven by its engagement in a facile cycloddition with norbornene. According to our studies, the reaction sequence consists of a rate&#8208;determining (3+2) cycloaddition between the NHO and N2O, followed by a cycloreversion that releases the diazoalkane. This mechanistic proposal is supported by DFT calculations. Eyring analysis using temperature&#8208;variable 1H NMR spectroscopy allowed us to determine the activation parameters of the initial (3+2) cycloaddition (&#916;&#8225;H = 11.2(4) kcal/mol, &#916;&#8225;S = &#8208;39.8(13) e.u., 293&#8208;308 K). Frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;bond of the NHO decisively facilitates the cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of 2&#8208;Methylindoles Using Solid Calcium Carbide as a Substitute for Gaseous Acetylene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the construction of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonylindoles and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonylindoles using solid calcium carbide as an alkyne source and o&#8208;sulfonamidobenzaldehyde hydrazones or o&#8208;sulfonamidoacetophenone hydrazones as starting materials is described. This protocol has the salient feature of the use of an inexpensive, abundant and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solid alkyne source, effectively avoiding the use of flammable and explosive gaseous acetylene as an original alkyne source. Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, wide substrate scope, high yield, and simple workup procedures are advantages of this method. The transformation can also be carried out on a gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of (2&#215;C2+C&#8217;2)&#215;n Molecular Complexity Using a Sequence of Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations with Calcium Carbide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents synthetic approaches within CaC2 chemistry, introducing the 2&#215;C2&#8208;to&#8208;C4 and (2&#215;C2+C&#8217;2)&#215;n assembly concepts. Using Pt catalysis, carbon from two calcium carbide molecules was transferred to an organic C4 fragment. Supplemented with Pd catalysis, the described methodology offers a novel pathway for controlled molecular assembly and polymer synthesis.







Abstract
Constructing molecular complexity from simple precursors stands as a cornerstone in contemporary organic synthesis. Systems harnessing easily accessible starting materials, which offer control over stereochemistry and support a modular assembly approach, are particularly in demand. In this research, we utilized calcium carbide, presenting a sustainable pathway to generate acetylene gas &#8211; a fundamental C2 building block. We performed a Pt&#8208;facilitated linkage of two C2&#8208;units sourced from two calcium carbide molecules to craft a conjugated C4 core with exceptional stereoselectivity. As a benchmark, we selected the synthesis of (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, executing it in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. Compartmentalization of the reactions across these chambers resulted in the desired product in 85% yield. Furthermore, high&#8208;energy polymeric substances were derived by marrying the molecular intricacy between (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene and calcium carbide, underpinning a unique C4+C2 assembly blueprint. The structure and morphology of the polymeric material were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. Overall, two complementary 2&#215;C2&#8208;to&#8208;C4 and (2&#215;C2+C&#8217;2)&#215;n assembly schemes were developed using Pt and Pd catalysis.

Furthermore, high-energy polymeric substances were derived by marrying the molecular intricacy between (&lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;)-1,4-diiodobuta-1,3-diene and calcium carbide, underpinning a unique C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assembly blueprint. The structure and morphology of the polymeric material were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Overall, two complementary 2&#215;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and (2&#215;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+C&#8217;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#215;n assembly schemes were developed using Pt and Pd catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals Promoted Selective Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides and Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono and dichloro&#8208;substituted organic molecules are shown to possess significant roles in various fields, especially in medicinal chemistry. One approach to synthesizing these compounds involves the selective dechlorination of easily prepared trichloromethyl compounds. Nevertheless, developing a practical approach that allows selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination is a challenging task. Herein, we introduced a method for selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates which was promoted by two different Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals. Accordingly, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;borane enabled mono&#8208;substitution of chlorine atom by hydrogen while dihydro&#8208;substitution of chlorine atoms was promoted by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical. Using deuterated Lewis base&#8208;borane as deuterium atom source, mono&#8208; and dideuterodechlorination were also successfully took place. This protocol features broad substrate scope and operates under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Meta&#8208;Ortho Effect on the Excited State Pathways of Chloroanilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the different rates at which the excited isomeric chloroanilines can reach their respective conical intersections for non&#8208;radiative decay. The isomers of the prefulvenic conical intersections are presented as light&#8208;fuelled hovering vehicles traversing the potential energy surface landscape scattered with steep mountains and deep valleys. Cover design by S. Crespi. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Crespi et&#8197;al.

         <title>Two Synthesis Approaches of the 2H&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine Ring System of Alchivemycins A and B</title>

         <dc:description>The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring, a rare structural motif embedded in the molecular architecture of alchivemycins, is synthesized from 2,2,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxin&#8208;4&#8208;one via two routes. Both routes involve the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group to form the TDO ring as a key step. The first synthesis was achieved in 29% overall yield from the starting material by a four&#8208;step sequence featuring a DMAP&#8208;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction to install an acyl group at the C5 position of the TDO ring. The second synthesis was completed in 8% overall yield from the same starting material as the first one through five steps by exploiting a photo&#8208;induced double bromination reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene Carbonate as Latent Formylmethyl Surrogate: The Expediency of Ruthenium(II) Catalysis in Accessing Arylacetaldehydes, Arylacetates and Acetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylacetaldehydes and its corresponding esters are fundamental structural motifs widespread in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Herein, we developed a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed direct formylmethylation and sequential dehydrogenative esterification of phthalazinones by adopting vinylene carbonate as a C2 synthon (formylmethyl equivalent). The reaction is compatible with a repertoire of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. Strikingly, the products obtained are governed by the additive used. A number of control experiments are conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, an important highlight is confirmation of possible intermediates by mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Heterogeneous Dirhodium(II) Catalyst for Nitrene and Carbene Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bimetallic rhodium(II) paddlewheel (Rh2A4) complex is one of the most reactive classes of rhodium catalysts, well&#8208;renowned for the most demanding carbene&#8208; and nitrene&#8208;transfer reactions. In view of its importance in modern synthetic chemistry, we herein report a facile approach for preparing a self&#8208;supported and reusable dirhodium(II) polymer&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst through a reductive ligation protocol. The catalyst displays good reactivity for inter&#8208; and intramolecular nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;insertions of various olefins, and can also engage in C&#8211;H insertion of hydrocarbon derivatives, all under ambient conditions. The catalyst reusability is expected to empower the use of these precious metal catalysts at industrial scales.</dc:description>

The catalyst displays good reactivity for inter- and intramolecular nitrene- and carbene-insertions of various olefins, and can also engage in C&#8211;H insertion of hydrocarbon derivatives, all under ambient conditions. The catalyst reusability is expected to empower the use of these precious metal catalysts at industrial scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Outer Membrane Vesicles Bearing Tn Antigen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;thio glycolipids (TGL) are suggested as key components for producing synthetic outer membrane vesicles (S&#8208;OMVs). Using thiol&#8208;ene coupling (TEC) a small library of TGLs was synthesized with good yields. By combining them with POPC, varying&#8208;sized multilamellar giant vesicles (GVs) were formed, advancing the development of anticancer vaccines and drug delivery systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;thio glycolipids (TGL) are proposed as fundamental components in the production of synthetic outer membrane vesicles (S&#8208;OMVs). A small but representative library of glycolipids was prepared by thiol&#8208;ene coupling (TEC), using unprotected thiols in acceptable to good yields (63&#8208;96&#8201;%). Multilamellar giant vesicles (GVs) of varying sizes were assembled from mixtures of TGL and 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;oleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (POPC). Our results mark an important advancement for the development of synthetic anticancer vaccines, supramolecular adjuvants and drug delivery systems based on glycolipid/phospholipid formulations (10&#8201;% mol/mol in 0.1&#8197;mm solution).

         <title>Photoisomerization of Alkenes via Energy Transfer Enabled by Cu&#8208;Acetylide Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper acetylide complexes were found to act as visible photosensitizers for energy transfer to alkenes. On this basis, the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization reactions of alkenes with various functional groups under blue light irradiation were performed with moderate to high selectivity. The mechanistic studies suggested that the reactions involved energy transfer (EnT) from the photo&#8208;excited copper acetylide to the alkene via the singlet excited state.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the isomerization of alkenes enabled by copper&#8208;acetylide complexes under blue light. This system is applicable to the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted cinnamate derivatives with moderate to excellent Z/E ratios. A reaction pathway involving singlet energy transfer (EnT) from the copper&#8208;acetylide complex to the alkene is proposed.

Abstract
We report the synthesis of cross&#8208;linked pseudopeptides through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction involves the coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid iodides with &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters via in&#8197;situ CO insertion to give pseudopeptides linked by the side chain of the electrophilic counterpart. The key features are the use of a sustainable in&#8197;situ CO surrogate, simple non&#8208;inert conditions, short reaction time, and broad substrate scope. Both amino acids and peptide iodides were utilized as coupling partners.

         <title>Thiuram Disulfides for the Fast and Efficient Synthesis of Peptide Disulfide Bonds Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide disulfide bonds were successfully synthesized by disulfiram and thiram oxidation reactions. Moreover, one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of two disulfide bonds was achieved by the combination of disulfiram or thiram with trans&#8208;[PtBr2(CN)4]2&#8722; under aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds play a critical role in the pharmaceutical and biological properties of peptides. In this work, disulfiram and thiram were investigated to synthesize disulfide bonds in peptides. Excellent purities of single disulfide bond&#8208;containing peptides were achieved with a fast reaction rate. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of two disulfide bonds was successfully achieved by the combination of disulfiram or thiram with trans&#8208;[PtBr2(CN)4]2&#8722; under aqueous conditions.

This works describes a new, straightforward, highly efficient, and mild catalytic protocol for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary propargylamines, via the multicomponent KA2 reaction (Ketone&#8208;Amine&#8208;Alkyne), employing well&#8208;defined, sustainable copper(I) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands.







Abstract
A new, straightforward, highly efficient, and mild catalytic protocol for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary propargylamines, via the multicomponent KA2 reaction (Ketone&#8208;Amine&#8208;Alkyne), employing well&#8208;defined, sustainable copper(I) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands, is reported herein. The methodology uses very low catalyst loading under moderate heating to achieve the construction of a wide range of propargylamines in good to excellent yields in very short reaction times. Challenging substrates, including acyclic linear ketones, aromatic ketones, and electron&#8208;poor aromatic alkynes, as well as substrates bearing synthetically valuable functionalities, are well tolerated.

         <title>Methanol as a C1 Source for the Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Polyheterocyclic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and low&#8208;cost procedure for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;polyheterocyclic systems was reported, starting from the easily accessible aminoalcohols or diaminoalkanes, using CuCl2 as catalyst, H2O2, as inexpensive oxidant agent, and methanol acting both as solvent and reagent, proceeding under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A very attractive approach toward 1,3&#8208;polyheterocyclic systems was provided exploiting the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of aminoalcohols and diaminoalkanes, in oxidative conditions and in the presence of methanol. The synthetic pathway showed the involvement of methanol both as solvent and as a reagent, making the procedure particularly efficient and sustainable for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered polyheterocyclic rings.

         <title>Utilizing Baylis&#8211;Hillman Adducts Followed by Michael Addition/Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Unusual Conformationally Stable Molecules Governed by Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using Baylis&#8208;Hillman (B&#8211;H) and Michael addition processes, the compounds under study have independently sought a novel path for their synthesis. Through a repetition reaction including many different nucleophiles, the veracity of the end result generation was examined. The additional stability of the product via aromatic &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions may be the cause of the unexpected product formation in numerous reactions carried out with varied starting materials. This study comes to the conclusion that weak contacts play an important role in molding the final product as well as supplying selectivity during reactions.

The compounds under investigation sought a new approach to synthesis via the Baylis&#8208;Hillman (B&#8722;H) and Michael addition reactions.

The additional stability of the product via aromatic &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions may result in unexpected product formation in diverse reactions undertaken utilizing different starting materials. This study suggests that weak interaction not only provides selectivity during reactions but also modifies the result.

         <title>Hydroxynitrile Lyase Discovery, Engineering, and Promiscuity towards Asymmetric Synthesis: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the developments made on different aspects of hydroxynitrile lyases such as new discoveries, immobilization, engineering, and catalytic promiscuity since 2016, with respect to their application in asymmetric synthesis. It summarizes the synthetic potential of the selected hydroxynitrile lyases in biocatalytic stereoselective synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrins, &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, their substrate scope and enantioselectivity. The catalytic ability of certain HNLs and their mutants toward new and promiscuous transformations are also described.







Abstract
Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) primarily catalyze the stereoselective synthesis of cyanohydrins, but some of them also carry out asymmetric nitroaldol synthesis (Henry reaction). By virtue of the importance of asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation, and the wide application of chiral cyanohydrins and &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, HNLs have gained significance in organic synthesis. Over the years new HNLs have been discovered and their synthetic scope are evaluated. Engineering of HNLs has contributed towards increasing not only the catalytic toolbox but also broad substrate selectivity, stereoselectivity, enzyme stability, and application of the enzymes for different transformations other than the conventional ones. This review describes the recent discoveries of diverse hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) and the developments to date since 2016, with respect to their biocatalytic applications in the asymmetric synthesis using both natural and promiscuous reactions.

         <title>Radical Acylation of Alkenes by NHC&#8208;Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 48, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis through radical relay were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed radical&#8208;radical reactions have been proven to be powerful strategies for assembling ketyl&#8208;containing compounds via single electron transfer (SET) pathway under either thermal conditions or photoredox conditions. In this context, acylation of alkenes via radical relay under NHC&#8208;organocatalysis has also opened a new window for the difunctionalization of alkenes to construct valuable molecules in organic synthesis. In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems. Conclusions and perspectives were also put forward at the end.

&lt;p&gt;In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC-organocatalysis through radical relay were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC-bound ketyl-type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed radical-radical reactions have been proven to be powerful strategies for assembling ketyl-containing compounds via single electron transfer (SET) pathway under either thermal conditions or photoredox conditions. In this context, acylation of alkenes via radical relay under NHC-organocatalysis has also opened a new window for the difunctionalization of alkenes to construct valuable molecules in organic synthesis. In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC-organocatalysis were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC-bound ketyl-type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems. Conclusions and perspectives were also put forward at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of fused dihydro&#8208; isoquinoline frameworks through a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond annulation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[e] [1,2,4]thiadiazine&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides with vinylene carbonates.







Abstract
A novel method has been developed for the synthesis of fused dihydroisoquinoline frameworks through a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[e][1,2,4]thiadiazine&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides with vinylene carbonates by C&#8722;H bond activation. This is the first report on the oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[e][1,2,4]thiadiazine&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide with vinylene carbonate to afford angularly fused heterocycles in good yields with high functional group tolerance. In this approach, vinylene carbonate acts as a glycolaldehyde surrogate to construct the fused dihydroisoquinoline ring systems.

         <title>Single Step Upgradation of Isatin to Bioactive Fused Heterocycles via Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphical abstract shown here describes the ring expansion reactions of isatin. The 5&#8208;membered ring of isatin is cleaved in different ways to afford a wide variety of heterocyclic organic compounds such as quinolines, spirocyclic derivatives of quinolines, quinazolinones, acridinones and acridines.







Abstract
Isatin, also known as indoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione, is a fused, N&#8208;heterocyclic aromatic compound first isolated and purified in 1841. Since then, isatin and its derivatives emerged as a hot research topic for the scientific community. The number of research publications on isatin justifies their popularity. Researchers explored isatins and their derivatives as potential candidates in multidisciplinary research areas, including medicinal chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and polymer science. Synthetic chemists&#8217; perspective of tailoring isatin and its family members led to more efficient synthesis strategies in which ring&#8208;opening reactions of isatins were particularly significant due to the product's importance. Our investigation aims to group the different types of cascade ring expansion reactions of isatin to synthesise fused heterocyclic compounds such as derivatives of quinolines, quinazolinones, acridines, acridones, and few spiro heterocyclic compounds, all of which highlight an inevitable role in the field of medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Highly Versatile Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines and Characterization of Their Photoluminescent Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we show a robust and versatile procedure for the synthesis of substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines and examine the influence of this substituents on the photophysical properties of this system.







Abstract
In this work, we describe a simple and robust synthetic approach for the formation of 1,3&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines. This was achieved by developing a mild and selective bromination with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) in 3&#8208;position of the imidazole ring. This was followed by a Negishi coupling, which we performed with various coupling partners, resulting in a wide range of different combinations, usually unattainable by other approaches and similar coupling reactions. Fluorescence measurements identified beneficial substitution patterns for the future use of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines in optical applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Green Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkylidenefuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclocarbonylation of Aryl Iodides with Benzyl Acetylenes in 2&#8208;MeTHF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, efficient and practical method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkylidenefuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed from readily accessible aryl iodides and benzyl acetylenes via a recyclable palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative coupling reaction in a green solvent 2&#8208;MeTHF. The reaction proceeds smoothly under a CO atmosphere and mild conditions, yielding a wide range of furanones in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
A novel, highly efficient heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cyclization of aryl iodides and benzyl acetylenes has been developed under an atmospheric pressure of CO. The reaction proceeds smoothly in a bioderived solvent 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) at 50&#8201;&#176;C using an MCM&#8208;41&#8208;anchored bidentate phosphine palladium complex [Pd(OAc)2&#8208;MCM&#8208;41&#8208;P,P] as catalyst with DiPEA as base, delivering a wide variety of 3&#8208;alkylidenefuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones in good to excellent yields. The Pd(OAc)2&#8208;MCM&#8208;41&#8208;P,P complex can be easily recovered by a simple centrifugation and recycled more than ten times without any remarkable loss of catalytic activity. The present method not only avoids the use of toxic solvents such as benzene, toluene and THF, but also addresses the key problem of expensive palladium catalyst recovery and recycle, thus preventing palladium contamination in the final product.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Thiazolo[4,5&#8208;b]indoles via Ring Switch/Cyclization Sequences</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open and shut!!: Unprecedented modular synthesis of thiazolo[4.5&#8208;b]indoles was accomplished by a unique ring switch/cyclization sequences of hemiaminals.







Abstract
The unexpected reactions of indoline hemiaminals affords 2,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxythiazolines through a thioamidation/ring switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a thioamide as a thiazoline precursor under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance (17 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield). Further transformations of the thiazolines provide a direct entry to dihydrothiazolo[4,5&#8208;b]indoles and thiazolo[4,5&#8208;b]indoles.

         <title>Accessing Functionalized Tetrazines as Click Chemistry Tools: A Synthesis Guide for Chemists and Chemical Biologists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazines have emerged as one of the most important bioorthogonal reagents for use in chemical biology and materials chemistry. Despite the importance of tetrazines, their routine synthesis can pose challenges. Recent advancements, and largely overlooked transformations, help overcome these hurdles and allow access to a broad variety of tetrazine scaffolds with applications in inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and beyond.







Abstract
Since the first report that 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines undergo a bioorthogonal reaction with dienophiles in the form of an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, the demand for high&#8208;yielding synthetic approaches towards them grew steadily. Despite this significant interest, tetrazines were predominantly accessed via the Pinner synthesis or other Pinner&#8208;like reactions, significantly limiting available substrates. In particular, the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted s&#8208;tetrazines for the selective conjugation to another species presented a major challenge. To tackle these challenges, new and innovative high&#8208;yielding transformations have been developed to widen the scope of accessible symmetric and unsymmetric tetrazines. For instance, Ni(II), Zn(II), and sulphur&#8208;catalysed reactions between two nitriles and hydrazine were developed, which provide access to a wide range of (un&#8208;)symmetric aryl s&#8208;tetrazines. Also, amidines and orthoesters give tetrazines with alkyl substituents, whereas the usage of CH2Cl2 yields valuable H&#8208;monosubstituted tetrazines. Methods using thiocarbohydrazides, terminal fluoroolefins, oxetane esters, or tosyl hydrazones are among the recent additions. Due to the high interest in tetrazine click&#8208;chemistry approaches, some of which reach beyond inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, we expect this overview of synthetic routes to aid the exploration for further applications of tetrazines. Ultimately, we hope to provide a guide for chemists and chemical biologists for accessing functional s&#8208;tetrazines.

         <title>On the Carbenic Nature of Nitrile Ylides: Experimental and Computational Characterization of Hydroxy and Amino Nitrile Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile ylides with OH and NH2 electron&#8208;donor substituents at C3 were generated and isolated in cryomatrices. Their IR spectral characterization, supported by computed geometries together with NBO and NRT electronic structure analyses, reveal a considerable carbenic character.







Abstract
Nitrile ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar species with structures that are commonly described by propargylic and/or allenic resonance forms. Nevertheless, certain nitrile ylides exhibit a tendency to form dimers, suggesting the existence of structures characterized by an important carbenic contribution. To address the nitrile ylide carbenic nature, here we investigate two derivatives with OH and NH2 electron&#8208;donating substituents. These nitrile ylides were generated in cryogenic matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;isoxazole precursors and were found to photoisomerize to the corresponding oxazoles. The IR spectral characterization of the photogenerated nitrile ylides reveals the absence of the characteristic strong &#957;as(CNC) absorption, which is associated with allenic and propargylic type structures. Computed geometries for the two experimentally investigated nitrile ylides and for analogues with different substituents at C3 and C1, together with NBO and NRT electronic structure analyses, performed at the CCSD(T) level of theory, reveal substantial carbenic character exclusively for nitrile ylides bearing OH and NH2 substituents at C3. As a whole, the results shed light on the factors determining the structural features of nitrile ylides, which play a major role in defining the reactivity of these important elusive compounds.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds has gained significant attention due to their broad utility in various research areas. In this Concept, we reviewed the burgeoning transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations involving pentavalent phosphoryl precursors. Emphasizing direct C&#8722;P bond formation, we illuminate recent advances, challenges, and forthcoming avenues, offering a succinct yet comprehensive exploration of this vibrant research field.







Abstract
The synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds has gained considerable attention due to their wide applications across many research fields. Among the available strategies, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformation of pentavalent phosphoryl (H&#8722;P(O)) precursors is particularly appealing. This approach involves a direct C&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming process, rendering it straightforward, and it employs readily available, bench&#8208;stable H&#8722;P(O) reagents that are compatible with various metal catalysts. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in this field, with a primary focus on asymmetric C&#8722;P cross&#8208;couplings and hydrophosphorylations. This Concept article provides a brief summary of recent progress, highlights existing challenges, and discusses future directions in this exciting area.

The three&#8208;component &#8220;CN&#8208;free&#8221; reactions of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl ketones, aryl azides and aqueous ammonia for the synthesis of fully substituted 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles has been disclosed.







Abstract
A new method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is developed using a three&#8208;component strategy. The cyano group is generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl ketone and aqueous ammonia. The one&#8208;pot protocol allows the synthesis of 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Stepwise Aerobic Oxidation/N&#8208;Arylation from Benzothiazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;arylbenzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one compounds was achieved by Cu&#8208;catalyzed the oxidization of substituted benzothiazoles and N&#8208;arylation of benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one with arylboronic acids.







Abstract
We report herein an efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;arylbenzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one compounds. First, substituted benzothiazoles can be smoothly oxidized to benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives in the presence of CuCl2 and trifluoroacetic anhydride. Secondly, the Cu2S&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one with arylboronic acids yields a series of novel 3&#8208;aryl benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The method provides good yields for a variety of substrates and shows good compatibility with functional groups. The usefulness of the skeleton was further illustrated by the derivatization of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one. Mechanistic studies suggest that the oxidation of benzothiazole may undergo a free radical reaction process.

         <dc:description>Our gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes allowed us to prepare a variety of 1&#8208;bromocyclopentene derivatives. These have been used as substrates in a 3&#8208;step synthetic sequence comprising a cross&#8208;coupling reaction, followed by ozonolysis, and final condensation towards the corresponding 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridine. In addition, bicyclic fused pyridines are achieved, including the first total synthesis of the natural product Sinensine B.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to secondary amines via the hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer reaction mediated by KOtBu</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have unveiled here an N&#8208;alkylation reaction of amines by alcohols via hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer. Unlike other catalytic systems containing transition metals or additives, potassium tertiary butoxide was found to be a unique and effective catalyst for synthesizing secondary amines. The role of the K+ ion and the reaction intermediates were studied under control experiments and by theoretical calculations. The reaction was found to be general and tolerates a series of functional groups providing a convenient method to synthesize N&#8208;alkylated compounds.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;regioselective unactivated C(sp3 )&#8722;H of free alcohols dehydrogenative coupling with quinazolines for the synthesis of &#948;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl substituted quinazolines in aqueous media has been developed. Various alcohols including 1&#176; and 2&#176; alcohols, reacted with quinazolines through 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer strategies to give the corresponding 2&#8208; or 4&#8208; &#948;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl substituted quinazolines with good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Notably, several substituted quinazolines and quinazolinones could be selectively dehydrogenative&#8208;coupled with divergent free alcohols. This protocol provides a platform to access divergent functionalizations of quinazolines and quinazolinones to meet the growing needs for screening.

         <title>Synthesis of Perfluoro Alkyl/Alkenyl Aryl Sulfide: C&#8722;S Coupling Reaction Using Hexafluoropropylene Dimer (HFPD) as a Building Block</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoropropylene dimer (HFPD) was directly employed to synthesize perfluoro alkyl/alkenyl aryl sulfides. A variety of thiophenol substrates were conveniently chlorinated by N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS); afterwards, C6 perfluoroalkyl was introduced in the presence of cesium fluoride (Path&#8197;A). Moreover, the C6 perfluoroalkenyl was directly constructed by inorganic base&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic substitution (Path&#8197;B).







Abstract
Efficient approaches to perfluoroalkyl/alkenyl aryl sulfides were accomplished by a C&#8722;S coupling reaction under mild conditions. Hexafluoropropylene dimer was employed as a versatile building block for the perfluoroalkylation and perfluoroalkenylation of thiophenol. The application of the synthetic strategy was demonstrated by the high&#8208;yield transformation of a broad range of aryl derivatives. A plausible mechanistic explanation was proposed to elaborate the differences between the two reaction pathways. The methodology provides straightforward and convenient access to aryl sulfides constituting C6 perfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkenyl substituents.

         <title>Study of the Mechanism of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclizations of Aryl, Vinyl, and Alkyl Radicals on Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we conducted a study of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations mechanism involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals on oxime ethers. Initially, the reaction of brominated oxime ether 9a with (TMS)3SiH and AIBN gave rise to aryl radicals that underwent a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization on the oxime ether, yielding dibenzoxepine 10a, and the ipso reaction and reduction products were obtained as well. Approximate rate constants at 80 &#176;C for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig (1.0 x 108 s&#8722;1) and the ipso cyclization (4.3 x 107 s&#8722;1) were determined by competition experiments. DFT calculations showed good agreement with the experimental results. The reduction rate constant of the N&#8208;alkoxyaminyl radical with (TMS)3SiH was calculated to be 4.1 x 10&#8722;1 M&#8722;1s&#8722;1; while the rate constants for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations of vinyl and alkyl radicals on the oxime ether were estimated in the ranges of 106 s&#8722;1 &#8208; 108 s&#8722;1 and 103 s&#8722;1 &#8208; 108 s&#8722;1, respectively. The 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization reactions involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals with oxime ethers were found to be an exothermic and irreversible process, with the oximic carbon showing a preference for nucleophilic alkyl radicals. This kinetic study contributes to the deeper understanding of radical&#8208;mediated cyclizations, enabling the efficient design of complex synthetic routes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles display bioactivities like antidepressant, antifungal activity, antitumor, etc. Numerous approaches have been established to form sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. 4&#8208;Sulfanyl&#8208; and 5&#8208; sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were produced by metal&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), etc. N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were generated via the reaction of acetylides with sulfonyl azides, CuAAC. 4&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were produced through [3+2] cycloaddition and reaction of azide with bromovinylsulfonyl fluoride. Although 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were formed successfully via RuAAC, their synthetic approaches were very limited. 1&#8208;Phosphinyl&#8208;2&#8208;sulfanylethynes were suitable substances to access sulfur&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;containing triazoles.

         <title>Hybrid Steroid&#8208;[60]Fullerene as n&#8208;Type Material for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new steroid&#8208;[60]fullerene hybrid obtained through a cyclopropanation reaction has been synthesized and its optoelectronic properties compared with PC61BM as reference acceptor material in organic solar cells. The structure of monoadducts were fully determined and, amazingly, theoretical calculations, together with the experimental results obtained, demonstrate that the new compound can be considered an appealing candidate for photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
Fullerene derivatives have been used as electron acceptor and transport materials in organic photovoltaics as well as in perovskite solar cells. Among them, [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been one of the most widely used, in combination with poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (P3HT) as an electron donor semiconducting polymer, for the fabrication of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSC). In this work, a steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid was synthesized through the Bingel&#8211;Hirsch reaction to compare its properties with PC61BM as the reference structure. Different spectroscopic techniques were employed to characterize the new fullerene derivative, namely 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and cyclic voltammetry were also performed. The characterization was completed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which explore the hybrid&#8216;s morphology, where the presence of the steroid moiety increases the solubility of the fullerene material. DFT/PBE&#8722;D3(BJ)/6&#8208;311G(d,p) calculations for both the steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid and PC61BM allowed to obtain geometry optimizations and electronic structure data. A comparative study to analyze the nature of the electronic properties of the synthesized steroid&#8208;[60]fullerene hybrid and PC61BM with an oligomer of ten thiophene units, used in the active layer of organic solar cells, was carried out. Electron density maps using the [CIS|CNDOL/21] approach illustrate the photoexcitation of the donor followed by an electron&#8208;charge transfer to the acceptor fullerene.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Bromination of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds with Bromoform</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced bromination of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds by using bromoform as bromine source was developed, providing a green synthetic route to &#945;&#8208;bromoesters. This protocol features no use of a photocatalyst or an additive, and a broad substrate scope. Its practicality was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale reaction and several valuable follow&#8208;up transformations.







Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for bromination of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds is achieved for the construction of &#945;&#8208;bromoesters with bromoform. It is noteworthy that the reaction occurs under sole light irradiation without a photocatalyst or an additive. Several synthetic transformations and gram&#8208;scale reactions demonstrate the synthetic potential of this photochemical reaction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Heck Type Regioselective &#946;&#8208;Vinylation of Thiophenes Using a Bromo Substituent as Traceless Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;migration associated to Heck vinylation provides a new tool in traceless C&#8722;H bond functionalization at &#946;&#8208;position of thiophenes.







Abstract
Functionalization of &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of thiophenes such as their vinylation is more challenging than for their &#945;&#8208;positions. The use of Pd&#8208;catalysis allowed us to vinylate such thienyl &#946;&#8208;positions. Oxidative addition of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)thiophenes to palladium followed by a Pd 1,4&#8208;migration activates these thienyl &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H positions, then, classical Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction gives the &#946;&#8208;vinylated 2&#8208;arylthiophene derivatives. In the course of this coupling reaction, the bromide substituent on the aryl unit acts as a traceless directing group. It should also be mentioned that the created C&#8722;C bond results from the functionalization of two C&#8722;H bonds. This synthesis scheme tolerates a range of substituents on both the aryl ring and the alkene. In addition, this procedure employs an easily available air&#8208;stable catalyst and an inexpensive base. This reaction allows the programmed Pd&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted thiophenes using first Suzuki C2&#8208;coupling, then Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct C5&#8208;arylation and finally Pd 1,4&#8208;migration Heck C3&#8208;vinylation.

Abstract
The combination of I2/CAN has emerged as a mild and powerful reagent for the oxidative Csp3&#8208;Csp2 cleavage of 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;7&#8208;azaindolylmethane to provide a quantitative combined yield of 3&#8208;formyl and 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole in a one&#8208;pot reaction at RT. A plausible mechanism and characterization, including XRD, has been described. The synthetic transformations of title compounds were explored by reduction, Click, reductive amination, and Suzuki coupling reaction.

         <title>Mechanism of Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Oligomerization of Arylallenes and Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed mechanisms of Piers&#8217; borane&#8208;induced oligomerization of unsaturated arylallene and arylacetylene through unique boryl&#8208;enabled steps including hydroboration, 1,3&#8208;boryl&#8208;shift, allylboration, carboboration, 1,5&#8208;electrocyclization, and multistep rearrangement, followed by catalytic turnover through transborylation with stable pinacolborane are disclosed by extensive dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations, paving the avenue to boryl&#8208;enabled catalytic synthesis.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that Piers&#8217; borane [HB(C6F5)2]2 can induce rapid oligomerization reactions of arylacetylenes and arylallenes. Using phenylallene PhCH=C=CH2 and phenylacetylene PhCCH as typical substrates, the detailed mechanisms of borane&#8208;induced oligomerization are disclosed by extensive state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations. Following initial regioselective hydroboration of unsaturated C=C or C&#8801;C bonds, further oligomerization and structural rearrangement reactions may occur through unique boryl&#8208;enabled conversions such as 1,3&#8208;boryl&#8208;shift, allylboration, 1,2&#8208;carboboration, and 1,5&#8208;electrocyclization. Together with stepwise transborylation with hydroboranes such as pinacolborane HBpin, such fundamental reactions may pave a catalytic way to borane&#8208;induced oligomerization of arylacetylenes and arylallenes.

         <title>Directed C&#8722;H Allylation of Aromatic Carboxamides with Allyl Aryl Ethers under Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allyl aryl ethers have proved to be efficient allylating agents for (hetero)arenes under Cp*Co(III) catalysis using an amide as directing group. DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic course and reactivity pattern.







Abstract
The Cp*Co(III) C&#8722;H allylation of (hetero)arenes with allyl aryl ethers has been developed using an amide as directing group (24 examples). DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic course and reactivity pattern, showing that strong electron releasing groups favour the reaction by reducing the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H activation step. However, the steric strain can increase the energy of the migratory insertion step to the point of completely preventing the reaction, as in the case of the 3,5&#8208;dimethylbenzamide. The obtained allylated compounds have been transformed into a variety of interesting heterocyclic and carbocyclic structures, such as isoquinolones and isochromanones.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition of Bulky Aryl Substituents to Pentacene&#8208;6,13&#8208;quinone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the introduction of bulky aryl substituents of the biphenyl, terphenyl, and quaterphenyl type at the 6,13 and 5,7,12,14 positions of the pentacene scaffold by reaction of the corresponding quinones with lithium organic reagents. The 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituent could be installed at the 5,7,12,14&#8208;positions and regioselectively either at 6,13 or at the 5,13 positions. The dissymmetric substitution motif results from concomitant 1,2 and rare 1,4&#8208;addition to 6,13&#8208;pentacenequinone. A one&#8208;pot protocol leads to isomeric symmetric 6,13&#8208;disubstituted pentacenes and allows installation of two 5'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;[1,1':3',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituents. The four new pentacenes differ in crystal packing and photochemical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentially Protected Glycols from &#945;&#8208;Halo Boronic Esters and Lithiated Benzoates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of spartein derived carbanions as chiral d1&#8208;reagents with Matteson&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;bromo boronic esters as chiral a1&#8208;reagents was explored. Good yields and d.r. values were obtained for &#945;&#8208;bromo boronic esters with sufficient steric bulk in the &#946;&#8208;position, which opens up opportunities for downstream applications in syntheses based on iterative Matteson&#8208;Reactions.







Abstract
In the presence of sparteine 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoates were lithiated enantioselectively in order to generate chiral d1 reagents. Their reaction with &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters, resembling chiral a1 reagents, was explored. Enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters are readily available by Matteson Homologation (MH). A model reaction with &#945;&#8208;bromopentyl pinandiol boronate was optimized to an acceptable yield but proved to be quite sensitive. Generation of the d1 reagent from the corresponding stannane stabilized the protocol and delivered moderate yields for &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters. Good to excellent yields were obtained for &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters, which can be generated by iterative MH, thus establishing this method as a useful terminus for an iterative Matteson sequence.

         <title>Catalytic Hydrolithiation of Guaiazulene: Isolation of Two Isomerically Pure Renewable Feedstock&#8208;Based Cyclopentadienyl Synthons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective hydride (LiH) addition via an unprecedented catalytic olefin hydrolithiation and proton abstraction at guaiazulene is documented in full detail, including isolation of analytically and isomerically pure samples, their NMR and XRD structural characterization. Both cyclopentadienyl type carbanions will allow to substitute petrochemical&#8208;based by renewable resources&#8208;based organometallic chemistry in future.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth study of hydride transfer or proton abstraction at natural product guaiazulene to form guaiazulenide salts (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li 1&#8201;a and (Gua&#8217;&#8217;)Na(OEt2) 2. Both carbanions were correctly proposed by Hafner et&#8197;al. but could never be isolated in isomerically, spectroscopically and analytically pure form so far. Therefore, their use as cyclopentadienyl synthons in organometallic chemistry remained essentially unexplored. Here, we present their synthesis and full characterisation including 2D NMR spectroscopy and two XRD structural analyses. 1&#8201;a is isolated in isomerically and chemically pure form via a catalytic variant of olefin hydrolithiation, the addition of LiH to an activated hydrocarbon C=C double bond catalysed by LiAlH4. This atom economic synthesis of a pure organolithium compound from an olefin, LiH or lithium and dihydrogen, respectively, is without precedence. In a follow up report we will demonstrate that these valuable ligand salts can be used as cheap sterically demanding renewable feedstock&#8208;based cyclopentadienyl synthons in the synthesis of homo&#8208; and heteroleptic late transition metal complexes and catalysts.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the extensions of the Evans asymmetric methodology are summarized from seven aspects.

Although the asymmetric catalysis has made a spurt of progress, the use of chiral auxiliaries remains crucial in asymmetric synthesis due to both the reliability and versatility of the methods, and the predictability of stereochemistry of the reactions. Up to date, Evans&#8217; chiral non&#8208;racemic oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric synthetic methodology is still widely used in asymmetric synthesis. More importantly, the Evans asymmetric synthetic methodology turned out to be a fruitful source of inspiration for the development of related asymmetric synthetic methodologies. However, although reviews on the application of Evans&#8217; asymmetric synthetic methodology in both organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry continually to appear in the literature, a comprehensive review dedicating to the extensions of Evans&#8217; chiral non&#8208;racemic oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric methodology remains elusive. In this review, we summarize the extensions of the Evans asymmetric methodology, which cover: (1) the modification of the chiral oxazolidinone auxiliaries; (2) the extension of the Evans&#8217; asymmetric aldol reaction from Evans&#8217; syn&#8208;aldol to other diastereomeric aldol adducts; (3) the extension of the asymmetric reaction types; (4) the extension of chiral imide&#8208;type substrates to N&#8208;alkenyl, N&#8208;allenenyl and N&#8208;alkynyl oxazolidinones; (5) the achiral oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis; (6) the catalytic transformation of Evans&#8217; products; and (7) the straightforward transformations of Evans&#8217; chiral products to other classes of compounds than the chiral carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, and Weinreb amides.

This work reports an effective semi&#8208;synthetic strategy for the synthesis of a new class of potentially bioactive triazole&#8208;bearing alkenylated benzosuberene analogues from himachalenes, extracted from Cedrus deodara oil.







Abstract
Herein, we have reported an effective semi&#8208;synthetic strategy for the synthesis of a new class of triazole&#8208;bearing alkenylated benzosuberene analogues from himachalenes, extracted from Cedrus deodara oil. A highly efficient 1,2,3&#8208;triazole triggered Heck cross&#8208;coupling has been developed under palladium catalyzed conditions. The 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety helps significantly to activate the carbon&#8208;halogen bond and thereby promotes the coupling product. The developed protocol endures an array of arylated as well as alkylated triazole&#8208;substituted benzocycloheptene to achieve the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Reaction Mechanism and Origin of Stereoselectivity in the Fluorination and Trifluoromethylthiolation of 2&#8208;Bromoamides with AgF and AgSCF3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations and an experimental study of fluorination of 2&#8208;bromoamides with AgF and trifluoromethylthiolation with AgSCF3 were performed in order to elucidate their reaction mechanisms, which provide a robust synthetic method for chiral 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;SCF3 amide compounds.







Abstract
Reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with AgF readily gave the corresponding 2&#8208;fluorinated amide with retention of configuration. The mechanism and origin of the stereochemistry were rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which suggested a double&#8208;inversion pathway via the formation of an aziridinone intermediate. The computed reaction pathway is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the stereochemistry in base&#8208;promoted trifluoromethylthiolation of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides using AgSCF3 was examined. The experimental results showed that the reaction proceeds through the generation of a neutral aziridinone intermediate, following the attack of a trifluoromethylthiolate anion at C&#8208;3. The stereoselectivity of C&#8208;3 attack on the aziridinone depended on the steric bulk of substitutes on the &#945;&#8208;position and nitrogen of the amide. The study results show the potential utility of AgF and AgSCF3 in the synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;functionalized amide derivatives and provide mechanistic insights for nucleophilic substitution of 2&#8208;bromoamides.

However, the complicated structure of steroids, especially their highly oxygenated skeleton, has presented significant challenges. Benefitted from recent advancements in bioinformatics, genetics, and enzyme engineering, chemoenzymatic strategy combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis with the high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity of biocatalysis, being an effective approach for the concise synthesis of natural products.

         <title>Successive&#223;&#8208;Glycosylations of Tiacumicinone: Formal Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B and Access to a D&#8208;Mannoside Analog</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal total synthesis of the natural macrolide antibiotic tiacumicin B is described featuring successive and selective glycosylations of tiacumicinone. The challenging &#946;&#8208;facial selectivity of these key glycosylation steps was achieved by using noviosyl or rhamnosyl donors equipped with a phenyl sulfoxide leaving group and a 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group ensuring an efficient remote stereodirecting effect. Compared with our former total synthesis, this strategy enables us to save steps and gain access to new analogs. This was demonstrated by the replacement of the rhamnosidic moiety by a D&#8208;mannose derivative.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new isoxazole&#8208;substituted aryl iodides 1a&#8208;1d have been synthesized by DIB&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yloxy) benzene (4) with corresponding benzaldehyde oximes 5a&#8208;5d. Structure of the synthesized aryl iodides 1 were characterized by IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and HRMS. The structure of 1a was also confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Further, catalytic activity of iodoarenes 1a&#8208;1d was screened for the oxidation of hydroquinones and sulfides. On oxidation using aryl iodides 1 with m&#8208;CPBA as terminal oxidant, hydroquinones afforded benzoquinones while sulfides gave corresponding sulfoxides in good to excellent yields. Iodoarene 1b showed the best catalytic activity for the oxidation of sulfides and hydroquinones. Moreover, iodoarene 1b, was also utilized for alpha&#8208;oxytosylation of acetophenones.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a promising group of biosurfactants due to their high fermentation yield, self&#8208;assembly and biological activity. During fermentation by&#160;Pseudozyma aphidis, a mixture of MELs with different levels of acylation is formed, of which the fully deacetylated form is the most valuable. In order to reduce the environmental impact of deacetylation, an enzymatic process using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) has been developed. We tested the deacetylation of a purified MELs mixture with immobilized&#160;Candida antarctica&#160;lipase B enzyme and 2&#8208;ethylhexanol as co&#8208;substrate in 140 h reactions with different NADES. We identified hydrophobic NADES systems with similar yields and kinetics as in pure 2&#8208;ethylhexanol solvent. Our results indicate that deacetylation of MELs mixtures in NADES as a solvent is possible with yields comparable to pure co&#8208;substrate and that hydrophobic NADES without carboxylic acid compounds facilitate the reaction to the greatest extent.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Octahydroperylene, the Framework of Altertoxin III</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;configured octahydroperylene core, present in perylenequinone&#8208;derived mycotoxins like altertoxin III was synthesized from anthraflavic acid in four steps.







Abstract
Routes to the framework of perylenequinone&#8208;derived mycotoxins of the dihydroanthracene type are described. Starting with anthracene derivatives, attachment of C3 units at positions 9 and 10 and twofold cyclization would furnish the required pentacycle. Heck&#8208;type couplings, SN2 additions of enolates, alkynyl and allyl additions turned out to be not successful, while addition of a Grignard reagent prepared from acetal&#8208;protected 3&#8208;bromopropionaldehyde to anthraflavic acid methyl ester, subsequent acetal cleavage, and Birch reduction furnished octahydroperylene in only four steps.

         <dc:description>
Based on phosphoryl&#8208;substituted ynones and o&#8208;phenylenediamines and varying reaction conditions (noncatalytic conditions or one&#8208;pot Au&#8208;catalyzed hydration and condensation), efficient methods for divergent synthesis of two different types of heterocyclic compounds &#8208; benzo[b][1,4]diazepin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphonates and (quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methylphosphonates&#8208; have been developed.







Abstract
It is shown that the reaction of conjugated ynones containing a phosphoryl group with o&#8208;phenylenediamines can, depending on the conditions, lead to the selective formation of phosphorylated 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines and quinoxalines. Phosphorylated quinoxalines can be used for synthesis of substituted vinyl quinoxalines.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage and Ring Reconstruction for the Synthesis of Amaryllidaceae Alkaloid Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogues of bioactive tazettine and mesembrine alkaloids were synthesised from a common keto aldehyde intermediate. The key feature of the synthesis was the reconstruction of the ring&#8197;B in several different ways to form structural cores of macronine, pretazettine and tazettine. In addition, the same intermediate was used to prepare an egonine&#8208;like product.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis of analogues of bioactive Amaryllidaceae alkaloids that contain a five&#8208;membered ring&#8197;C and a quaternary carbon centre. The synthesis was carried out in a divergent manner, starting from a common intermediate, keto aldehyde 1&#8201;a. This intermediate was obtained by oxidative cleavage of a carbocyclic ring present in the previously synthesised tetracyclic compounds. Subsequent closure of a new heterocyclic ring&#8197;B using different methods led to products with structural cores found in naturally occurring alkaloids such as pretazettine, tazettine or macronine. In addition, an analogue of egonine was prepared from the same intermediate. Our approach thus provides access to multiple structural types of potentially bioactive molecules.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed annulation of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and internal alkynes for the synthesis of quinoxalines is developed. This method provides a variety of quinoxalines in good to high yields under a simple and mild reaction conditions with molecular O2 as a terminal oxidant. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that a novel reaction mechanism is involved in the current reaction, which is different from the previous reported dicarbonyl compound mechanism via the oxidation of the alkyne.

         <title>Synthesis of the Altertoxin I Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core of the perylenequinone&#8208;derived mycotoxin altertoxin I was synthesized either from 3&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone or from 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, where Suzuki couplings, Ullmann couplings, McMurry olefinations, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts acetylation were key steps in the respective syntheses.







Abstract
Routes to the framework of perylenequinone&#8208;derived mycotoxins of the biphenyl type are described. 1,2,11,12&#8208;Tetrahydroperylenequinone is most suitably prepared in seven steps starting with 3&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone. Key steps are an Ullmann coupling, pinacol&#8208;type cyclization, bromination, enolate reaction, and intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization. A second approach starting with 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene yields the respective decarbonylated core. Key steps of this 5&#8208;step sequence are again an Ullmann coupling and a McMurry olefination. The cleavage of the preferentially utilized hexyl protecting group could be achieved with boron bromide.

A new visible light photoreductive dearomatizative alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts for producing 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines by harnessing N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts both as the alkyl radical precursors to initiate the reaction and as the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;based alkylating reagents to terminate the reaction is developed. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that this reaction proceeds via directly alkyl radical addition across the pyridinium ring followed by single electron oxidant and dearomatization.







Abstract
A visible light photoreductive dearomatizative alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts for producing 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines is described. The reaction harnesses N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts both as the alkyl radical precursors to initiate the reaction and as the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;based alkylating reagents to terminate the reaction. In contrast to the reported electroreductive procedure via the key dihydropyridine radical intermediates, mechanistic studies demonstrate that this photoreductive dearomatizative alkylation proceeds via directly alkyl radical addition across the pyridinium ring followed by single electron oxidant (SEO) and dearomatization.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrically Substituted [5]Helicenes by Tandem Arylation of Binaphthyl by Suzuki Coupling and C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem arylation of binaphthyl diiodide by Suzuki coupling and subsequent C&#8722;H activation affords substituted [5]helicene derivatives. C&#8722;H activation is facilitated by the presence of an ortho&#8208;activating group in the adjacent position. In the case of unsymmetrically substituted boronic acids, the regioselectivity of C&#8722;H activation is controlled by the electronic and steric effects of the substituents.







Abstract
We report a step&#8208;efficient approach for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;g]chrysenes by tandem arylation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diiodo&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl with arylboronic acids, which proceeds through Suzuki coupling followed by intramolecular arylation by C&#8722;H activation. Substrate screening examining over 30 meta&#8208; and/or para&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids showed that this approach provides the desired helicene products most effectively if arylboronic acids have a small acidifying group at the meta&#8208;position. In the case of unsymmetrically substituted arylboronic acids, the regioselectivity of C&#8722;H activation is directed by the attached group(s), its effect on the C&#8722;H acidity of the adjacent position, its coordination ability, as well as steric hindrance. Interestingly, selected [5]helicenes exhibited attractive deep blue emission with fluorescence lifetimes slightly exceeding 10&#8197;ns.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Unnatural Tryptophans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural tryptophans are introduced to explore and engineer the dynamics, function and properties of modified proteins because of intrinsic fluorescence decay, participation in various &#960;&#8208;system interactions, and high occurrences of tryptophan nucleolus in proteins. Due to its role in protein stability and utility as a fluorophore, it becomes a useful unit for protein studies. Several unnatural tryptophans including the oxygen and sulfur analogues have been constructed as endogenous tryptophan analogues to modify the fluorescent character with minimal perturbation to the native structure, while others have been synthesized to probe the cellular mechanisms of protein synthesis. A number of efficient methods for the construction of this important building block, including Larock indolisation, Heck coupling, Negishi coupling and Sonagashira coupling followed by cyclisation have been widely studied and patented as well, by different research groups. Surprisingly, there is a scarcity of any comprehensive reviews on palladium catalyzed synthesis of unnatural tryptophans. Therefore, we summarized the development of different palladium catalysts, ligands and synthetic approaches for the unnatural tryptophans from 2005 to the most recent results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review on the synthesis of unnatural tryptophans.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles&#160;Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease of cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor become more negatively charged whereas the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor becomes more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Bridged Thienonaphthalimides: Synthesis, Characterization and Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three small molecules consisting of thieno&#8208;fused naphthalimide units connected via aromatic linkers were synthesized to study the effect of fused thiophene rings on the properties of naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules. A protocol for the synthesis of thienonaphthalimide&#8208;based molecules without prior preparation and use of thienonaphthalimide precursors and organoelement compounds (organolithium, organotin, or organoboron compounds) was developed. The protocol based on double thienannulation of bis&#8208;alkyne substrates with sodium sulfide. The thin&#8208;film morphology, photophysical and electrochemical properties of the obtained small molecules were studied. Single&#8208;layer non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on fluorene&#8208;bridged thienonaphthalimide dimer showed yellow emission with luminance of 2200 cd/m2, and current efficiency of 0.35 cd/A. Combination of transient electroluminescence and photo&#8208;CELIV methods allowed to estimate electron and hole mobility in the synthesized compounds; both are in order of 10&#8208;6 cm2/V&#8208;1s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An  efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 3&#8208;arylquinazolinones with mono and double alkyne insertion was developed for the synthesis of fused quinazolinone derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Computational Studies towards the Optimization of the Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate: Advantages of Continuous Flow Processing</title>

1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates are conveniently prepared from triazolopyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide precursors, by reacting sulfilimine and a nitrile oxide species. Herein, an efficient and straightforward procedure to prepare [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;N&#8208;oxide in continuous flow is reported. A mechanistic study performed using density functional theory (DFT) provided deep insights on the whole reaction manifold and indication on how to reduce the generation of by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Several strategies to synthesize desired 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate targets have been reported over the years. The most convenient way features the preparation of the precursor triazolopyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide through a condensation step between sulfilimines and a nitrile oxide species, followed by a deoxygenation step. This paper presents a detailed work on the synthesis of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;N&#8208;oxide, featuring a synergistic experimental&#8208;theoretical approach. Herein, we report the development of an efficient and straightforward method to prepare ethyl [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate 3&#8208;oxide in continuous flow. The transfer from batch to flow processing resulted in a significant boost in isolated yield (53&#8201;% vs. 31&#8201;%) and a decrease in the simultaneous presence of starting materials and product in the reaction media from 4&#8197;hours to 3.5&#8197;minutes. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of the reaction using density functional theory provided a deeper understanding of the whole reaction manifold and key indications on how to further improve the process in flow.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Tandem Cyclization Reaction of Unsaturated Sulfoximines with Diselenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem sulfoximido&#8208;selenization of unsaturated sulfoximines with diselenides has been built via electrochemical&#8208;catalyzed process. With nBu4NBr as the role of catalyst and electrolyte, the reaction was carried out with metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free under mild conditions to afford sulfoximidoyl&#8208;based heterocycles.







Abstract
An electrochemically enabled tandem cyclization reaction of unsaturated sulfoximines with diselenides has been well developed, affording metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free access to sulfoximidoyl&#8208;based heterocycles containing selenium in moderate to good yields. With nBu4NBr as the role of catalyst and electrolyte, this methodology shows broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance under mild conditions.

         <title>How to Set the "Chirality" of Polyhedral Small Molecule Hydrocarbons: Decoration and Skeleton Editing of Cubane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small polyhedral hydrocarbons represented by cubane have attracted attention as potential molecular scaffolds for pharmaceuticals as benzene bioisoster. Cubane is also expected to be used as a chiral scaffold, but due to its high symmetry, it is necessary to introduce chirality by sequential site&#8208;selective introduction of substituents. Furthermore, polyhedral desymmetrized isomers of cubane, such as cuneane and semibullvalene, and extended cage compounds, such as bishomocubane and homocuneane, exhibit chirality and are also expected to be used as new optically active scaffolds. In this concept, we would like to explain the synthetic routes we have planned, specifically, the decoration and editing of the cubane skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Ketone Galactose Catalyst for Asymmetric Epoxidation: Experimental and Theoretical Model</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the introduction of the Shi catalyst, the organocatalytic epoxidation of olefins has become an area of continued research interest. To explore the possibility to enhance the efficiency and stability of the catalyst, the synthesis of a galactose&#8208;derived trifluoromethyl ketone, and its use for stereoselective epoxidation reaction that exploits a transitory dioxirane as active species are herein reported. The trifluoromethyl ketone was built on the C6 of a protected D&#8208;galactopyranose. The organocatalyst was obtained smoothly in a few steps, and when utilized for stereoselective epoxidation exhibited excellent stability as no chemical alterations were observed during the reaction. The stereoselectivity, although sometimes moderate, appears surprisingly high considering the conformational freedom of the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety.
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the interactions involved in regulating the observed selectivities. Moreover, a new mnemonic model has been developed to serve as a fast&#8208;predicting tool for epoxidation of new substrates.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the formation of monofluoroallenes through copper&#8208;catalyzed defluoroalkylation or defluoroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes using affordable and readily available Grignard reagents. Additionally, alkyl lithium or alkyl zinc reagents proved successful in these transformations. Under mild conditions, monofluoroallenes can be converted into fluorinated olefinic compounds or non&#8208;fluorinated alkyne compounds. Initial mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction may start with an organocopper reagent and undergo a rapid &#946;&#8208;F elimination step. Although the current enantiomeric excess is low, chiral ligands could facilitate the asymmetric transformation of this reaction.

         <title>Photoinduced Single&#8208;Electron Reduction of Alkenes.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes recent advances in photoinduced single electron reduction of alkenes for alkene difunctionalization by using highly reductive photocatalyst and charge transfer complex (CTC) strategy.







Abstract
Alkenes serve as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. However, the challenge of achieving single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes persists. In recent years, photocatalysis has emerged as a promising and efficient tool for accomplishing the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes. Given the potential benefits that can be derived from photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes, including the development of potent catalytic systems to enable diverse alkene difunctionalization reactions, it is necessary to provide a conceptual understanding of this emerging field. Hence, we present an overview of current synthetic techniques for photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes.

         <title>5&#8208;N,N&#8208;Diarylaminothiazoles with Electron&#8208;Accepting Groups: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and Their Application for the Detection of Hydrazine Hydrate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized 5&#8208;N,N&#8208;diarylaminothiazoles featuring electron&#8208;accepting groups and studied their photophysical properties. Notably, the derivative with a dicyanovinyl group effectively captured hydrazine hydrate. This reaction was confirmed through absorption and emission spectra, and it was even with the naked eye.







Abstract
5&#8208;N,N&#8208;diarylaminothiazoles containing cyano and nitro groups were synthesized using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination reaction with good yields. The cyano group in the resultant thiazole was reduced to a formyl group. This was then subjected to the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, leading to the formation of thiazoles with a dicyanovinyl group. The nitro group in the thiazole was reduced to an amino group, which was subsequently reacted with triphosgene, yielding a thiazole with an isocyanate group. These thiazoles, with their electron&#8208;accepting properties, demonstrated absorption and emission spectra at longer wavelengths. Notably, the thiazole containing the dicyanovinyl group displayed a red emission. Tests for the detection of hydrazine, a hazardous volatile organic compound, were conducted using the synthesized thiazoles. The results showed that the dicyanovinyl group effectively responded to hydrazine hydrate, evidenced by changes in the absorption and emission spectra. This change in color was also visibly detectable to the naked eye.

Abstract
Difluorocarbene is a simple, readily prepared, and versatile difluorinated one&#8208;carbon synthon. It can be applied as both the difluoromethylating reagent in the carbene insertion and the difluoromethylenating reagent in various cycloadditions and annulations. This concept article provides an account of applications of difluorocarbene in cycloadditions and annulations for synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorocarbocycles and gem&#8208;difluoroheterocycles. The synthesized gem&#8208;difluorocarbocycles include 2,2&#8208;difluorobicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes, 4,4&#8208;/5,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;cyclopentenes, 2,2&#8208;difluorocyclopentanones, and 5,5&#8208;difluorocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enones via tandem [2+1] cycloaddition and ring&#8208;expansion or [4+1] annulations.

Diindeno[1,2,3&#8208;cd:1&#8242;,2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;mn]pyrene, a substructure of fullerene C70, and two of its aza&#8208;analogs were prepared by Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions and acid&#8208;mediated cycloisomerization and final Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H&#8208;activation. The optical and electrochemical properties and the impact of N&#8208;doping on the physical properties have been studied.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been recognized as valuable tool to alter their inherent optical and electrochemical properties and are thought as promising next&#8208;generation semiconductor materials. We herein report the synthesis of diindenopyrene, a fragment of C70 and two of its nitrogen&#8208;doped aza&#8208;analogs. The developed synthetic procedure is based on Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated cycloisomerization followed by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H&#8208;activation as key&#8208;steps. The impact of N&#8208;doping on the optical and electrochemical properties has been studied and the experimental results are supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 2,7&#8208;Functionalized 1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetraethynylpyrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile synthesis of regioselectively multi&#8208;functionalized pyrenes through one&#8208;pot reactions. These reactions involve Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions, which are proven effective in forming 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexaphenylethynylpyrene for the first time. The 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraphenylethynyl pyrenediboronates are essential in synthesizing multi&#8208;functionalized pyrenes, and the results indicate that the Stille coupling reaction is more effective than the Sonogashira coupling reaction in forming these boronate compounds in good yields. Furthermore, the experimental and theoretical investigations into the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the obtained 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;multifunctionalized pyrenes show that the phenylethynyl groups at 2,7&#8208;positions further increase the system conjugation, which is significant in developing new materials with enhanced properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Aspidofractinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fascinating and synthetically challenging bicyclo[2.2.2]octane fused monoterpenoid indole alkaloids belong to the aspidofractinine family of natural products. The present review focuses on the highly inspiring total syntheses of aspidofractinine and aspidofractinine&#8208;like natural products from origin to till date.







Abstract
The fascinating structural features and potential biological activities of aspidofractinine monoterpenoid indole alkaloids grasped the attention of synthetic community since 1964. Aspidofractinine also serves as the primary structural component to over 200 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, in which most of these alkaloids&#8217; total synthesis has been unexplored. In light of these facts, studies on synthetic strategies towards the complex, intriguing carbon skeleton of aspidofractinine have high implications. The intensive studies on the total synthesis of aspidofractinine alkaloids have resulted in numerous elegant strategies to construct the highly substituted hexacyclic core structure containing bicyclo[2.2.2]octane motif and three all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. This review discusses all reported strategies for synthesizing aspidofractinine, and aspidofractinine&#8208;like alkaloids.

         <title>Electrochemical Selective Mono&#8208; and Polychlorination of Substituted Thiophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and efficient electrochemical method for the selective monochlorination, dichlorination, and trichlorination of 2&#8208;substituted thiophenes has been developed.







Abstract
An environmentally friendly and efficient electrochemical chlorination of thiophenes has been developed. The monochlorination, dichlorination and trichlorination of thiophenes are selectively achieved. Notably, the reaction has the merits of mild conditions, excellent functional group tolerance, high yields and selectivity, and the capacity for scale&#8208;up, thus providing a synthetically useful alternative to access mono&#8208; and polychlorinated thiophenes.

         <title>Cytosine&#8208;Functionalized Macrocyclic Receptor for Nucleotides: Combining Three Recognition Motifs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The macrocyclic receptor for nucleotides that combines motifs for electrostatic, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions was designed and investigated. The presence of cytosine in the structure of the receptor increases the affinity and selectivity for guanine&#8208;containing nucleotides and cyclic di&#8208;GMP.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates perform various essential functions and serve as second messengers in living systems. Despite the success of nucleotide&#8208;selective probes based on proteins, the creation of synthetic receptors for nucleoside monophosphates remains a challenging task. In this paper, we explore the design of synthetic receptors based on a combination of three recognition motifs. We show that each binding motif contributes to the formation of the host&#8208;guest complexes. The core macrocycle provides recognition of the phosphate residue of the nucleotide, while naphthalimide and the attached cytosine residue participate in the coordination of the nucleobase via &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonding interactions. The presence of cytosine in the receptor structure substantially increases the overall affinity of receptors for nucleotides. A considerable increase (100&#8208;fold) in binding affinities is observed for the tetranucleotide DNA sequences 5&#8242;&#8208;GGGG&#8197;&#8208;3&#8242; and 5&#8242;&#8208;CCCC&#8208;3&#8242;, as compared to the previously reported system without the attached cytosine.

         <title>Computational Studies on the Tropylium&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylic Acid O&#8722;H Insertion with Diazoesters: The Role of Homoaromaticity
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper describes the role of homoaromaticity in the tropylium ion&#8208;catalyzed carboxylic acid O&#8722;H insertion with diazoesters using DFT calculations. The energy profiles of four different pathways were compared to find the plausible reaction pathway.







Abstract
A tropylium&#8208;catalyzed carboxylic acid O&#8722;H insertion with diazoesters was reported to provide &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters through an activated carbene intermediate. This study presents a revised mechanism based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations involving a unique homoaromatic intermediate formed between the tropylium ion and the diazoester. The calculated energies of the intermediates and transition states support this revised mechanism. Our computational model explains the tropylium ion&#8216;s binding to the diazoester, resulting in the homoaromatic intermediate. By comparing the reaction profiles of four different pathways, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and have potential implications for designing more efficient catalytic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Penta&#8208; and Tetrasubstituted Quercetins and Their Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the synthesis of penta&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted quercetin derivatives and their fluorescent properties. The derivatives were synthesized selectively by etherification in different ratios of acetone and water as solvents. Only molecule 1 emitted fluorescence in an aqueous solution. Furthermore, this quercetin derivative showed non&#8208;cytotoxicity with fluorescent imaging of cells. These results indicate that molecule 1 is a promising fluorescent dye.







Abstract
Quercetin contains five hydroxy groups (OH) at positions 3, 5, 7, 3&#8242;, and 4&#8242;. The selective reaction of a hydroxy group in quercetin is an important strategy for the modulation of various properties of the derivatives. Herein, we report the synthesis of selective quercetin derivatives, wherein the oligoether chains were linked to the hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, the penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than the tetra&#8208;substituted one. The fluorescence behavior of synthetic derivatives was investigated using solvatochromism, molecular aggregations, computational calculations, and hydrogen bonds with solvents. The fluorescent penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative did not show any cytotoxicity up to 600&#8197;&#956;M concentration, showing a novel biocompatible fluorescent molecule.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines have been allowed to become practical and efficient synthetic approaches for the creation of N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and O&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines. This review provides a comprehensive overview for transition&#8208;metal and organo&#8208;catalyzed, as well as visible&#8208;light promoted chemoselective functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines over the past decade, including N&#8208;alkylation, N&#8208;allylation, N&#8208;arylation, N&#8208;alkenylation O&#8208;alkylation, O&#8208;allylation, O&#8208;arylation, and O&#8208;alkenylation.







Abstract
2&#8208;Hydroxypyridines have emerged as versatile nucleophiles in organic synthesis. The N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines affords straightforward and practical methods for the construction of N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and O&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines, which are important structural motifs in numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Nonetheless, the competition between N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines presents an inevitable and formidable challenge. In the past few decades, chemoselective N&#8208; and/or O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines has received extensive attention from the synthetic community, resulting in the development of elegant and effective strategies to address this chemoselectivity. This review provides a summary of recent advancements in the realm of transition&#8208;metal and organo&#8208;catalyzed, as well as visible&#8208;light promoted chemoselective functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines, including N&#8208;alkylation, N&#8208;allylation, N&#8208;arylation, N&#8208;alkenylation, O&#8208;alkylation, O&#8208;allylation, O&#8208;arylation, and O&#8208;alkenylation.

         <title>Ligand Combination Approach in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzothiazole and Benzoxazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two is better than one! A combination of two ligands (Phen.H2O and PPh3) with Pd catalyst offers a highly efficient catalytic system for the direct C&#8722;H arylation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole with aryl halides. Mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effect experiments and computational investigations suggests that two ligands may work cooperatively to enhance the catalytic activity in the reaction.







Abstract
The use of ligand combination approach in the Pd catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole is demonstrated. The combination of two ligands phenanthroline monohydrate (Phen.H2O) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) with Pd&#8208;catalyst have offered the best catalytic properties in the C&#8722;H bond arylation reactions than either of two ligands employed separately in the reactions. This protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope affording C2 arylated benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives in excellent yields. Mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), H/D exchange and competition experiments show that the C&#8722;H bond activation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole is very facile under reaction conditions. Furthermore, different mechanistic pathways originated from the catalytically active species such as Pd(&#951;2&#8208;dba)L (dba=dibenzylidene acetone) and Pd(PPh3)2 were investigated using computational methods. The computational results suggest that the generation of catalytically active species from Pd2(dba)3 is endoergic process and Phen ligand can initiate this step. On the other hand, the presence of PPh3 could be crucial for the oxidative addition of aryl halides which is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>The influence of acceptor acidity on hydrogen bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) through the picoloyl protecting group.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outcome of glycosylation reactions heavily relies on the specific protecting group patterns employed on both the donor and acceptor molecules. The picoloyl (Pico) protecting group stands out as it can steer the stereoselectivity in a glycosylation reaction through hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD). This provides syn&#8208;stereoselectivity, with respect to the stereochemistry of the Pico group, by forming a hydrogen bond between the incoming acceptor and the picoloyl ring nitrogen. We here probe how acceptor acidity influences the stereodirecting effect of the picoloyl protecting group. A set of 3&#8208;O&#8208;functionalized glucosyl and mannosyl donors, each bearing different protecting groups (picolinate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, and benzoate), were synthesized for systematic evaluation. For the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;glucose series, the picoloyl group exhibited minimal influence on stereoselectivity, with only weak nucleophiles showing a modest shift in selectivity for the 3&#8208;O&#8208;Pico protected glucosyl donor in comparison to the other C&#8208;3&#8208;acyl glucosides. In contrast, in the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;mannose series a much stronger &#946;&#8208;directing effect was observed, wherein more acidic acceptors led to increased &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The results provide insights into the complex interplay of acceptor acidity and glycosylation stereoselectivity mediated by the picoloyl protecting group.</dc:description>

The picoloyl (Pico) protecting group stands out as it can steer the stereoselectivity in a glycosylation reaction through hydrogen bond-mediated aglycone delivery (HAD). This provides syn-stereoselectivity, with respect to the stereochemistry of the Pico group, by forming a hydrogen bond between the incoming acceptor and the picoloyl ring nitrogen. We here probe how acceptor acidity influences the stereodirecting effect of the picoloyl protecting group. A set of 3-O-functionalized glucosyl and mannosyl donors, each bearing different protecting groups (picolinate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, and benzoate), were synthesized for systematic evaluation. For the 3-O-picoloyl-glucose series, the picoloyl group exhibited minimal influence on stereoselectivity, with only weak nucleophiles showing a modest shift in selectivity for the 3-O-Pico protected glucosyl donor in comparison to the other C-3-acyl glucosides. In contrast, in the 3-O-picoloyl-mannose series a much stronger &#946;-directing effect was observed, wherein more acidic acceptors led to increased &#946;-selectivity. The results provide insights into the complex interplay of acceptor acidity and glycosylation stereoselectivity mediated by the picoloyl protecting group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of 2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole Embedded Styrene Atropisomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic synthesis of 2,3,4,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole embedded styrene atropisomers has been developed. The styrene derivatives were isolated in good to high yields with high diastereoselectivities. Moderate enantioselectivities were achieved with a chiral catalyst.







Abstract
Herein we report the first synthesis of tetrahydrocarbazole embedded styrene atropisomers via the reaction between 1&#8208;(aryl&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol and 2,3,4,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediate formation. The styrene derivatives were obtained in good to high yields with high diastereoselectivities with a catalytic amount of PTSA. A catalytic asymmetric version is also reported.

         <dc:description>
Efficient de novo access to 2,3&#8208;7&#8208;trisubstituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazoles was successfully synthesized via a regioselective Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The scope of each palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction at each position showed excellent compatibility with a wide range of boronic acids or bromoaryl derivatives.







Abstract
A first access to mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;(Het)arylated pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazoles is reported. The series were generated from a library of 3&#8208;(Het)arylpyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazole platforms selectively functionalized through regioselective arylation procedures. The regioselective functionalization in C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;7 positions was investigated. Each Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling condition was optimized and a representative library of the scope and limitations of the reactions was studied.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Pyridofluoranthenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridofluoranthenes (fluorenoquinolines and &#8208;isoquinolines), N&#8208;doped benzo[b]fluoranthenes, were synthesized by combination of Pd catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with CH&#8208;activation reactions. By variation of the starting material, four regioisomeric products, containing a nitrogen atom at various positions of the outer benzene ring of the core structure, were selectively prepared. The optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of the products were studied and compared with each other using experimental methods and DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations.







Abstract
A series of N&#8208;doped Benzo[b]fluoranthenes was synthesized. Specifically varying the position of the Nitrogen atom in all four positions of the bottom ring. In the last reaction step the five&#8208;membered ring of the unsubstituted core structure is formed by palladium catalyzed CH&#8208;activation. This synthetic approach allows for the selective introduction of heteroatoms into the core structure and leads to four regioisomeric products. Subsequently the optical and electrochemical properties of these polyaromatic heterocycles were compared. DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations were performed to further analyze, how the position of Nitrogen impacts the overall characteristics of the molecules. This composes a thorough study on the chemical behavior of N&#8208;doped Benzo[b]fluoranthenes.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research. Esterification and lactonization promoted by chiral organocatalysts are elucidated as examples of the effective transformations for the kinetic resolution of important chiral carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is a reliable method to prepare important chiral molecules in highly optically enriched forms. Although methods for the catalytic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols, amines, and epoxides have been extensively investigated, the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids has remained under&#8208;developed despite the importance of chiral carboxylic acids. Excellent catalytic approaches for the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids via esterification using chiral organocatalysts have been reported by several research groups. Furthermore, the organocatalyzed lactonization of alkenyl and alkynyl carboxylic acids has also been adapted to achieve kinetic resolution. Herein, the methods typically used to produce the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research.

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.n.1]alkanes and Their Derivatives &#8211; Bicyclic Fluorinated Piperidine Isosteres for Drug Discovery</title>

         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.n.1]alkanes are proposed as promising building blocks for piperidine isosteric replacements in drug discovery. Efficient protocols for the preparation of the title compounds are developed, and the impact of fluorination on the physicochemical properties (pKa(H) and LogP) is established for the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane series.







Abstract
An approach to gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.n.1]alkane&#8208; derived building blocks through double&#8208;Mannich addition&#8211; deoxofluorination sequence is described. The scope of the method was demonstrated for a series of saturated (hetero)cyclic ketones or ketoesters (including five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cycloalkane derivatives and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles). Further transformations of functional groups produced various bifunctionalized difluorinated building blocks, namely, N&#8208;protected aminoacids, mono&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected diamines, and unprotected aminoalcohols in good to excellent overall yields. For the azabicyclo[3.3.1]alkane series, a potential for isosteric replacements is demonstrated by evaluation of the key physicochemical properties (i.&#8201;e., pKa(H) and LogP).

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8208;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY NMR, Mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.</dc:description>
