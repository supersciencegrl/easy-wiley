      <title>Conformationally restricted oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one fused bicyclic iminosugars as potential glycosidase inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of fused bicyclic oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (OZO) iminosugars was achieved through a tandem Staudinger reduction/retro&#8208;Michael/intramolecular Michael addition from the corresponding OZO azidosugars. Those precursors, based on both aldopentofuranoses and ketofuranohexoses backbones, were obtained following alkylation and oxidation of the related oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione (OZT) azidosugars. Eight OZO based iminosugars were isolated in good yields and evaluated for their potency as glycosidases inhibitors, thus extending the family of known 1&#8208;Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) bicyclic analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Isobenzofurans as Synthetic Intermediates: Synthesis and Biological Activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Ajudazol B.</title>
      <dc:description>Ajudazol B is a polyketide secondary metabolite, isolated from the myxobacterium  Chondromyces crocatus  , that exhibits potent biological activity. Here we report a convergent total synthesis of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B. The key step is a regio&#8208;selective alkylation and oxidative rearrangement of a reactive isobenzofuran intermediate that generates the isochromanone core. This approach provides a fast and efficient method to synthesise analogues of ajudazol B from simple aldehydes, allowing assessment of structure&#8208;activity relationships. The antifungal activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B as well as that of related analogues has been assessed using  Botrytis cinerea  . The results indicate that the isochromanone unit is key for antifungal activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
      <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.

      <dc:description>During the synthesis of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives sterically hindered in the 2 and/or 9 positions, serendipity led to the discovery of a new substitution pattern on phenanthroline with good and reproducible yields.

      <title>Conformational lock of glycosyl donors using cyclic carbamates.</title>
      <dc:description>Axial rich glycosyl donors often display superior reactivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylations. In this study, a glucosamine glycosyl donor locked in a  1  C  4  conformation using a six&#8208;membered carbamate ring, i.e. an oxazinone, is synthesized and studied. The 2  N  ,4  O  carbamate is synthesized in one step from the corresponding azide. The glycosylation properties was studied by glycosylating different alcohols. Derivatives of the glycosyl donor were synthesized by introducing Ac, Troc, Ts and Ms groups on the oxazinone nitrogen. The ring opening to give the glycoside in the  4  C  1  conformation was found to proceed smoothly using Zempl&#233;n conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Method for the Divergent Synthesis of C&#8208;9 Functionalised Sialic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Sialic acids, a ubiquitous family of sugars shown to be involved in numerous biologically important processes, exhibit remarkable structural diversity in nature. Access to these derivatives by chemical and enzymatic means is a major bottle neck in understanding the role played by each particular modification. As part of a program to study such roles and determine the substrate specificity of novel sialic acid aldolases, a general and robust synthetic protocol was devised to gain access to all naturally occurring C&#8208;9 functionalised  N&#8208;  acetylneuraminic acid derivatives including esters. These derivatives were synthesised in 11 linear steps from a common advanced intermediate, which allowed for divergent modification at the C&#8208;9 position. Four substitutions were installed in this study: O&#8208;acetyl, O&#8208;lactyl, O&#8208;SO  3  , O&#8208;PO  3  . This synthetic pathway includes both an effective way to benzylate neuraminic acid derivatives, as well as a working methodology towards &#946;&#8208;linked neuraminic acid glycosides.</dc:description>

The stereochemistry of the corresponding products was determined by HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY spectra. The limitations of the method were shown. The reaction of camphor with primary amines led to exclusively  exo  product, while the reaction of fenchone led to exclusively  endo  product.

      <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Harzialactone A and Its Three Stereoisomers by Use of Standardized Polyketide Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
  The Harzialactone A synthesis utilizes a Horner&#8211;Wittig&#8208;reaction of the chiral building block and benzaldehyde in the first step. The formed &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone can be selectively transformed into the syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;diol, which is further converted into the desired natural compound by ozonolysis, cyclization and oxidation in one step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this paper, we present a short and convenient synthesis of the natural product Harzialactone A and its three stereoisomers. In a three&#8208;step synthesis starting from cheap and commercially available benzaldehyde, we created the small polyketidic compound with full control over its two stereogenic centers. To this end, we employed a chiral building block previously described by us, introducing the first stereogenic center through a Horner&#8211;Wittig reaction. The second stereogenic center was installed via stereocontrolled syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;reduction with the corresponding &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone intermediates. Upon ozonolysis followed by oxidation the natural product and its stereovariants were produced with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereopurities.

As saturated analogues of the latter 4&#8208;(cyclohexylethyl)perhydroindanes were prepared.

      <title>Calcium carbide: versatile synthetic applications, green methodology and sustainability</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations.

      <title>Isomerisation of vinyl sulfones for the stereoselective synthesis of vinyl azides</title>
      <dc:description>Reported is the construction, and facile base&#8208;mediated conversation of ten differently substituted 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones (&#947;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sulfones) into their isomeric vinyl azide counterparts. The requisite 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones were prepared from 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones, which in turn were accessed from allyl sulfones via a bromination&#8208;elimination sequence. In relation to this a one&#8208;pot azidation&#8208;isomerisation sequence was developed which enabled the direct formation of the vinyl azides from the corresponding 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones. Similarly, a convenient one&#8208;pot Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination&#8208;isomerisation approach was utilised in order to prepare some of the allylic sulfones used in this study. The vinyl azide forming process typically proceeded with high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity, although this was dependent on the vinyl sulfone substitution pattern. Thus, with either no substituent or a methyl group in the &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, relative to the sulfone, good, to high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity ( Z:E = 85:15 to &#8805;95:5) were obtained. However, incorporation of an &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl methyl substituent led to an E &#8208;selective process ( Z:E = 20:80). A non&#8208;bonding interaction between the azido group and the &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl vinylic proton is proposed, which acts as a conformational control mechanism to help guide the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

  Dibenzo[a,j]acridines have been synthesized in three steps and high overall yields using a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization as the final key step.

  A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis of dibenzo[a,j]acridines is reported which relies on regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloropyridine and subsequent Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization. Products are obtained in good yields and the method is broadly applicable. For selected dibenzo[a,j]acridines, photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied.

      <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Cyclic Azomethine Ylides in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions within the Molecular Electron Density Theory</title>
      <dc:description>The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reactions of cyclic azomethine ylides with a series of acetylene derivatives have been studied within the Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT). Analysis of the Conceptual DFT indices allows characterising the ambiphilic character of these cyclic AYs, thus participating as strong electrophiles and strong nucleophiles in polar 32CA reactions. Analysis of the activation enthalpies associated with the 32CA reactions of these cyclic AYs are found in reasonable agreement with the experimental outcomes. These reactions take place  via  a one&#8208;step mechanism. The 32CA reactions with 1&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;propyne and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate take place through highly asynchronous polar transition states (TSs). On the other hand, the strain present in cyclooctyne allows explaining its participation in a non&#8208;polar 32CA reaction  via  a synchronous TS. The present MEDT study allows establishing that the substitution in these cyclic AYs changes their parent  pseudodiradical&#8208;type  reactivity to the zwitterionic&#8208;type one.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Mobility and Efficiency in Supramolecular Catalysis. A Computational Approach to Evaluate the Performances of Enzyme Mimics.</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, we apply a computational approach, based on DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the catalytic behavior of four supramolecular catalysts active in the cleavage of phosphodiesters. The QM data indicate the operation of a synchronous associative mechanism with limited differences in the structures and energies of the transition states. The comparison with the experimental data, expressed in terms of effective molarity (EM), suggests that the difference in catalytic performance are not ascribable to a difference in the enthalpy of activation. On the other hand, the analysis of the Molecular Dynamics trajectories clearly indicates the conformational mobility, and therefore the conformational entropy, to be at the origin of the superior catalytic efficiency of the catalysts based on a more preorganized structure. Essentially, the combined method presented here provides, at a limited computational cost, a tool that is simple, general, and potentially suited for a large variety of catalytic systems to rationalize their performances and to predict those of enzyme mimics to be synthesized in a rational design process.</dc:description>

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine.

     alt="Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <dc:description>
  CF3O, CF3S, and CF3Se chemistries have been widely described in the last years. Tellurium is the following chalcogen but the CF3Te chemistry remains poorly described. This review presents the different strategies and methods currently available.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Fluorinated substituents confer specific properties to molecules. In the last years, the merging of chalcogenes with trifluoromethyl or fluoroalkyl moieties has known a growing interest. However, the last non&#8208;radioactive family member, namely tellurium, did not receive much attention. This review will present and discuss the state of the art chemistry of RFTe, to describe the available methods and highlight the future developments to consider.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.
