         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established by organocatalytic nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines, providing a straightforward way to achieve the expected C&#8208;N atropisomers in good yields (up to 95%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) from readily available starting materials. Furthermore, axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole derivatives could be prepared upon oxidative aromatization of the corresponding N&#8208;arylindolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the redox potential (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8226; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#183;H2O). TTF+&#8226; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of the Pyoverdine Chromophore: Expanding the Toolbox for the Preparation of Pyoverdine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic strategy for the chromophore core of pyoverdines is reported here, achieved by the coupling of two precursors efficiently prepared from cost&#8208;effective starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8211;DOPA respectively. This strategy was further employed in the first synthesis of the isolated chromophore of pyoverdine D.







Abstract
The pyoverdine chromophore is an important component of a family of siderophores which are secreted by the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa for iron absorption. In this study, an efficient and improved synthetic route to the chromophore structure is reported, beginning from readily available starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8211;DOPA. This strategy has not only delivered the first synthesis of the free pyoverdine D chromophore, but also offers potential access to a wide range of other pyoverdine chromophore species.

         <title>Synthesis of Boron&#8211;Imidazole Complexes and Studies on their Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel fluorophore skeleton imidazo[1,2&#8208;c][1,3,2]diazaborole was developed. Three aryl groups substituted compounds exhibit fluorescence in the solution, solid state, and glass state. Their crystals have multi&#8208;stimuli responsive properties that exhibit mechano&#8208; and thermochromism.







Abstract
Organoboron complexes represented by BODIPY are one of the candidates for fluorescent skeletons exhibiting good fluorescence properties in the solution. However, because most BODIPY have high planar skeletons and small Stokes shifts, their fluorescence is quenched in the solid state. Therefore, numerous approaches were challenged to prepare the solid state fluorescent BODIPYs. On the other hand, an alternative approach to developing solid state fluorophores involves imidazole&#8208;boron complexes. Herein, imidazole&#8208;based boron complexes featuring the imidazo[1,2&#8208;c][1,3,2]diazaborole skeleton were synthesized. This skeleton comprised two fused five&#8208;membered rings and could introduce substituent at the 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions. The boron complexes with aryl groups at the 3,5,6&#8208;positions exhibited fluorescence in both the solution and solid states. These compounds exhibited Stokes shifts exceeding 120&#8197;nm, effectively suppressing self&#8208;absorption. DFT calculations suggested that the large Stokes shift could be attributed to the planarization of &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon excitation. In the solid state, the complexes displayed mechanofluorochromism, with the altered fluorescence color being recovered upon annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Compounds with two or three methoxy groups underwent a phase transition to a glass state, resulting in long&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Furthermore, they demonstrated mechanochromism, thermochromism, and thermofluorochromism in the solid state, indicating their potential as scaffolds for multifunctional fluorophores.

Abstract
An efficient synthesis of polychloroalkylated indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been achieved via aryldiazonium salt induced radical cyclization reaction of N&#8208;methylallyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylindoles with dichloromethane or trichloromethane. In this reaction, neither metal catalyst nor additional oxidant was required, and an isoquinoline ring was constructed by tandem radical additions on the nonactivated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond of allyl group in 2&#8208;arylindoles. This protocol features advantages of wide substituent scope, environmentally friendly conditions and good yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Hemiindigo Derivatives via a Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemiindigos, important indigo derivatives, could be synthesized through the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates.







Abstract
We described a gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of Z&#8208;hemiindigo frameworks from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and in a gram&#8208;scale.

     alt="Synthesis of Hemiindigo Derivatives via a Gold-Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemiindigos, important indigo derivatives, could be synthesized through the gold-catalyzed cyclization from ortho-propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-imino gold carbene intermediates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We described a gold-catalyzed synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-hemiindigo frameworks from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-propynol phenyl azides &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and in a gram-scale. Importantly, this method enables a simple and efficient synthesis of the special hemiindigo derivatives for the development of environmentally sensitive photoswitches in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Repeating Unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Proteus mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) Serogroup O75: Stepwise and One&#8208;Pot Approaches</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of the repeating units of capsular polysaccharides of pathogenic bacteria is important for the preparation of vaccine candidates against diseases. Herein, the chemical synthesis of the repeating unit of the O&#8208;polysaccharide of the Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strain Proteus mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) serogroup O75 O&#8208;antigen is reported.







Abstract
Proteus mirabilis is a pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes several kinds of infections in human beings. Herein, we present the first total synthesis of the O&#8208;antigen tetrasaccharide repeating unit of P. mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) serogroup O75 with an aminoethyl linker appended at the reducing end. The tetrasaccharide comprising D&#8208;glucosamine, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;galactose and D&#8208;galactosamine with a key (1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage between D&#8208;galactose and L&#8208;rhamnose was assembled by three stepwise [1+1+1+1], [1+2+1] and [2+2] assembly approaches and one one&#8208;pot [1+2+1] assembly. The respective routes provided the tetrasaccharide in yields of 23&#8201;%, 18&#8201;%, 20&#8201;%, and 26&#8201;% from suitably protected monosaccharide building blocks.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies and Applications of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bridged Bicyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept aims to highlight the recent advancements in the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing bridged bicyclic compounds (BBCs). The synthetic strategies have been categorized based on the position of functionalization (i.&#8201;e. bridge or bridgehead), as well as in the type of F&#8208;containing motif introduced in the bicyclic core. Additionally, the application of F&#8208;containing BBCs in replacing their arene counterparts within known bioactive compounds, and future directions in the field are discussed.







Abstract
Bridged bicyclic compounds (BBCs) have recently emerged as effective 3D&#8208;isosteres of planar aryl and heteroaryl rings. Current synthetic endeavours are devoted to accessing these complex structures bearing functionalities in different positions of the aliphatic rings. Of particular interest is the incorporation of F&#8208;containing motifs, since it allows the generation of isosteric units with improved physicochemical properties, including lipophilicity, water solubility, or oxidative resistance.

         <title>Aziridination Exploited: A Mechanistic Study of the Divergent Reactivity of Trifluoropropenyl&#8208;iodonium Reagent toward N&#8208;nucleophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoroalkenyl iodonium reagent with secondary amines gives selective access to two classes of fluorinated amines. Combined computational (DFT &amp; microkinetic) and experimental efforts provide guidelines for selectivity prediction. In addition, the study reveals and scrutinizes the importance of a key aminoalkyl iodonium intermediate along the diverging pathways.







Abstract
In this study, we use computations and experiments to explore mechanistic scenarios that govern the reaction between secondary amines and trifluoropropenyl iodonium triflate with the aim of rationalizing and predicting experimental outcomes. Based on the results from theory, we have compiled a list of guidelines relevant to synthetic strategies and provide examples for the interpretation of selectivities. To demonstrate the viability of these strategies, we have performed directed experiments applying different reaction conditions to obtain the products predicted by our model. Additionally, qualitative microkinetic simulations based on our computations were carried out for further support.

         <dc:description>A decarboxylative fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acids was developed by the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalysis system. The fluoroalkyl radicals are generated from &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkyl bromides by nickel&#8208;induced single electron transfer (SET) and are subsequently intercepted by a cinnamic acid to forge the targeted C&#8208;C bonds. A wide variety of substrates bearing a diverse set of functional groups were compatible with the mild reaction conditions (visible light, room temperature, cheap metal, no strong oxidant or reductant), thus affording trifluoromethyl analogues of &#945;&#8208;methylated allylic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable and&#160;selective transformation of aromatic thioether enabled by regulating active species under visible light irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8208;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8226;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8208;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8208;S bond activation and cleavage.</dc:description>

Abstract
We present here the efficient preparation of 6&#8208;N&#8208;haloaryl&#8208;galactosides through a reductive amination process. A complete set of 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2;3,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;6&#8208;N&#8208;phenylamino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranosides were obtained with a straightforward method.

         <title>Halogenated Adenine and Adenosine Natural Products in Streptomyces sp. JCM9888</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the chlorine containing dealanylascamycin producer Streptomyces sp. JCM9888 has a capacity also to brominate to generate C&#8208;2 halogenated adenines and adenosines as well as brominated dealanylascamycin. It is noted that halogenation can occur independently of sulfamoyl moiety assembly.







Abstract
Ascamycin 1 and dealanylascamycin 2 are adenosine containing nucleoside antibiotics carrying the rare 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl ribose motif and a chlorine atom attached to C2 of the adenine ring. Gene knockouts (&#916;acmK and &#916;acmJ) in the producing strain, Streptomyces sp. JCM9888, generated mutants that were disabled in the assembly of the sulfamoyl moiety. This resulted in the production of 2&#8208;chloroadenosine 3 and 2&#8208;chloroadenine 4, indicating that purine halogenation can occur independently of sulfamoylation. Incubations in media enriched in bromide content resulted also in the identification of 2&#8208;bromoadenine 5, 2&#8208;bromoadenosine 6 and 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;bromoadenosine 7.

An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of privileged 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines has been developed utilizing readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketodithioesters as a two&#8208;atom (CS) synthon and 2&#8208;bromohydrazones as a four&#8208;atom (CCNN) unit in a cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization cascade. The method has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provides a direct route to functionalized 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines not easily prepared by other methods.







Abstract
Privileged 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines were synthesized from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketodithioesters as a two&#8208;atom (CS) synthon and 2&#8208;bromohydrazones as a four&#8208;atom (CCNN) unit through a cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization cascade. The operationally simple metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free method shows broad substrate scope as well as high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provides a direct route to functionalized 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines that are not easily prepared by other methods. This one&#8208;pot approach features easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nontoxic reagents, high yields, gram scalability, excellent selectivity and the formation of an exocyclic double bond with Z&#8208;stereoselectivity.

         <title>Photoinduced Intramolecular C&#8722;N Coupling For The Synthesis Of Azolo[1,2,4]Benzothiadiazines Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 4H&#8208;Benzo[e]pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaacephenanthrylenes derivatives by photoinduced intramolecular coupling from of 1&#8208;((2&#8208;halophenyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amines and 1&#8208;((2&#8208;halophenyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines is presented. The synthetic protocol uses only KOtBu and DMSO to generate aryl radicals at room temperature. The reaction was explored with different substituents groups on the starting materials, demonstrating moderate to good products yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78&#8201;%.







Abstract
This paper explores an original synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds derived from photoinduced intramolecular coupling reactions, involving the formation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds. Specifically, two classes of compounds were targeted: 4H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaacephenanthrylenes. The synthetic strategy involved nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare key sulfonamide starting substrates, followed by photoinduced cyclization (via the Substitution Radical Nucleophilic Unimolecular, SRN1) under mild conditions using visible light. The scope of the reaction was explored with different substituent groups on the starting materials, which demonstrated moderate to very good product yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78&#8201;%. Moreover, this strategy represents the first synthetic approach to obtain 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaphenanthrylenes.

         <title>Exploring Interrupted Nazarov Cyclizations Using Tethered Sulfonamide Nucleophiles: Insights into Capture Pathways</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the ionization and cyclization of aza&#8208;alkynyl Prins adducts, uncovering complex mechanisms with competing halo&#8208;Nazarov and imino&#8208;Nazarov pathways. Substrate&#8208;dependent selectivity leads to diverse scaffolds, including cyclopentapyridines and haloindenes. Computationally supported reaction mechanisms are proposed, which involve competitive imino and halo&#8208;Nazarov pathways, and different fates of the cyclized halo&#8208;allyl cation.







Abstract
This manuscript describes a study of diverse reaction outcomes that stem from the ionization of aza&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Prins adducts. Experimental results have demonstrated unexpected behavior in the nitrogen&#8208;containing systems compared to the analogous oxygen derivatives derived from oxa&#8208;Prins/halo&#8208;Nazarov sequences. In&#8208;depth experimental studies and computational analysis revealed an intricate mechanism involving competing halo&#8208;Nazarov and imino&#8208;Nazarov pathways. These findings further elucidate the reaction chemistry of 3&#8208;halo&#8208;pentadienyl cation intermediates, and expand their utility in synthetic transformations.

         <title>Electrooxidative Thiocyanation of Hydroxy&#8208; and Alkoxybenzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an original method for thiocyanating C&#8722;H bonds in various phenols and their derivatives using readily available materials via electrogenerated (SCN)&#8322; and its Zn(II) complex. The process led to a diverse range of target products with yields of 36&#8211;97&#8201;% (include the drug riluzole and precursors for toltrazuril and ponazuril) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We developed an original method for thiocyanation of hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzenes (including naturally occurring compounds) using electrogenerated thiocyanogen, (SCN)&#8322;. The presence of zinc chloride as a Lewis acid significantly enhances reaction efficiency by activating thiocyanogen. Cyclic voltammetry of the reactants and their combinations was employed to optimize reaction conditions and investigate the proposed mechanisms. This method demonstrated broad synthetic utility, leading to mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;thiocyanated arenes and various heterocycles with yields 36&#8211;97&#8201;%. Notable products include the neuroprotective drug riluzole and precursors for the antiprotozoal drugs toltrazuril and ponazuril.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy has been developed to synthesize both complex spiroindanone&#8208;type molecules and benzoisoindole derivatives by taking advantage of the capabilities of sulfoxonium ylide to act as directing group as well as carbene source in the C&#8722;H activation/functionalization reactions, followed by transition metal&#8208;mediated carbo&#8208;annulations in [4+2] or [4+1] with maleimide derivatives







Abstract
A well&#8208;ordered strategy of sulfoxonium ylides as a directing group as well as carbene source for the Ru&#8208;catalysed [4+2] and Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] carbo&#8208;annulations with maleimides has been described. These novel methodologies have been successfully established for the synthesis of complex spiroindanones and benzoisoindoles containing compounds by the transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation/functionalization reactions. Further, Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] annulated compounds were obtained in the absence of any oxidant. A possible rationale for the remarkable divergent selectivity between the two catalysts has been proposed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;(Hetero)Arylation of Amides Enabled Access to Diaryl Acetamides via Umpolung</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free method for the &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of indolyl acetamides was developed. Various (hetero)arylating reagents such as indoles, pyrroles, furan, N, N&#8208;dimethylanilines, and electron&#8208;rich benzenes were tolerated. The usage of an aryloxy group as the activator of amide led to the success of this transformation.

This base&#8208;mediated arylation reaction features mild reaction conditions and broad functional groups tolerance. The scope of (hetero)arylating reagents includes indoles, pyrroles, furan, N, N&#8208;dimethylanilines, and electron&#8208;rich benzenes. The applicability of this protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale experiment and the derivatization of the target products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids with [Me4N][SeCF3]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with the nucleophilic [Me4N][SeCF3] salt was successfully accomplished by copper catalysis using air as an oxidant, furnishing the corresponding alkynyl trifluoromethyl selenoethers in good yields. Mechanistic studies revealed that the copper catalyst plays a key role in the oxidation of [Me4N][SeCF3] and the decarboxylation of alkynyl carboxylic acid for the subsequent trifluoromethylselenolation.







Abstract
The synthesis of alkynyl trifluoromethyl selenoethers from copper&#8208;mediated aerobic decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with [Me4N][SeCF3] is reported. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions and enabled the facile conversion of both aryl and alkyl alkynyl carboxylic acids to the corresponding trifluoromethyl selenoethers in good yields, demonstrating that decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with the nucleophilic [Me4N][SeCF3] reagent is feasible at ambient temperature without irradiation. Advantages of the method include the use of bench&#8208;stable and non&#8208;volatile alkynyl carboxylic acids as starting materials, readily accessible SeCF3 reagent, excellent functional group tolerance, and the avoidance of harsh reaction conditions. This copper&#8208;mediated reaction represents the first decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with a SeCF3 source.

         <title>Vicinal Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Through Radical Addition/Remote (Hetero)Aryl Migration Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vicinal (hetero)aryl functionalization of unactivated alkenes through radical addition of a functional group followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration provides a valuable tactic to install an aromatic ring at a specific position. The migratory (hetero)aromatic ring can be initially tethered to either the alkene or the radical precursor. This review discusses the scope, limitations and mechanistic aspects of these transformations.







Abstract
Alkenes are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic molecules and constitute versatile building blocks. Remarkably, their radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization offers a valuable synthetic tool for rapidly accessing multifunctional compounds through a step and atom&#8208; economy process. More particularly, the addition of (hetero)aromatic groups onto alkenes is of particular appeal given the numerous applications of aromatic compounds in various fields. However, such process becomes difficult when attempted on simple non&#8208;conjugated aliphatic alkenes (unactivated alkenes). In this context, the (hetero)arylation of unactivated alkenes through the radical functionalization followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration has recently emerged as a powerful opportunity to address the lack of reactivity of such &#960; systems. The advances in radical chemistry have led to a flood of synthetic methods to trigger the addition of a carbon&#8208; or heteroatom&#8208;centered radical/(hetero)aryl migration sequence. Interestingly, the migration of the aromatic ring can take place from various atoms. This feature has spurred the design of several substrates allowing such a process to occur. This review intends to provide an overview of the contributions according to the type of substrates that have been employed.

     alt="Vicinal Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Through Radical Addition/Remote (Hetero)Aryl Migration Cascade"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vicinal (hetero)aryl functionalization of unactivated alkenes through radical addition of a functional group followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration provides a valuable tactic to install an aromatic ring at a specific position. The migratory (hetero)aromatic ring can be initially tethered to either the alkene or the radical precursor. This review discusses the scope, limitations and mechanistic aspects of these transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenes are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic molecules and constitute versatile building blocks. Remarkably, their radical 1,2-difunctionalization offers a valuable synthetic tool for rapidly accessing multifunctional compounds through a step and atom- economy process. More particularly, the addition of (hetero)aromatic groups onto alkenes is of particular appeal given the numerous applications of aromatic compounds in various fields. However, such process becomes difficult when attempted on simple non-conjugated aliphatic alkenes (unactivated alkenes). In this context, the (hetero)arylation of unactivated alkenes through the radical functionalization followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration has recently emerged as a powerful opportunity to address the lack of reactivity of such &#960; systems. The advances in radical chemistry have led to a flood of synthetic methods to trigger the addition of a carbon- or heteroatom-centered radical/(hetero)aryl migration sequence. Interestingly, the migration of the aromatic ring can take place from various atoms. This feature has spurred the design of several substrates allowing such a process to occur. This review intends to provide an overview of the contributions according to the type of substrates that have been employed. The reaction scope, limitations and mechanistic aspect will be discussed with the aim of stimulating efforts in this research area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, with advantages associated with a metal&#8208;free approach.

Abstract
Intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. While there are limitations in the scope of C&#8722;H bonds amenable to C&#8722;H insertion under photochemical conditions relative to metal catalysed C&#8722;H insertions, the benefits of conducting these synthetically powerful transformations in a metal&#8208;free approach offers &#8220;green&#8221; advantages. Recent advances in technology have revolutionised the potential for use of photochemical transformations in synthesis, including the wavelength control enabled by LEDs and the benefits associated with continuous flow processing which overcome many of the traditional challenges associated with synthetic photochemistry including scale&#8208;up. The potential for telescoping the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds and downstream photochemical reactions is clear. This review summarises the development of intramolecular photochemical C&#8722;H insertions and highlights the benefits of recent technological advances.

         <title>Diazo&#8208;Based Construction of Heterocyclic Systems Via a X&#8722;H Insertion/Cyclization Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept outlines an X&#8722;H insertion/cyclization cascade (X=heteroatom), a prominent strategy for the assembly of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles from diazo compounds and X&#8722;H&#8208;tethered precursors. While focusing on the cyclization via an addition to multiple bonds, we have highlighted Michael&#8208;type and Conia&#8208;ene reactions, aldol condensation, and Mannich reaction as prevalent ring&#8208;closing modes.







Abstract
The X&#8722;H insertion reaction (X=heteroatom) of diazo compounds has emerged as an eminent and reliant approach for the construction of C&#8722;X bonds. By merging X&#8722;H insertion with the sequential ring&#8208;closing transformations, diverse heterocyclic systems can be obtained in a step&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, the X&#8722;H insertion/cyclization cascades and one&#8208;pot transformations attract more research attention, especially in the area of asymmetric synthesis. Concentrating on the assembly of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles, this Concept elucidates the various combinations of X&#8722;H insertion reactions with cyclization via an addition to multiple bonds. The ring&#8208;forming strategies reviewed comprise of Michael&#8208;type and Conia&#8208;ene reactions, aldol condensation, and Mannich reaction.

         <dc:description>Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Based pH&#8208;Responsive Configurational Molecular Rotary Switches Containing a New Conjugated &#960;&#8208;Electronic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocyclic scaffold derived hydrazone&#8208;based molecule was explored as a pH&#8208;activated molecular switch. It undergoes hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization, followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization to show switching properties.







Abstract
A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocycle derived pH&#8208;activated, hydrazone based molecular switch and its switching mechanism are reported here. The introduction of a new conjugated &#960; electronic framework (enone part in the molecule) allowed the system to undergo hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization, followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization through rotation around the partial C&#8722;N single bond. Under acidic pH, protonation took place selectively on pyrimidinone nitrogen, and that turned the molecule to the corresponding ZH+ configuration. On the other hand, addition of triethylamine in the same solution reverted the molecule back to its original E&#8208;configuration. Extensive proton&#8208;NMR, and detailed X&#8208;ray crystallography coupled with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were carried out to establish the switching phenomena. Theoretical DFT calculations leading to free energy diagrams, transition states, and intermediates shed light on the mechanism behind the switching phenomenon.

&lt;p&gt;A pyrido-pyrimidinone heterocyclic scaffold derived hydrazone-based molecule was explored as a pH-activated molecular switch. It undergoes hydrazone-azo tautomerization, followed by &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pyrido-pyrimidinone heterocycle derived pH-activated, hydrazone based molecular switch and its switching mechanism are reported here. The introduction of a new conjugated &#960; electronic framework (enone part in the molecule) allowed the system to undergo hydrazone-azo tautomerization, followed by &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;E-Z&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; isomerization through rotation around the partial C&#8722;N single bond. Under acidic pH, protonation took place selectively on pyrimidinone nitrogen, and that turned the molecule to the corresponding &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; configuration. On the other hand, addition of triethylamine in the same solution reverted the molecule back to its original &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;E-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;configuration. Extensive proton-NMR, and detailed X-ray crystallography coupled with UV-vis spectroscopy were carried out to establish the switching phenomena.

         <title>Furano&#8208; and Thieno&#8208;Fused Carbazole&#8208;Containing Azaborines and Their &#960;&#8208;Extension: Synthesis, Structures, and Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of carbazole&#8208;containing BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds fused with furans and thiophenes as well as their &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives were synthesized to provide a deep understanding of the structural effects of the fused ring moiety, the patterns of the ring fusion, and &#960;&#8208;extension, which finely tuned the molecular properties including the solid&#8208;state emission.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;containing azaborines, furano&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2F and 1&#8211;3F and thieno&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T, were efficiently synthesized from a common carbazole boronic acid ester in two steps. The structural effects of the fused ring moieties and the patterns of the ring fusion were clarified. According to X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, the furano&#8208; and thieno&#8208;fused carbazole azaborines had planar structures and generally formed 1D columns. UV&#8211;vis analysis revealed that their absorption properties were significantly affected by the fused ring moieties. In contrast, the fluorescence properties were affected by the ring fusion patterns. &#960;&#8208;Extended derivatives of 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T, benzothieno&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2BT and 1&#8211;3BT and phenyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8211;2T&#8208;Ph2 and 1&#8211;3T&#8208;Ph2 were synthesized, and the effects of &#960;&#8208;extension on physical properties were also investigated. All the &#960;&#8208;extended compounds showed red&#8208;shifts in absorption and fluorescence spectra compared with the pristine 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T. The color of solid&#8208;state emission of the synthesized azaborines was tuned from purple to green without electron&#8208;rich or &#8208;deficient substituents. The structural effects on the electronic structures were also discussed based on theoretical calculations.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective C&#8722;H Arylation of Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specifically arylated heteroarenes constitute privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Commonly used transition&#8208;metal based approaches present cost and environmental related issues, demanding sustainable alternatives. This article reports the recent transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8722;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes. Arylations of several five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur containing heteroarenes using various arylation/heteroarylation reagents are comprehensively reviewed.







Abstract
Regioselectively arylated heteroarenes are privileged scaffolds with remarkable biological and optoelectronic properties. Traditional arylation approaches based on the transition&#8208;metal catalysis present various issues related to the cost of synthesis and environmental sustainability. The growing applications of arylheteroarenes in pharmaceuticals and cutting&#8208;edge technologies have fuelled interest in the development of green and cost&#8208;effective synthetic approaches. This article reports the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8722;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes. C&#8722;H arylations of several five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur containing heteroarenes using various arylation/heteroarylation reagents are comprehensively reviewed.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Enolizable 5&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;Acceptor cyclopropanes undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with 5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles, producing the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts. At ambient temperature, the product of S&#8208;attack are most commonly obtained, whereas upon heating, the products of formal N&#8208;attack are observed. Test experiments demonstrated that the initial products of the studied reactions are formed via the S&#8208;attack exclusively. The product distribution is also dependent upon the cyclopropane's aromatic donor group.







Abstract
Diversely substituted dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (DACD) react under mild conditions, at ambient temperature in the presence of catalytic scandium triflate, with enolizable 5&#8208;meracaptotetrazoles. Most commonly, this yields the corresponding 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts via insertion of the S&#8208;atom into the strained C,C bond, leading to ring&#8208;opening. Control experiments performed with dimethyl 2&#8208;phenylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate and 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole demonstrated that the initial product of the reaction is the corresponding sulfane, formed via S&#8208;insertion. However, thermal rearrangement performed at 60&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of the isomeric N&#8208;insertion product. This rearrangement is accelerated by electron&#8208;donating substituents present at the para&#8211;position of the arene. In contrast, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents prevent this rearrangement at room temperature, and in these examples the S&#8208;insertion products were formed exclusively.

U&#8208;PSD TREPR is a powerful time&#8208;resolved EPR technique that offers both high sensitivity and temporal resolution, making it an ideal tool for the detection of weak signals of transient radical intermediates in solution&#8208;phase chemical reactions over a wide time range.

Abstract
Radical chemistry is an important research field that plays a vital role in life science, material science, and energy conversions. However, directly visualizing the transient open&#8208;shell intermediates unambiguously in radical chemistry is a significant and long&#8208;standing challenge. Recently, we have developed an innovative ultrawide single&#8208;sideband phase&#8208;sensitive detection (U&#8208;PSD) time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) technique, which enables the characterization of diverse transient radical intermediates and mechanistic studies close to reaction conditions. In this brief review, we will offer an outline of the principles underlying our U&#8208;PSD TREPR technique, and present examples highlighting the technique's ability to accurately characterize and track free radical intermediates in photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Varying the Electronics on Isothiourea Catalysts: Basicity, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted benzoisothiourea catalysts were studied to understand how changing catalyst electronics affects rate and selectivity in a model reaction. This information ultimately indicates how intermolecular interactions are affected between catalyst and substrates.







Abstract
Chiral and achiral substituted isothiourea catalysts were synthesized and employed in model silylation reactions to understand how changing the electronics on the catalyst core affected intermolecular interactions between catalyst intermediates and substrates, ultimately affecting selectivity and rate. Five different chiral catalysts were utilized in a silylation&#8208;based kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;(para substituted)phenylcyclohexanols and the rate of silylation of these same alcohols was investigated with three different achiral catalysts. Linear free energy relationships were examined, highlighting that rate and selectivity were highly dependent on the electronics of the catalyst and the substrate, and that both affected the intermolecular interactions that resulted.

         <title>Direct Introduction of Perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) Groups into Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct strategies towards the incorporation of perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8722;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8722;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms are discussed in detail. Future directions and perspectives in the field are suggested.







Abstract
The direct addition of perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) groups to organic frameworks has seen a resurgence in interest due to the benefits of these groups in late&#8208;stage modification of pro&#8208;drugs and biologically active compounds, helping to identify new active leads. The presence of &#8722;CORF groups positively impacts the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds. In that sense, both polar methods and radical protocols have been developed for the direct syntheses of trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl ketones. In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late&#8208;stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl&#8208;substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8722;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8722;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table&#8197;1.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Electrochemical Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes with 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present an efficient organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities in the synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylated 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines.







Abstract
Acridine scaffolds are present in biological and pharmaceutical molecules. However, achieving asymmetric functionalization of acridines remains challenging without an efficient and highly stereoselective approach. Here we demonstrate a facile electrooxidative asymmetric dehydrogenative coupling reaction of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes. This method offers a sustainable and effective route to various chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylation of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities facilitated by readily available aminocatalyst. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetric analyses reveal that this asymmetric electrochemical reaction proceeds through redox&#8208;mediated oxidation, followed by a nucleophilic attack with concurrently generated enamine. We anticipate that our research will open avenues for promising exploration in organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective transformations.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropionitriles Via Selective Monomethylation of Aryl Acetonitriles Using an Easy to Handle Methylation Agent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only one! Using a safe, easy to handle, and solid methylating agent, selective monomethylation of aryl acetonitriles is achieved. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and can be applied in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients potentially leading to compounds with increased biological activity due to the renowned magic methyl effect.







Abstract
A convenient and safe methylation protocol employing quaternary ammonium salts (PhMe3NI) as alternative methylating agents for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles is presented. This approach allows for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques, while offering a practical and sustainable solution for late&#8208;stage functionalization in medicinal chemistry. The straightforward and safe nature of this methodology makes it particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in drug discovery. In our report, we present a diverse set of 18 examples, achieving yields of up to 76&#8201;%.

Fused pyrimidine has garnered significant research interest because of its diverse biological activities and potential drug applications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest synthesis methods for fused pyrimidines from azole amines, including the Michael reaction, multi&#8208;component reaction, metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction, photocatalytic reaction, peroxide&#8208;mediated reaction, and anti&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction.







Abstract
Fused pyrimidines are a class of heterocyclic compounds that have gained considerable interest due to their extensive biological activities and potential applications in drug development. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest synthetic approaches to fused pyrimidines, including Michael reactions, multicomponent reactions, metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, photocatalytic reactions, peroxide&#8208;mediated reactions, and inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Furthermore, the biological activities of these compounds, such as their ability to combat cancer and microbial infections, are also discussed. This review article summarizes the existing literature on the synthesis and biological activity of fused pyrimidines from 2020 to 2023.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Chemoselective Reductive Cyclization: Synthesis of Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Thioxanthenes and 10&#8208;Methyl 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines and Beyond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;thioxanthenes are synthesized directly via In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization reaction passes via highly chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion by the intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent). N&#8208;Methyl 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines are also synthesized under a Bronsted acid catalyzed reductive cyclization in isopropyl alcohol.







Abstract
Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;thioxanthenes are obtained from 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes via In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization in diisopropyl ether at elevated temperature. The reaction possesses broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility and proceeds via chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion in the presence of a highly reactive arylaldehyde. Similarly, unsubstituted 10&#8208;methyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines are also obtained via a Bronsted acid catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;(methylphenylamino)benzaldehydes in isopropanol (solvent). The reductive cyclization method can also be utilized for the synthesis of 9&#8208;trifluormethyl containing (thio)xanthenes. Mono&#8208;deuterated 9H&#8208;thioxanthene is obtained in moderate yield in deuterated solvent (THF&#8208;d8).

&lt;p&gt;Unsubstituted 9H-thioxanthenes are synthesized directly via In(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2-(arylthio)benzaldehydes in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization reaction passes via highly chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion by the intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent). N-Methyl 9,10-dihydroacridines are also synthesized under a Bronsted acid catalyzed reductive cyclization in isopropyl alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsubstituted 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthenes are obtained from 2-(arylthio)benzaldehydes via In(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization in diisopropyl ether at elevated temperature. The reaction possesses broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility and proceeds via chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion in the presence of a highly reactive arylaldehyde. Similarly, unsubstituted 10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridines are also obtained via a Bronsted acid catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization of 2-(methylphenylamino)benzaldehydes in isopropanol (solvent). The reductive cyclization method can also be utilized for the synthesis of 9-trifluormethyl containing (thio)xanthenes. Mono-deuterated 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene is obtained in moderate yield in deuterated solvent (THF-d8).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Pyramidalization of sp2 Centers in 3/2&#8208;Systems Is a &#8220;Structural Breathing&#8221; Independent of Energy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 3/2&#8208;systems, such as the acetate anion H3C&#945;C&#8242;OO&#8722;, an sp3 center and an sp2 center are connected by a covalent bond. The interaction of threefold and twofold symmetry results in the pyramidalization of the sp2 center during rotation about bond C&#945;&#8722;C&#8242; for rotation angles&#8800;0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176;, enforcing a pyramidalization/rotation profile with three maxima, three minima, and six zero&#8208;crossings as indicated by the triangles in the diagram.







Abstract
In 3/2&#8208;systems, such as the acetate anion H3C&#945;C&#8242;OO&#8722;, an sp3 center and an sp2 center are connected by a covalent bond. The interaction of threefold and twofold symmetry results in the pyramidalization of the sp2 center during rotation about bond Esp3&#8722;Esp2. Rotation angles &#968;=0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176; account for conformations with a symmetry plane containing the planar sp2 center C&#945;C&#8242;OO. However, in all conformations with rotation angles &#968;&#8800;0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176; this symmetry plane is lost and pyramidalization must occur with maxima at rotation angles &#968;=&#177;30&#176;, &#177;90&#176;, and &#177;150&#176;, because the two sides of the sp2 center C&#945;C&#8242;OO are different. Inevitably, this leads to a pyramidalization/rotation profile &#952;/&#968; with three maxima, three minima, and six zero&#8208;crossings. Thus, myriads of 3/2&#8208;compounds pyramidalize their sp2 centers each moment to the order of about 2&#176; in a coupled pyramidalization/rotation molecular motion independent of energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Mediated Fragment Library Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubsituted Cyclobutane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobutanes have attracted significant interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potential advantages in pharmacological properties. In this study a two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of cyclobutanesulfonamides with either carbamates or triazoles was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between ethenesulfonyl fluoride and tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether as the key step.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes have attracted significant interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potential advantages in pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes remain underrepresented, both in the general chemical space and in fragment&#8208;based drug discovery libraries. In this study, a two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of cyclobutanesulfonamides was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between ethenesulfonyl fluoride and tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether as the key step. The sulfonyl fluoride was subsequently transformed into various sulfonamides, whereas the tert&#8208;butyl ether was converted into carbamates and triazoles to synthesize a fragment library. Overall, this synthesis contributes to addressing the underrepresentation of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane fragments, making a valuable addition to the field of fragment&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Photo&#8208;and Electrochemical Modification of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins through Cysteine: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for the modification of cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed. Additionally, the current limitations of these methods and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future are also explored.







Abstract
Chemical modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as an efficient strategy to study and manipulate the physical and chemical properties and biological functionalities of proteins. Among the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine is one of the most frequently targeted residues for chemical modification of peptides and proteins due to its unique thiol group and its relatively low natural abundance. Cysteine is able to partake in radical and atom&#8208;, electron&#8208; and hydride&#8208;transfer reactions taking the benefit of redox activity of thiol side chain. Recently, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry have emerged as influential methodologies for enabling novel transformations in organic synthesis. These two fields both involve the generation of radical intermediates through single electron transfer processes, which align well with the redox activity of cysteine residue. Furthermore, the mild and controllable features are suitable for solving the chemo&#8208; and regioselective problems of the existing bioconjugation strategies. Given the intrinsic benefits of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis, the application of developing novel cysteine&#8208;based bioconjugation methods is increasingly compelling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for modifying cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed.

         <title>Construction of Multiple Five&#8208;Membered Rings in Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene Core for the Synthesis of a Nona&#8208;Cycle Buckybowl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relevant synthesis to an unexplored nona&#8208;cycle buckybowl (C28H14, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene) is described. The key precursor is a solution&#8208;processable hexacycle having twofold bromines and fourfold ethers. The bromines enabled forming the first two pentagons, and then the ethers facilitated yielding the nona&#8208;cycle C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;structure, unattainable so far.

C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, commonly referred to as &#8220;buckybowls&#8221;, are provocative compounds, and their inviting functions based on the non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation are expected. Yet, achieving synthesis of some kinds of the curved structure remaining challenging. Herein we report skeletal construction of a nona&#8208;cyclic buckybowl that is synthetically unachievable heretofore, namely, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene. The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible process in which a multiple substituted dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is amenable to threefold formation of five&#8208;membered rings at its periphery. The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution&#8208;phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Mechanofluorochromic Molecules and Their Differential Mechanochromic Effects Triggered by Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the position of the nitrogen atom, three anthracene&#8208;based mechanofluorochromic compounds were designed and synthesized. The three compounds exhibit similar photophysical properties in solution, but exhibit completely different photophysical properties and mechanofluorochromic properties in the solid state.







Abstract
To investigate the influence of nitrogen atoms on the mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties, three novel anthracene&#8208;based MFC compounds were designed and synthesized, and the effects of nitrogen atom position changes on their photophysical properties and MFC properties were deeply explored. The structure of the three compounds maintains the anthracene and enone portions unchanged, with only subtle adjustments made to the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine moiety. Experimental verification revealed that these three anthracene&#8208;based compounds exhibit almost identical photophysical properties in solution but display significantly different fluorescence colors and distinct MFC properties in the solid state. The findings of this study not only offer a new perspective for understanding the MFC mechanism of anthracene&#8208;based compounds but also provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel MFC molecules.

         <title>The Gauche&#8208;Effect in 1,2&#8208;Bis(arylsulfonate)ethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure of ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzenesulfonate)ethane, was elucidated, revealing a gauche&#8208;conformation through single crystal diffraction studies. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital of the sulfonate groups and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche conformation.







Abstract
With an aim of obtaining a fundamental understanding of C&#8722;C bond conformation theory, the molecular structure of an ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzene&#8208;sulfonate)ethane, was elucidated. According to the general conformation rule for alkanes, which states that molecules adopt a stabilized structure to avoid steric repulsion, ethanes typically adopt anti&#8208;conformation. However, the title compound exhibited gauche&#8208;conformation, as revealed by a single crystal diffraction study. Theoretical studies also support this behavior. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital, attributable to the sulfonate groups, and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche&#8208;conformation. The authors conclude that the sulfonate group acts as a gauche&#8208;effect synthon, which is widely applicable in organic chemistry.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes and Other Unsaturated Systems: A Literature Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes and different &#960;&#8208;systems offers easy access to highly substituted arenes and heteroarenes. Nickel catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool for replacing expensive platinum group metals for cyclotrimerization reactions. This review summarizes the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni&#8208;phosphine, Ni&#8208;NHC, Ni&#8208;pincer, Ni&#8208;diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined. Highly substituted arenes have broad applications in pharmaceuticals and soft materials. The applications of cyclotrimerization in these areas have been illustrated.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation Reactions of Acetylene: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed the first efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of acetylene toward &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides. The synthetic utility of our protocol was showcased further in the diversification of ibrutinib and other bio&#8208;active molecules, demonstrating great potential for drug discovery.







Abstract
The simplest alkyne, acetylene, is a suitable C2 linker synthon that enables the connection of organic molecules with different functional groups. However, reactions of acetylene with advanced organic building blocks are much less explored compared to substituted alkynes. In this article, we present a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation reaction with acetylene, CO, amines, and perfluoroalkyl halides that enables the preparation of various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides in one step. This protocol also provides a new strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules, as demonstrated by the construction of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl ibrutinib derivatives.

         <dc:description>
An organophotocatalytic perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of acrylamides is demonstrated. This role of pendant functionality in achieving molecular diversity was established. This reaction manifold provides access to diverse fluorinated and thiolated molecular architectures.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, organophotocatalyzed cascade perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of o&#8208;cyano and o&#8208;alkynyl acrylamides is reported. The reaction exhibits wide scope and provides polyfluorinated 1,3&#8208;quinoline diones and trifluoromethylated fused tricyclic quinolinones under mild reaction conditions and in good yields. Access to a variety of molecular architectures and the synthetic application of aliphatic thiols are the highlights of this reactivity manifold.

The reaction exhibits wide scope and provides polyfluorinated 1,3-quinoline diones and trifluoromethylated fused tricyclic quinolinones under mild reaction conditions and in good yields. Access to a variety of molecular architectures and the synthetic application of aliphatic thiols are the highlights of this reactivity manifold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preferential Binding to a Mannoside of a Pyridine&#8211;Acetylene&#8211;Phenol Macrocycle with a Fluorine Substituent in the Cavity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrocyclic host having a fluorine atom in the recognition site. This macrocycle showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside because the fluorine atom acted as a moderate infill that prevented the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside.







Abstract
We developed a pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol macrocycle in which a fluorine atom was introduced in place of a hydroxy group, as a host for the selective binding to epimers of glucose. The fluorine atom was expected to work as a negatively charged infill repelling oxygen atoms of saccharides and prevent the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside, whose cross&#8208;section size is larger than those of the corresponding epimers, especially of a mannoside. UV&#8211;Vis and fluorescence titration experiments revealed that this host showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside. 1H NMR and molecular modeling suggested that the fluorine atom acts as a moderate infill weakening the binding to a glucoside. This result indicates that selectivity for guest molecules can be modified by replacing a hydroxy group and a hydrogen atom in host molecules with a fluorine atom.

         <title>Copper(II)/Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Sequential Annulation&#8208;Olefination of 2&#8208;Arylquinoxalines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed sequential annulation&#8208;olefination reaction has been developed for the rapid construction of ortho&#8208;olefinated 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines with broad substrate scope, high mono&#8208;substitution selectivity and ortho&#8208;regioselectivity. Application to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules led to compounds with enhanced antiproliferative activities against ovarian cancer and colon cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The quinoxaline scaffold occurs in many pharmaceuticals, natural products and organic materials. In this study, a Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective annulation&#8208;olefination sequence for the formation and modification of quinoxalines was developed using ethanol and water as the solvent, with relatively broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. This protocol has been successfully applied to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the derivatives exhibited enhanced antiproliferative activities against A&#8208;2780 and HCT&#8208;116&#8197;cell lines, underscoring their potential as promising lead compounds for ovarian cancer and colon cancer treatment.

We have developed an efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. This work presents a remote selective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and the directing groups modifiability highlights the method's significance for pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
An efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids is developed. This acetoxylation protocol is performed under room temperature using N&#8208;fluorobenzene&#8208;sulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, exhibiting a wide range of functional group tolerance and affording &#948;&#8208;position&#8208; selective products up to 85&#8201;% yield. Notably, a diverse set of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs is also found to be compatible under the current reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction presumably proceeds through a seven&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.

1,4,2&#8208;Dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;one serves as a safe and efficient alternative to acyl azides in the Staudinger reaction, enabling the synthesis of N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes under metal&#8208;free conditions. This method involves a heat&#8208;promoted nucleophilic attack of phosphines on 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, leading to CO2 extrusion and formation of the P&#8722;N coupling product. The effectiveness of this metal&#8208;free imidization was demonstrated in gram&#8208;scale reactions and its applicability to subsequent transformations.

         <title>Synthesis of [6,5,5]Ring&#8208;Fused Tricyclic Triazoles by Copper&#8208;Promoted Double Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was coupled with cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles. Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was investigated on 2&#8208;iodoaryl propynes or propynones. With catalytic amount of Cu(I) salts or with N&#8208;donor ligands on copper only the products of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions were formed. However, with an equimolar amount of copper(I) iodide and triethylamine new [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles were formed by azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditon coupled to a cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important biologically active compounds and synthetic intermediates. Known methods for their synthesis are limited mostly to triazoles fused to six&#8208;membered or larger rings. Herein we disclose a synthetic approach to triazoles fused to five&#8208;membered rings based on copper(I)&#8208;promoted double cyclization consisting of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, followed by cross coupling to aryl iodides.

         <title>Synthesis of Double Benzimidazole&#8208;Fused Quinazolines and Pyrimidines Catalyzed by Recyclable Magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>

A synthetic method of double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines was developed by recyclable magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic/vinylic substitution and oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208;/2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with benzimidazoles.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Bromoaryl)&#8208; and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles are combined and cyclized with benzimidazoles using a catalytic amount of magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 (Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74) and a base under O2 atmosphere, yielding the corresponding double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines. The catalyst can be recovered using a magnetic bar and reused multiple times without significant loss of catalytic activity. The reaction mechanism likely involves the initial formation of a C&#8722;N coupled intermediate through nucleophilic aromatic substitution, followed by oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Electrochemical N&#8208;Centered Radical&#8208;Triggered Intramolecular N&#8722;N Coupling for the Cyclization of o&#8208;Aminyl Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes via N&#8208;centered radical generation has been developed. This method enables the construction of N&#8208;heterocycle in an efficient manner. A wide range of functional groups are amenable to the established system, providing rapid access to benzotriazoles and their derivatives.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes via N&#8208;centered radical generation has been developed for the synthesis of benzotriazoles. The cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes bearing a sulfonyl protection on amine readily proceeds in the absence of any external transition metal catalyst or chemical oxidant, and exhibits good tolerance towards functional groups.

         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Adaptable Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Disaccharide Subtypes Preprogrammed for Regiospecific O&#8208;Sulfation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors is presented herein. The route employs an orthogonal protecting group pattern and a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach to access CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O disaccharide precursors on gram scale. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors, including rarer subtypes such as CS&#8722;D, has been developed. From common intermediates, a series of thioglycoside D&#8208;glucosyl donors and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected D&#8208;galactosamine acceptors are utilised in a robust glycosylation reaction, achieving &#946;&#8208;selectivity and consistent yields (60&#8211;75&#8201;%) on scales &gt;2.0&#8197;g. A post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation to D&#8208;glucuronic acid and orthogonal protecting groups delivers access to CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O precursor subtypes. Of further note is a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl regioselective reductive ring opening of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected disaccharide using dichlorophenylborane (PhBCl2) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH) to access a CS&#8722;D precursor, in 73&#8201;% yield over two steps. Finally, synthesis of a 6&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated CS&#8722;C disaccharide containing a conjugable anomeric allyl tether is completed. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalysis for the Oxidative Dearomatization of PyrroleDerivatives: Mechanistic Insights and Biological Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported an oxidative dearoamatization of pyrrole derivatives to give a highly functionalized isoindolinone derivatives. Synthesized products have been analyzed for their non&#8208;cytotoxic behavior and two of them have been utilized for their antipromastigotic activity against L. Donovanai. In addition to that the mechanism has also been explored using DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report dearomatization of pyrrole ring followed by rearomatization of cyclohexyl ring to obtain isoindolinone scaffold by a Pd/Cu dual catalysis approach in an atom economic way with moderate to high yield. The expected Pd/Cu catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8208;H activation via normal catalytic cycle can be override by unusual oxidative dearomatization reaction which has been established by DFT calculation. The biological importance of isoindolinone scaffold insists us to successfully investigate in&#8197;vitro antileishmanial activity of L.Donovani.

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin as Efficient Catalyst for Sonogashira Coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi Type Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been successfully applied as catalyst in Sonogashira coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation reactions, performed under air and copper&#8208;free conditions using very small metal loading (between 0.25 and 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%).







Abstract
A palladium catalyst supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been tested in the Sonogashira coupling reactions of a wide range of aryl iodides and terminal alkynes. The best catalytic performance was obtained at 90&#8201;&#176;C using only 0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;% metal loading under copper&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of a H2O/EtOH (3&#8201;:&#8201;2 v/v) solvent mixture and triethylamine as the base, affording the coupling products in good yields. The Pd/SF&#8208;based protocol was then successfully extended to the synthesis of benzofurans through Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation of 2&#8208;iodophenol with terminal alkynes. Preliminary investigations on the recyclability and the heterogeneous behaviour of the catalyst were performed: hot filtration test and leaching test evidenced the presence of a small amount of soluble active palladium species into the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, Pd/SF could be reused in recharging test and it can be recycled in four consecutive runs with no significant deactivation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five [n,n]&#8208; and [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals with five, six and seven membered rings were prepared by using a formal method from cheap starting materials and reagents and applying simple procedures. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of a more complex spiroacetal, namely the spiro[isobenzofuran&#8208;1,20&#8208;naphtho[1,8b,c]furan] skeleton of the enantiomeric couple oleocaran and elmonin, as an example demonstrating its potential.







Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n=5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n=5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <title>N&#8208;Arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;Diarylphenazines as Tailored Organophotoredox Catalysts for the Reductive Activation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of strongly reducing organophotocatalysts is synthesized and evaluated for the photocatalytic activation of olefins without any sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and suitability as organophotoredox catalysts is investigated using the addition of methanol to a&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The results are supported by spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A small library of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines, N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines has been synthesized as strongly reducing organophotocatalysts without the need for sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and their suitability as organophotoredox catalysts for the efficient activation of olefins was investigated using the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The findings were supported by DFT calculations. Three photocatalysts were identified that allowed quantitative yields with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading and 20&#8197;h irradiation by a 365&#8197;nm LED. The catalyst loading was gradually reduced to 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% and the irradiation time was reduced to only 20&#8197;min. These experiments revealed that N,N&#8208;diisobutyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;amine is the most efficient photocatalyst among the N&#8208;arylphenothiazines. This chromophore combines high electron density introduced by the diisobutylamino phenyl group with high absorptivity at 365&#8197;nm caused by the phenylene bridge to the phenothiazine core. In an attempt to shift the excitation wavelength into the visible light range for selectivity and sustainability purposes (potential use of sunlight as a light source), N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines were designed that exhibit a red&#8208;shifted and broad absorbance shoulder into the visible range, but only N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines allow photocatalysis and the one&#8208;electron activation of alkenes by visible light (450&#8197;nm LED).

The Front Cover features an abstract representation of two novel, highly reducing organophotocatalysts derived from N&#8208;arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines, compounds widely recognized as versatile and effective photoredox catalysts. The catalysts shown are the most efficient from a library of 17 catalysts synthesized. They show remarkable performance in the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene, which was used as a model reaction, significantly reducing the reaction time and the catalyst loading by more than 20 times. Alongside the featured catalysts, the cover shows abstract representations of photophysical and photocatalytic concepts. The authors used spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations to further elucidate their findings and derive structure&#8211;activity relationships that might help to further improve organophotocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) display unique biochemical activities. However, their facile synthesis remains a big challenge due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilicity and alkalinity natures. Recently, the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical process provides a robust tool for various bond formations due to the high reactivity and less sensitive to steric hindrance of radical species. This review summarizes the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Effect&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Dithioacetal Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for discovering bioactive compounds can be time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive, often requiring extensive synthesis and evaluation. To address these challenges, this study combines TLC&#8208;based assays with dithioacetal mixture&#8208;library preparation, enabling rapid and effective bioactivity screening. Tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin production and fruit browning, serves as a significant therapeutic target in this context. Despite the substantial potential of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in medicinal chemistry, the use of dithioacetals in drug discovery remains limited. In this study, two small libraries of dithioacetals, comprising more than 150 compounds, were prepared as mixture&#8208;libraries and screened on TLC by directly measuring tyrosinase activity on the plate surface. This approach facilitated the efficient preparation and identification of a potent, simple, and readily accessible dithioacetal inhibitor of tyrosinase, with the entire process being conducted on a low milligram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing Chemoselectivity in Alkanolamines: A Panoramic Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review has concentrated on providing a thorough overview of the proposed mechanistic basis of the transformations where the inherent reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8722;O/&#8208;N) have been regulated or reversed to achieve desired chemoselectivity. The factors influencing the activation or deactivation of either functional group, in order to facilitate chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines is also summarised.







Abstract
The most challenging aspect of chemical synthesis has always been attainment of high chemoselectivity levels. This review will provide a panoramic view on how the innate reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8722;O/&#8208;N) can be controlled or reversed for the chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines. A comprehensive compilation of reports encasing various methodologies developed to accomplish selective O/N functionalisation in amino alcohols has been documented. In this review, we go over a number of findings that have been studied in recent decades using a variety of synthetic approaches. To help us organize and emphasize the important ideas that have been emerging as a result of these research, we have concentrated on the suggested mechanistic basis of the reactions that are being surveyed.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic transformations initiated by photochemical activation have been at the forefront of reaction discovery.&#160;In this study, we present a formal photochemical [3 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloaddition using&#160;N&#8208;aryl cyclopropylamines and N&#8208;aryl cyclobutylamines in conjunction with&#160;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems, unveiling two distinct mechanistic pathways. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition is elucidated as being guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Simultaneously, intermolecular [4 + 2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines is achieved by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Reassignment of the Structure of Setosol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using computational methods and comparison of reported NMR data, the reported structure of setosol, an unprecedented benzoxonin fungal natural product, is shown to be incorrect. Setosol is shown to be identical to a known but unnamed diaryl ether.







Abstract
By a combination of computational methods and comparison of spectroscopic data, the benzooxonin structure proposed for setosol is shown to be incorrect. The correct structure is that of a known biaryl ether natural product.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Allylic Addition to Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative (deutero)hydroallylation of (hetero)arenes has been realized via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium, thus providing rapid access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. Based on a chiral auxiliary strategy, the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation reaction was also investigated.







Abstract
In comparison with the well&#8208;established allylic additions to C=O, C=N, and C=C double bonds, the dearomative allylic addition to arene &#960;&#8208;systems is heavily underdeveloped due to the severe challenge in breaking aromatic resonance stabilization. Herein, we disclose a general and efficient dearomative allylic addition to chromium&#8208;bound arenes using allylsilanes as the pronucleophiles, thus affording convenient access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. With commercially available deuterium sources, the versatility of this strategy further enables an arene dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuteroallylation with a high level of deuterium incorporation. Finally, a preliminary try on the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation based on a chiral auxiliary strategy is described.

         <title>Ambient Pressure Hydroformylation &#8211; A Key Step to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs is presented. In our previous work, the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes was used to generate an aldehyde from an alkene via rhodium catalysis to be employed in a subsequent tandem reaction to obtain BODIPY dyes. However, the use of higher pressures and therefore autoclaves as well as their necessary equipment might limit others to use this method. The refined approach in this work employs ambient pressure hydroformylation, done in a simple Schlenk tube and using a CO/H2 balloon, as key step towards an easier meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPY synthesis. Additionally, the use of MTBE instead of chloroform as reaction solvent results in a greener approach. Readily available and easily synthesizable alkenes as well as different pyrrole building blocks can be used to extend the range of known alkyl&#8208;BODIPYs. The synthesis of 23 derivatives with overall yields of up to 67% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the refined method.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction Reactions Mediated by Organic Molecules: Recent Advances and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction has emerged as a promising approach, in which organo&#8208;mediators can gain electrons from the electrode to form active intermediates and then efficiently activate the substrates through the electron transfer process. This review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.







Abstract
Electroreduction is an important aspect of organic electrochemistry. Its chemistry does not require the addition of additional reductants, making it an effective alternative to various traditional reduction reactions. Among them, organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction is recognized as a promising approach. Organo&#8208;mediators can be reduced directly at the cathode to form reactive radical anions that subsequently reduce the substrate via electron transfer (ET) to initiate the reaction being investigated. Organo&#8208;mediators typically have a more positive reduction potential, and their role in the whole reaction is similar to that of catalysts. Their addition transforms the ET process from the original heterogeneous process into a homogeneous one. Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction can effectively avoid the over&#8208;electrolysis of the substrate and the product at the electrode and the intolerance of sensitive substrates or functional groups during electrolysis, thereby preventing the occurrence of side reactions. It can also prevent the excessive consumption of reagents and electrical energy while promoting the reaction to achieve higher or completely different selectivity. Considering the advantages of this type of reaction, this review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) Applied to the Synthesis of API Impurities: A Case Study in Oxidative Decarboxylation of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was applied to identify new methodologies to achieve oxidative decarboxylation of arylcarboxylic acids in a rapid and cost&#8208;effective manner. The two oxidant systems discovered (RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 and CAN) were used to obtain a series of popular API impurities, which are essential for impurity profiling during drug development.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) has dramatically impacted experimental reaction development by enabling the rapid exploration of a diverse set of reaction conditions. During the past few decades, HTE has evolved as a tool to expedite reaction discovery and optimization. This work details the application of HTE to synthesize impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ketone/aldehyde functionality, specially focusing on ibuprofen impurity E. Initial experiments using K2S2O8 as oxidant yielded moderate results. Subsequent HTE screens identified cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 as new effective decarboxylative oxidants, with RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) achieving the highest yield of 65&#8201;%. This optimized method was successfully applied to synthesize ibuprofen impurity E on a gram scale. Additionally, the applicability of these methods to obtain other API related substances, such as naproxen impurity L and ketoprofen impurity A, was demonstrated. This research highlights the potential of HTE to streamline the synthesis of API impurities, making them widely accessible for pharmaceutical development purposes.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of Oxindoles and Isoquinolinediones via the Radical Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Monoalkyl Cesium Oxalate Salts by Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylated oxindoles and isoquinolinediones were synthesized by visible light induced radical addition/cyclization reaction of N&#8208;arylacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts. This method does not contain photocatalysts, is easy to operate, and has a wide range of substrates.







Abstract
A photocatalyst&#8208;free cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts is described. In the presence of visible light and (NH4)2S2O8, monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkylated oxindoles. In addition, N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides could be applied for the cascade reaction, providing a series of alkylated isoquinolinediones, which are completely different from the products obtained with monoalkyl oxalates as substrates.

         <dc:description>
A facile transition metal&#8208;free divergent sulfonyl amidine synthesis has been demonstrated with low reagent loading at room temperature. The sulfonyl amidine synthesis presents a wide array of thioamides derived from primary and secondary amines with different electron&#8208;deficient sulfonyl amides. Further, the protocol's utility is explored with late&#8208;stage modification of the drugs.

         <title>Silver(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Syntheses of Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After a broad screening of Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids, AgNTf2 was shown to catalyze the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical triarylmethanes (TRAMs) in moderate to excellent yields (30&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 35 examples) with the tolerance of ester and cyano groups.







Abstract
The synthesis of triarylmethanes was evaluated in the presence of various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids under the same stoichiometric conditions. An efficient silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of triarylmethanes is reported. The reaction offers low catalyst loadings and quasi&#8208;stoichiometric conditions (1&#8211;1.2&#8197;equiv. of electrophile) to access to symmetrical and unsymmetrical TRAMs in moderate to excellent yields (35 examples). Broad substrate scope was observed, including compatibility with ester and cyano groups.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Macrocyclization for the Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes: Recent Updates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of catalytic enantioselective macrocyclization for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes is provided. There are three primary methods for accessing these frameworks: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. These methods enable the control of the planar chirality during the macrocycles construction, significantly enhancing the synthesis efficiency. These accomplishments have significant implications for drug discovery, chiral catalysts, and materials science.







Abstract
The planar chirality of macrocycles is a fascinating research topic. Locking the configurational flip between the benzene ring and macrocycle leads to planar chirality, which can significantly enhance the biological activity of cyclophanes. Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes are widely used in pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and functional materials. However, accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes via asymmetric catalysis has remained challenging. Among the various strategies, asymmetric macrocyclization provides a powerful tool for accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes. This method allows for control of the planar chirality when constructing the macrocycle and greatly improves the efficiency. There are three types of macrocyclization reactions: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. In addition, the chiral confinement strategy breaks through conservative synthetic approaches. This review summarizes these achievements, aiming to highlight the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclophanes and inspire interested researchers.

         <title>Denitrative Functionalization of Nitroarenes: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroarenes can be readily synthesized from arenes through direct nitration, and their functionalization via C&#8722;NO2 bond cleavage offers a rapid approach for the modification of arenes. The method not only streamlines the synthetic routes but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;H bonds. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
Nitroarenes are fundamental feedstocks in the chemical industry. Their relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond allows for late&#8208;stage modifications of molecules and exhibits complete orthogonality to the reactivity of C&#8208;halogen bond in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes holds significant appeal due to it avoids the use of aryl halides, thereby simplifying reaction steps and improving atom and step economy. Recent progress in direct denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes includes palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, copper&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, as well as metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot C&#8722;NO2 functionalization. In this review, we provide a concise overview of these advancements, detailing the reaction features and mechanisms. This summary aims to highlight the versatility and efficiency of denitrative functionalization methodologies, offering insights into their potential applications and inspiring further research in this promising area of organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se Bond Formation via Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se bond formations via three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes. Decade developments were categorized into three types, which include (1) C&#8722;S/C&#8722;Se bond formations using radical strategies; (2) Reactions triggered by three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; (3) Reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed conditions and others. Mechanisms have been given for nearly all reactions.







Abstract
Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three&#8208;component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8722;S/S&#8722;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco&#8208;friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three&#8208;membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring&#8208;opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.

         <title>Elemental Sulfur Promoted Cyclization of o&#8208;Chloronitrobenzenes and Aryl Isothiocyanates to Furnish 2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to afford 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles often involve the use of o&#8208;aminothiophenols or aniline&#8208;typed precursors. Herein we describe a method to furnish 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles through the cyclization of o&#8208;chloronitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates with the assistance of elemental sulfur. From the perspective of step economy, our strategy allows for the direct use of nitroarene precursors without further reduction to anilines. The scope of the reaction with respect to both substrates was investigated, and it was found that electronic properties of the aryl isothiocyanate was important for obtaining acceptable yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.</dc:description>

In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and scaled-up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thione Based on [2 + 3] Annulation Trapping of &#945;&#8208;Keto Sulfine with Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2 + 3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in situ&#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3 + 2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8208;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8208;H or O/N/S&#8208;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Alkenes via Chalcogen Bond: Chalcogen&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; Bond Catalyzed the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 2&#8208;Vinylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis is a promising catalytic strategy, characterized by its environmental friendliness, relatively inexpensive cost, and similar reactivity to transition metal catalysis. Experimental results suggest that the S&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; and Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonds can efficiently drive the vinyl&#8208;indole&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9395&#8208;9400). In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;vinylindoles has been investigated based on density functional theory. For this reaction, the Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis is as an alternative catalytic strategy. The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction catalyzed by chalcogen bond is stepwise and involves two steps: the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation process and the cyclization process. The cyclization process is the rate&#8208;determining step. From the perspective of energy decomposition analysis, the electrostatic interaction is the main factor to cause Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis, the polarization interaction is the main factor to cause Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis. Additionally, this catalytic reaction involves the endo pathway and exo pathway. The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.</dc:description>

The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and highly efficient methodology for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols has been established. Using the Earth&#8208;abundant and air&#8208;stable chromium salt catalyst and the phosphine&#8208;free ligand, the developed Cr&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling provides 1,3,5&#8208;triazines and pyrimidines with high yields and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been estab&#173;lished that multifunctional photoswitches with several norborna&#173;diene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the correspon&#173;ding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;315&#160;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;520 nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lifes of 1 to 2 days. Moreover, the photo&#173;chemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5 + 1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5 + 2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component.

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic mechanistic study employing&#160;kobs&#160;kineticsmeasurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) / H2O in 50 % MeCN / CH2Cl2&#160;at 25.0 &#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961; = &#8208;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2&#160;and 4&#8208;NO2&#160;substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in situ from TCCA and the benzyl alcohol, as the actual oxidizing species. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2&#160;in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient catalytic system employing TMS&#8226;OTf for the regioselective thiolation of electron&#8208;rich arenes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been developed. The reaction occurs in a solvent mixture of dichloroethane and trifluoroethanol under mild conditions, with the addition of water. This method furnishes a range of para&#8208;thio&#8208;substituted arenes and 3&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;indoles in good to excellent yields, marking a significant advancement in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodoaniline Dependent Formation of N&#8208;Aroylguanidines versus 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolinones from Palladium(0) Catalysed Aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;Arylguanidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
A family of N,N&#180;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70%&#8722;92% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70%&#8722;93% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the &#8208;C(O)Ar unit in N&#8208;aroylguanidines contain 2&#8208;aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.</dc:description>

A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2-iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2-aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2-aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above-mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the -C(O)Ar unit in N-aroylguanidines contain 2-aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both.

         <dc:description>A binary mixture of organic salts, also known as ionic liquids, [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] denoted as BmIL1 has been ex&#8208;plored as bifunctional catalyst for the selective synthesis of 2 &#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions. The methodology has been extended to the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones via another pathway from different precursors under the same catalytic system. Greener synthesis of existing drugs reestablished the multifunctionality of BmIL1. Gram scale synthesis of both the products, DFT calculations and sc&#8208;XRD data add significance to the developed protocol. Moreover, high atom economy and eco&#8208;scale values justify the sustainability of the methodology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A squaramide moiety introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline produced an organocatalyst that promoted the direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. A variety of aldol adducts, majorly from the reaction cyclohexanone with aldehydes, were obtained in yields generally in the range of 53&#8208;99%, accompanied by 71&#8208;97% ee and 82:18 to &gt;99:1 diastereomeric ratios. An asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3'&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8208;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;Fluoro Analogues of Febrifugine and Halofuginone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel synthesis of racemic cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight&#8208;forward seven&#8208;step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination&#8208;allylation sequence&#160;generating&#160;a mixture of N&#8208;Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation&#8208;methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the N&#8208;Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the cis&#8208;diastereomer favours a conformation where the F&#8208;atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its trans&#8208;stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2&#8208;substituent overrides any F&#8208;atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO&#8208;d6 and as their free&#8208;bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65:35 ratio of trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the trans&#8208;isomer was 94.3&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1, whereas for the cis&#8208;isomer it was 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of Nmethylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have realized the photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction, enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures and excellent yields.&#160;Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst load, strong regional control and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by the density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be easily accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoiodine Catalysed Intramolecular C&#8722;N bond Oxidative Coupling for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Monosubstituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8211;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal and additive&#8208;free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N,3&#8208;diarylpropanamides via in situ thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation&#8208;dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Catalyzed Cascade C&#8211;H Functionalization: An Atom&#8208;Economical Strategy to Access Diverse 2&#8208;Substituted Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails a one&#8208;pot, cascade carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Bronsted acid and a ligand source at the in situ generated I(III) centre. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors. Mechanistic studies were carried out, and the synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated for the synthesis of the benzothiazole&#8208;based antitumor drug GW&#8208;610.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Semisaturated Fused Polycyclic Iminosugars by a Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars were synthesized by one&#8208;pot stereoselective three&#8208;component reactions of D&#8208;ribose tosylate, aniline and cycloenones under heating conditions. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. In this way, various novel complex fused iminosugars were obtained through a normal Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism at 80 &#176;C. This strategy will enable the preparation of bioactive iminosugar analogues with structural diversity.</dc:description>

A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates. Use of Rh2(Oct)4 (2 mol.%) leads to chemoselective [3+3]&#8208;annulation producing 1,2&#8208;oxazine&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives. With lower catalyst loadings (0.03 mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategy for C&#8211;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarized a strategy for C&#8211;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field. Cubane, known as a bioisostere of benzene ring, and its functionalization hold significant potential for future drug development. However, owing to its highly strained and thermodynamically unstable nature, the methodologies are limited and their precise and diverse functionalization is challenging in current organic chemistry. In this Concept, we categorized and explained these methodologies, which represents a majority of current cubane C&#8211;H functionalization. In addition, we discussed recent advancements in catalytic C&#8211;H functionalization methods, demonstrating their potential to address these challenges effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A new CuI/oxalamide catalytic system for the large&#8208;scale aerobic oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8208;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100 mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Gel that Exhibits Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsiveness and High Conductivity Through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;Ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed to the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases via the syn conformation in DNA.</dc:description>

The reaction involves sulfonylation and dearomative ipso&#8208;cyclisation in a domino fashion. This approach features the use of readily accessible precursors, wide functional group tolerance and external oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions. The practicality of the method was also illustrated by scale&#8208;up reaction and further diversification of the product</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium in Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis: Unique Reactivity, Mechanisms and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged as a prominent research area in modern organic synthesis and environmental science. As an important transition metal, chromium has garnered widespread attention in the field of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis in recent years, primarily manifested in the following aspects: a) the unique photochemical properties of chromium(III) complexes endow them with longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes and higher reactivities; b) by harnessing visible light to induce single&#8208;electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer to generate radicals, which subsequently form alkyl&#8208;chromium(III) intermediates with chromium(II) ligands, these intermediates can selectively attack electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of target products; c) following metals like cerium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and bismuth, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction pathways in chromium photocatalysis have also been extensively investigated.This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their unique reactivity, mechanisms, and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hydroboration of Ketones and Imines Using Amidophosphine&#8208;borane under Catalyst&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines, yielding the corresponding&#160;secondary alcohols and secondary amines&#160;under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions. Solid amidophosphine boranes, which are easy to synthesize, and easy to handle demonstrated excellent reactivity and functional group tolerance toward a wide variety of ketones and imines, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substitutions, thus showing excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sulfoCy5&#8208; and sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8211;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8211;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer&#8208;indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.</dc:description>
