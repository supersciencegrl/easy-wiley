         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Iodobenzene Dichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the irradiation of visible light, &#945; heteroarylation of aliphatic alcohol was achieved under gentle conditions selectively in the present of iodobenzene dichloride. The Minisci type cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction was performed in the absence of metal and acid. Readily available primary alcohols and electron&#8208;withdrawing heteroarenes can be applied smoothly. Mechanism study indicated that the PhICl radical and chlorine radical formed from iodobenzene dichloride were responsible for the selective hydrogen atom abstraction of alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of New Cytotoxic Aplaminone Derivatives from the Sea Hare Aplysia kurodai and Elucidation of Their Accumulation from Local Sea Algae through the Food Chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shell&#8208;less herbivorous marine mollusk (sea hare)&#160;Aplysia kurodai, is known to contain a variety of bioactive substances. While these compounds have been thought to originate from sea algae or their associated microbes, most of their origin and acquisition pathways are still unclear. Six new cytotoxic aplaminone derivatives, bromodopamine&#8211;terpenoid hybrid molecules, were isolated from&#160;A. kurodai. Among them, isoaplaminone had a reverse prenyl group at the C15 aliphatic chain, which is a rare structural feature from the viewpoint of terpenoid biosynthesis. Investigation for chemical components in&#160;A. kurodai&#160;and the sea algae collected at several different locations revealed that two major aplaminones were contained in the&#160;Laurencia&#160;complex species at specific sites. Our chemical and ecological studies provide new insights into the origin of marine alkaloid toxins and their dynamism through the food chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic Addition of N&#8208;Acyl Radicals: In Batch and In Flow Organophotoredox &#945;&#8208;Amination of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective organo photocatalytic addition of N&#8208;acyl radical to aldehydes was studied in batch and under continuous flow conditions, with different homemade photoreactors, affording chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in up to 85&#8201;% e.e. In&#8208;flow process afforded the product in higher productivities (60&#8197;times higher) and improved space time yields (increased up to 113&#8197;times) compared to the batch reactions.







Abstract
The organophotoredox catalytic enantioselective addition of N&#8208;acyl radicals to aldehydes, to afford enantioenriched N&#8208;acyl 1,2 aminoalcohols was studied. Under the best conditions, in batch, the product was isolated in up to 52&#8201;% yield and 85&#8201;% e.e., using a low cost and commercially available chiral imidazolidinone as organocatalyst. The reaction was then studied in flow, exploring different experimental setups and photoreactors. Although modest yields were obtained, the in&#8208;flow process afforded the product in higher productivities (up to 60&#8197;times higher) and improved space time yields (increased up to 113&#8197;times) compared to the batch reaction, with no loss of stereoselectivity.

The Front Cover shows a picture of a Ramen bowl, the famous Japanese noodle soup, that allegorically sketches the combination of the different aggregation states of the amphiphilic GCase pharmacological chaperone, object of our study. The slices of meat depict the solid state, while the boiled egg represents the micellar aggregates in solution (above the cmc). The noodles in the soup represent the misfolded GCase enzyme, which is stabilized by our compound as a monomer in the nM concentration range and symbolized by the spoon. Cover picture created by the skill of Tessa Biondi. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Lo&#8197;Nostro, C. Matassini et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Role of Dethreading Process in Pseudorotaxanes and Rotaxanes towards Advanced Applications: Recent Examples</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxanes are a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), constituted by at least a thread surrounded by a wheel, which are widely employed in the research field of artificial molecular machines. Although applications retaining the integrity of the mechanical bond are usually reported, the dethreading of the components can be crucial in order to develop some advanced applications. Thus, different dethreading strategies have been reported and also advanced applications which require such a process have turned out to be suitable approaches towards machine&#8208;like operation. This review article covers recent examples of applications of pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes in which dethreading processes have a key role to accomplish the desired function.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Thiolated Aryl Esters Enabled with Thiocarbonate through Catellani Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a one&#8208;step strategy for the efficient syntheses of 2&#8208;arylthio aryl esters by palladium/norbornene/copper cooperative catalysis using thiocarbonate as bifunctional reagents. It is worth mentioning that this strategy accommodates broad substrate scopes wtih excellent functional group tolerance and can be easily scale&#8208;up.

Herein, we report a palladium/norbornene/copper co&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;step approach that merges selective ortho C&#8722;H bond esterification with ipso thiolation for construction of synthetically versatile 2&#8208;arylthio aryl esters under exceptionally mild conditions. Importantly, this process proceeded in a highly efficient manner, allowing alkoxycarbonyl and thio groups to be installed into one aryl iodides simultaneously by harnessing thiocarbonate as bifunctional reagent. The method has been demonstrated to accommodate good functionalities and features broad substrate scope.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aculenes B and D</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of aculenes B and D was accomplished in 14 and 16 steps, respectively, from a known hydroxy carboxylic acid by employing a diastereoselective Barbier reaction as the key step. Reversal of the stereoselectivity was observed between the Barbier reaction of a &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;aldehyde intermediate and that of its acetal&#8208;protected congener.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of aculene D, a structurally rare nordaucane&#8208;type natural product exhibiting quorum sensing inhibitory activity, has been accomplished from a known five&#8208;membered hydroxy carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic addition of methallylzinc bromide to a &#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde intermediate under Barbier conditions to install the secondary hydroxy group on the seven&#8208;membered ring of aculene D gave the corresponding alcohol with an undesired configuration predominantly. On the other hand, the protection of its keto group as the ethylene acetal induced a reversal of diastereoselectivity, affording a desired diastereomer in a selective manner. The construction of the seven&#8208;membered ring was realized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis using a triethylsilyl&#8208;protected monocyclic diene ester precursor. An additional five&#8208;step manipulation on the cyclization product including the installation of an ethyl group on the five&#8208;membered ring completed the synthesis of aculene D, whose esterification with an N&#8208;protected l&#8208;proline followed by deprotection also achieved the first total synthesis of aculene B.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins with Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones Induced by Visible Light under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green protocol was developed for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;hydroxycoumarin derivatives, only using the Fukuzumi photocatalyst and visible light to obtain hybrid drug&#8208;like molecules in a single step.







Abstract
Direct and selective C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has become a promising strategy to increase molecular complexity with a high atom economy. This study describes an efficient and straightforward protocol for the regioselective C3&#8208;H/C3&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin derivatives with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural drugs, promoted by visible light under aerobic conditions at room temperature. With this approach, a wide range of hybrid drug&#8208;like molecules were prepared, using air as the terminal oxidant. Remarkably, the C4&#8208;OH group at the coumarin ring is essential for the reaction and has been used as a handle for diverse functionalizations of the final products. Moreover, sunlight can promote the reaction under very mild and sustainable conditions, even on a gram scale. Qualitative and semi&#8208;quantitative tools were used to demonstrate the greenness advance of this methodology over previously reported ones. Several experiments were conducted to propose a plausible mechanism for this transformation.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines with Organoboron Reagent Enabled by Organic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work disclosed a concise and environmental approach for the rapid alkylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, providing a new route to versatile intermediates of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. Stable organoboron reagents have shown their ability in the photoinduced aerobic cross&#8208;coupling reactions, allowing the construction of challenging Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond.







Abstract
We describe an efficient method for &#945;&#8208;functionalization of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines under visible&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation catalyzed by organic photocatalyst. This protocol provides a concise and environmental approach for the rapid allylation and benzylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, and shows broad substrate scope. Stable organoboron reagents have shown their ability in the construction of challenging Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond. The load of the photocatalyst is low and the oxidant is inexpensive and less toxic.

         <title>Radical Arylaminoformylation of Activated Alkenes to Amides Containing All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ag+/S2O82&#8722;&#8208;inducted radical process for functionalized succinyl diamides bearing a &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center through one&#8208;pot aminoformylation/aryl&#8208;migration/desulfonylation cascade has been proposed. This protocol with good tolerance to oxygen and water provides a complementary way for the aminoformylation/aromatization of alkenes as well.







Abstract
Herein we report an Ag+/S2O82&#8722; inducted measure for functionalized succinyl diamides bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter via a radical aminoformylation/aryl&#8208;migration/desulfonylation cascade. The improved process is developed employing readily available and inexpensive oxalic monoamide as a carbamoyl radical precursor through radical Smiles rearrangement. Additionally, the tolerance to oxygen and water, operational simplicity, convenient reagents, as well as scalability, enhance the practical value of the proposed synthesis strategy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides in a tailored fashion represents a challenging task of prime interest in chemical biology and organic synthesis. We strategically transform the phenol ring within Tyr into a chelating group to further direct a C&#8722;H acetoxylation event. As a result, acetoxylation occurs regardless of the Tyr unit position within the peptide sequence.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acetoxylation of Tyr&#8208;containing peptides is described. The method relies on the use of a removable 2&#8208;pyridyloxy group as directing group and is distinguished by its reliable scalability and easily tuned regioselectivity to perform mono&#8208; and diacetoxylation reactions. Remarkably, the assembly of L&#8211;DOPA peptidomimetics is beyond reach upon cleavage of the directing group.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 6, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meroterpenoids fornicin A (1), ganodercin D (3), and fornicin D (2), found in mushrooms of the Ganoderma genus, have been prepared in a concise and divergent synthesis route, starting from readily accessible building blocks.







Abstract
The meroterpenoids fornicin A, fornicin D, and ganodercin D, found in mushrooms of the Ganoderma genus, have been prepared in a concise and divergent synthesis route. The characteristic unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoacid moiety was obtained via an optimized step&#8208;wise aldol condensation between two readily accessible building blocks. THP&#8208;protection of a phenolic hydroxyl group under basic conditions was developed, a protocol that adds to the versatility of this protecting group.

(E)&#8208;(Quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene oligomers with a maximum of six repetition units were successfully synthesized through multistep reactions using Wittig coupling of different quinoxaline units.







Abstract
New oligomers based on quinoxaline units were successfully synthesized through multistep reactions using Wittig coupling, affording (E)&#8208;(quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene oligomers. Diverse quinoxaline&#8208;based phosphonium salts were designed and synthesized, enabling versatility and compatibility regarding the oligomer&#8208;building process. The characterization of the oligomers showed excellent stereoisomer specificity, i.e., a fully E&#8208;configurated conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. The oligomers&#8217; light absorption/emission profiles indicate potential properties for an application in materials science.

Abstract
A novel protocol for the assembly of polysubstituted 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrazines and 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cycloalkyl[b]pyrazines has been developed by the sequential three&#8208;component reaction of primary aliphatic amines, 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) and oxalyl chloride. This synthetic sequence proceeds by initial aza&#8208;Michael addition of the amine to the azo&#8208;ene compounds and subsequent ring closure involving the oxalyl chloride. The ready availability of the starting materials as well as the high level of practicability of the reaction and work&#8208;up make this approach an attractive opportunity towards these uncommon systems.

         <title>Carpet Beater Molecules: Synthesis and Characterization of Functional Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8211;Alkyne Coupling Products</title>

         <dc:description>
A library of nine HBC&#8208;alkyne hybrids with enlarged &#960;&#8208;systems is presented. The iodide HBC served as a very suitable starting material for double Sonogashira reactions with several phenyl&#8208; or quinoxaline&#8208;based coupling partners. Spectroscopic analyses were performed and discussed as the varied substitution pattern changed the optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Within the scope of this paper, nine &#960;&#8208;expanded mono&#8208;substituted 5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBC) are introduced. 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene served as precursor and was reacted with ethynyltrimethylsilane in a Sonogashira coupling reaction. The acetylene unit is used as a linker and can undergo another Sonogashira coupling reaction combining different phenyl coupling partners with the HBC core. The electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as nitrile, pyridine and carbonyl species (aldehyde, methylester, carboxylic acid) as well as the three quinoxaline based species (diphenylquinoxaline, dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine) serve as substitution moieties. Their influence on the optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy demonstrating a maximum redshift of 7&#8197;nm compared to starting compound 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl) HBC. As for the phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substituted HBC a dramatic decrease in the intensity of the absorption of the UV/Vis spectrum was observed. The fluorescence spectroscopy pointed out that the dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substitution changed the spectra to one broad peak departing from the characteristic HBC&#8208;like emission pattern.

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;4 picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.







Abstract
The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable cis&#8208;&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;4 configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The area of combining bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalysis to construct organic molecules has seen tremendous progress in recent years. In this context, enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalysts, combining the advantages of both enzymatic and metal catalysis, provide excellent opportunities to develop novel chemo&#8208;enzymatic reactions in a single pot. Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the construction of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalyst [Pd(0)&#8208;CALB@SiO2] via encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B and Pd(0) within silica. Next, the applicability of the newly constructed biohybrid was demonstrated by catalyzing the sequence of Groebke&#8722;Blackburn&#8722;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling in a single&#8208;pot to produce clinically significant imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives. Interestingly, both entities, i.e., CALB enzyme and Pd(0)&#8208;metal of hybrid catalyst, exhibited good catalytic activity during this approach.&#160;Further, the generality of this protocol was explored by using differently substituted boronic acid, which gave related products in 49&#8208;87% isolated yield. Next, the synthetic utility was proved by set&#8208;up a gram scale reaction which provided the complementary product in 81 % yield. Also, the developed biohybrid was found to be reusable up to five catalytic cycles. The shelf&#8208;life of the biohybrid catalyst was tested by storing it at room temperature for up to 30 days, and no change in catalytic activity was observed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Chemical principles together with CASE and DFT methods were used to reassign unusual polyenols as nucleosides.







Abstract
Unusual polyenols that defied chemical principles were reassigned as the nucleosides, adenosine and uridine, using a combination of chemical intuition underpinned by Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) and DFT methods.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot [3 + 3] Heteroannulative&#160;Coupling of Thioamides with Epichlorohydrin: Access to Diverse 1,3&#8208;Thiazinanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally simple and efficient cascade approach to access a series of 1,3&#8208;thiazinanes has been developed via intermolecular [3+3] heteroannulative coupling employing &#946;&#8208;ketothioamide as a C1N1S1 unit and epichlorohydrin as a C3 unit at room temperature for the first time. The reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of thiocarbonyl sulfur to less hindered primary carbon of oxirane followed by sequential intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization and dehydrochlorination enabling the coupling by cleavage of C&#8722;O bond and formation of two new C&#8208;S and C&#8208;N bonds in one stretch. This protocol not only avoids potential toxicity and tedious work up procedures, but also features open atmosphere, good to high yields, gram&#8208;scalability, and easy performance from inexpensive readily available starting materials under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. A probable mechanism for the formation of 1,3&#8208;thiazinanes has been suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Chemical Structure of Cellulose Nanocrystals by Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals is presently considered a useful and straightforward tool for accessing very reliable biocompatible and biodegradable nanostructures with tailored physical and chemical properties. However, to date the fine characterization of the chemical appendages introduced onto cellulose nanocrystals remains a challenge, due to the low sensitivity displayed by the most common techniques towards surface functionalization. In this paper, we demonstrate the easy functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals with aliphatic and aromatic amines, demonstrating the tunability of their properties in dependence on the selected functionality. Then, we apply to colloidal suspensions of modified nanocrystals 1H&#8208;NMR analysis to elucidate their surface structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where such investigation was performed on cellulose nanocrystals presenting both surface and reducing end modification. These results involve interesting implications for the fields of Cultural Heritage and of Materials Chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>First Total Synthesis of the Benzotropolone/Bis(pulvinone) Natural Product Aurantricholone Exploiting New Strategies for Establishing Benzotropolones and Z&#8208;Configured Pulvinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal colorant aurantricholone was synthesized in 15&#8197;steps. Its benzotropolone core resulted from 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethoxytetral&#8208;1&#8208;one in 3&#8197;steps which included a 1&#8208;pot ring&#8208;enlargement/oxidation/acetylation sequence. A regioselective 2&#8208;step bromination allowed two Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a new tetronate building block to ensue in one go. Deprotection (2&#8197;steps) gave protonated aurantricholone or its Li or Ca salt.







Abstract
Aurantricholone as well as its calcium and lithium salts, all of which represent the coloring principle of the fungus Tricholoma aurantium, were synthesized for the first time, namely in 15&#8197;steps, 10 of which were our longest linear sequence. We developed an access to benzotropolones after dibromocyclopropanating alkyl or silyl enol ethers of 1&#8208;tetralones. Successive treatments with DMAP&#8208;N&#8208;oxide and Ac2O effected ring&#8208;enlargement, oxidation, and acetylation. O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzotropolone obtained thereby &#8211; similarly as unsubstituted benzotropolone &#8211; was brominated at C&#8208;8 in two steps by adopting our recently published bromination protocol for otherwise unsubstituted O&#8208;acetylbenzotropolone. Thereafter, a double and doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki&#8208;coupling with a newly introduced boronate established the O&#8208;methylated pulvinone moiety as well as the O&#8208;methylated &#8220;pulvinone&#8208;like&#8221; motif of what altogether equaled the completed aurantricholone scaffold. Its deprotection (two steps) furnished the title compound either as its protonated form or its calcium or lithium salt.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Sulfinate Migration Triggered by &#945;&#8208;Imino Carbene and Divergent Zwitterion Cyclization: Synthesis of Cyclopropane, Dihydropyrrole, and Azepane Ring Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three birds with one stone: A convenient divergent synthetic strategy was established by regulation on the intramolecular annulation modes of zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites, yielding various functionalized 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings.







Abstract
Cyclopropane, dihydropyrrole, and azepane ring systems were synthesized conveniently from sulfinate&#8208;tethered triazoles. The divergent synthetic strategy started with the unique 1,3&#8208;sulfinate migration of an &#945;&#8208;imino carbene. The efficient reaction allowed control of the zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites depending on the increased stability of the resulting carbocation and anion. The sulfinate was converted to a sulfone after the group migration, and a stable anion bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing groups was thus formed. Catalytic amounts of iodide acted as a switch for the synthesis of cyclopropanes and dihydropyrroles. The reaction merits including readily available substrates, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility qualified this protocol a possible synthetic tool for cyclic compounds, especially for N&#8208;heterocycles.

The Front Cover shows the formation of a new fused heterocycle derived from furanose saccharide. This reaction is possible thanks to a deoxyfunctionalisation event through an intramolecular thermal Minisci reaction. The cover image was inspired by the creatures named Susuwatari, created by Studio Ghibli for some of their films. These soot spirits emerge from fire, acting as stabilizers of the radical species, as well as mediators of the newly formed bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. G&#243;mez&#8208;Su&#225;rez et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Last Fortress of Tin's Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods used for the protodenitration of nitroalkanes were reviewed. Despite several decades of intense research, the most frequently used option remains the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing toxic tributyltin hydride. Thus, the protodenitration of nitroalkanes remains the last fortress of the tyranny of tin.







Abstract
Protodenitration, a direct reduction of nitroalkanes to corresponding alkanes, already spans two centuries and is enabled by various reagents. This mini&#8208;review provides a historical development of the fundamental transformation and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride and environmentally unpopular solvents sharply contrasting with modern ecological trends, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin's tyranny.&#8221;

         <dc:description>&#945; and &#946; anomers of an acetophenone C&#8208;nucleoside were synthesized and incorporated in the middle of short oligodeoxynucleotides. The ketone oligonucleotides were converted to 15N&#8208;labelled oxime oligonucleotides by treatment with 15N&#8208;hydroxylamine and, finally, cyclopalladated by treatment with lithium tetrachloropalladate. Comparison of the UV melting profiles of duplexes bearing the &#946; anomer of either the palladacyclic or the metal&#8208;free oxime C&#8208;nucleoside suggested formation of a stable Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pair, especially with adenine or thymine as the base pairing partner. Melting profiles of the corresponding duplexes bearing the &#945; anomer were much more convoluted, precluding meaningful comparison. 15N NMR spectra were obtained for the &#946; anomeric oxime oligonucleotide as well as its palladacyclic derivative but the signals unfortunately diminished below detection limit when the latter was hybridized with a complementary strand placing a 15N3&#8208;labelled thymine opposite to the palladacyclic residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Synthesis of Benzofuranones from ortho&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols or Benzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two flexible methods for synthesizing benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones are developed, with easily available starting materials, good chemoselectivity, and very mild conditions. One protocol for benzofuranone is a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of o&#8208;alkynyl phenol with alcohol or acid. Another metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzofuranone is the treatment of benzofuran with alcohol, acid, or H2O.







Abstract
Benzofuranones are attractive synthetic targets in medicinal and natural products. The cycloisomerization of o&#8208;alkynyl phenol to benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one is reported here using gold(I) and Selectfluor. This benzofuranone can also be obtained from benzofuran without a gold catalyst. This study presents two appealing synthetic methods for benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones that use readily available starting materials, have high chemoselectivity and operate under very mild conditions.

         <title>Detours in the Development of the Organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Vinylboronic Compounds. A Dead End?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical and experimental studies were performed to further optimize the organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of vinylboronic compounds. Although the yields and the stereoselectivities could not be improved much, a simpler procedure is described. In addition, a deeper knowledge into the reaction mechanism has been achieved, particularly on the substituent effect of the catalyst and the ligand exchange.







Abstract
Attempts to improve the organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of vinylboronic compounds are described. Further experiments, theoretical calculations and NMR studies were performed to optimize the existing procedure and analyze the reactivity of the reactive intermediate and the ligand&#8208;exchange process. In particular, the relationship between the structure and the performance of the organocatalysts was studied theoretically and experimentally. Although the catalytic activity of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids could not be improved much, a deeper insight has been gained, which might be useful for the development of other organocatalytic reactions of organoboron compounds.

         <title>Macrocyclic Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids and Silphiperfolanol Angelate Esters from Solanecio mannii</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids and a silphiperfolanol angelate ester were isolated from the Rwandan medicinal herb Solanecio mannii. The relative configuration of senaetnine was determined by NAMFIS analysis. Synthetic modification of 5 provided two new compounds, 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphiperfolane and 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphi&#8208;perfolane. Some of the compounds showed strong cytotoxicity but weak antibacterial activities.







Abstract
Three new compounds, the silphiperfolanol angelate ester umutagarananol (1), the macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids umutagarinine A and B (2&#8211;3), and five known secondary metabolites (4&#8211;8) were isolated from the CH2Cl2&#8722;MeOH (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) extract of the roots and the stem bark of Solanecio mannii (Hook. f.) (Asteraceae). The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric analyses, whereas the relative stereochemistry of 4 was established by NAMFIS&#8208;based combined computational and solution NMR analysis. Synthetic modification of 5 provided two new compounds, 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphiperfolane (9) and 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphi&#8208;perfolane (10). The crude extracts and the isolated constituents showed weak antibacterial activities (EC50 0.7&#8211;13.3&#8197;mM) against the Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and the Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis. Compounds 2, 3 and 4 exhibited strong cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 human breast cancer cells, with EC50 values of 35.6, 21.7 and 12.5&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Hydrosilylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported utilizing silanes as the hydride donor. The ruthenium complex [RuCl(PPh3)2(&#951;5&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylindenylidene))], a versatile catalyst is, for the first time, employed in this catalytic reaction. The catalyst displays high catalytic efficiency at low loading and operates under mild conditions. This catalytic approach showcases high compatibility and regioselectivity with quinolines bearing different substituents and related N&#8208; heterocyclic compounds. The mechanism of this transformation was probed by performing stoichiometric reactions and examined using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Bromination of Substituted Thiophenes in Batch and Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical bromination of substituted thiophenes and benzothiophenes from ammonium bromide was developed to produce 2&#8208;bromo thiophenes and 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes with moderate to excellent yields under both batch and continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
An electrochemical bromination of thiophenes from ammonium bromide is developed both in batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Substituted thiophenes possessing 2&#8208;hydrogens selectively afford a series of 2&#8208;bromothiophenes while 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes generate 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes. Based on the cyclic voltammetric studies and literature, a bromine cation involved mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening Addition of Activated Vinyl Cyclopropanes with N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening addition reaction of activated vinyl cyclopropanes with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones provides N&#8208;tosylhydrazone butenylmalonate compounds in good yields. Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening addition reaction of activated vinyl cyclopropanes with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones in the presence of palladium(0) and triphenylphosphine affords N&#8208;tosylhydrazone butenylmalonate compounds. Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products. The transformation relationship of the terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products in the reaction was also observed. A reasonable mechanism is proposed based on preliminary experimental results.

         <title>Allylsulfones through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two distinct protocols for the preparation of allylsulfones via Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H activation. While the former protocol consists of a direct Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the latter involves a sequential one&#8208;pot Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation.







Abstract
Two previously unknown protocols for Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H sulfonylation of terminal alkenes have been developed. While the former consists of a direct Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the latter involves a sequential one&#8208;pot Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation. The scope of both protocols was studied on 25 examples.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two previously unknown protocols for Pd-catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H sulfonylation of terminal alkenes have been developed. While the former consists of a direct Pd(II)-catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the latter involves a sequential one-pot Pd(II)-catalyzed C&#8722;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)-catalyzed sulfonylation. The scope of both protocols was studied on 25 examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxyl&#8208;Yne Click Reaction: A Powerful Tool toward Red&#8208;Emitting Nontraditional Small Organic Luminogens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction has been successfully established, which was a powerful tool for the preparation of red&#8208;emitting nontraditional small organic luminogens.







Abstract
Nontraditional small organic luminogens (NTSOLs) without classic conjugated chromophores have attracted significant attention. However, the design and synthesis of NTSOLs with fluorescence in the red region remain significantly challenging. In this study, we established a self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction for preparing long&#8208;wavelength and red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs. Owing to their perfect reaction selectivity, high efficiency, and excellent universality, a series of compounds with well&#8208;defined structures were obtained in high yields. Moreover, the obtained compounds showed concentration&#8208;enhanced and excitation&#8208;dependent emission characteristics. The compounds also exhibited dramatical chemical structure&#8208;dependent and aggregation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted fluorescence properties, based on which we successfully obtained red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs by simply adjusting chemical structure and concentration. Also, the compounds show good cell staining ability, which can be used in cell imaging.

         <title>Superbase&#8208;Catalyzed Steric&#8208;Hindrance&#8208;Induced Dimerization of Alkynones to Highly Functionalized Furans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel superbase&#8208;catalyzed dimerization pathways of widely&#8208;applicable substrates, namely alkynones, have been discovered and thoroughly studied.







Abstract
The cascade dimerization of alkynones bearing sterically hindered secondary alkyl groups at the carbonyl function has unexpectedly furnished highly functionalized furans. The reaction efficiently occurs in the presence of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide/dimethylsulfoxide superbase catalytic system at room temperature. Alkynones having additional C&#8722;H active site at the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond have followed another dimerization pathway to afford 3&#8208;alkenylpyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones. The discovery of these reactions expands the traditional knowledge about the reactivity of alkynones in strong basic medium.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaspiro Tricyclic Scaffolds through Post&#8208;Ugi Modifications: Scope and Limitation of Aza&#8208;Michael Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores efficient post&#8208;Ugi modification strategies to synthesize azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds with detailed investigation of aza&#8208;Michael cyclizations.







Abstract
Post&#8208;Ugi modifications offer a great tool to construct functionalized heterocycles in an atom&#8208;economic manner. Using this approach, we have constructed highly functionalized azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds that involve Ugi condensation and ipso&#8208;cyclization followed by aza&#8208;Michael ring closures. Herein, we present a detailed account of aza&#8208;Michael cyclizations with respect to substrate scope and limitations, along with new methods to prepare novel azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Rapid Access to Substituted Indenones through Grignard Reaction and Its Application in the Synthesis of Fluorenones Using Ring Closing Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenones are synthesized using a practical and scalable method. The addition of Grignard reagents to indene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones provides 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indenones through dehydrative aromatization. Significantly, a naturally occurring neo&#8208;lignan has been synthesised in one pot. Moreover, diallyl indenones have been utilized as ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) precursors for synthesising fluorenones through an RCM&#8208;aromatization sequence.







Abstract
An efficient, one&#8208;step method has been used to access a variety of substituted indenones in a regiospecific manner by Grignard addition to indene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione. This method provides straightforward access to natural products such as neo&#8208;lignans and isoampelopsin D analogues. Moreover, diallyl indenones have been synthesized and employed as ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) precursors for the facile synthesis of substituted fluorenone derivatives through an RCM&#8208;aromatization sequence.

         <title>Quantifying Vertical Resonance Energy in Aromatic Systems with Natural Bond Orbitals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deleting &#960;NBO&#8594;&#960;*NBO interactions for a series of benzenoids and non&#8208;benzenoid systems returns energies that correlate with existing magnetic criteria of aromaticity (NICS). Thus, aromaticity can in principle be intuitively understood through interactions between typical 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bonding orbitals. The method is used to investigate properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and non&#8208;planar systems with M&#246;bius topology.







Abstract
Natural bond orbitals (NBOs) provide the familiar Lewis type (2c&#8211;2e&#8722;) localized description of a molecule. Interactions between nearly filled (2e&#8722; &#960; or &#963;) orbitals and empty (&#960;* or &#963;*) anti&#8208;bonding orbitals represent delocalization in the system and creates a framework to study stereoelectronic interactions. Here we show that deleting the interactions (NBODel) between &#960; and &#960;* orbitals in aromatic systems and acquiring the energy with the NBO program provides a highly intuitive and quantitative picture of &#960;&#8208;aromaticity that correlates with the well&#8208;established nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) method. This natural bond orbital resonance energy (NBO&#8208;RE) measures the vertical resonance energy (VRE) of aromatic systems without the use of an external reference structure. The NBO&#8208;RE method is applicable to the study of local aromaticity in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other non&#8208;planar systems.

         <title>A Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;Type Alkenylation Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy: A Rare Example of C&#8722;C Bond Formation towards the C2&#8208;Carbon of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the olefination in ortho&#8208;position to a carboxylic acid group by employing simple olefins which do not carry electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The acid initially acts as the directing group but is subsequently removed by decarboxylation. The process introduces an alkene in meta&#8208;position to an electron donating residue, which is complementary to classical electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;type reaction of unactivated terminal alkenes and benzoic acid derivatives bearing electron donating residues under mild conditions. The acid functionality acts as a traceless directing group delivering products alkenylated in meta&#8208;position to the electron donating substituent in contrast to the usually obtained ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;substitution in Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reactions. Remarkably, the new C&#8722;C bond is formed to the C2 of the terminal olefin, in contrast to similar reported transformations. Initially formed mixtures of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;double bond isomers can be efficiently isomerized to the more stable endo&#8208;products.

     alt="A Fujiwara-Moritani-Type Alkenylation Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy: A Rare Example of C&#8722;C Bond Formation towards the C2-Carbon of Terminal Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the olefination in &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-position to a carboxylic acid group by employing simple olefins which do not carry electron-withdrawing groups. The acid initially acts as the directing group but is subsequently removed by decarboxylation. The process introduces an alkene in &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-position to an electron donating residue, which is complementary to classical electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report, a rhodium-catalyzed Fujiwara-Moritani-type reaction of unactivated terminal alkenes and benzoic acid derivatives bearing electron donating residues under mild conditions. The acid functionality acts as a traceless directing group delivering products alkenylated in &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-position to the electron donating substituent in contrast to the usually obtained &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substitution in Friedel-Crafts-type reactions. Remarkably, the new C&#8722;C bond is formed to the C2 of the terminal olefin, in contrast to similar reported transformations. Initially formed mixtures of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-double bond isomers can be efficiently isomerized to the more stable &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, interstitial nitrogen doped TiO2 nanotubes (INDTNTs) have been utilized as heterogeneous green catalysts for the synthesis of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type Knoevenagel adducts (3) and &#946;&#8208;enaminones (6). Notable advantages of the present method include its wide substrate scope, low catalyst loading, avoiding the use of hazardous bases and solvents, products do not require chromatographic purification, high yields, catalyst reusability etc. Characterization of the optimized catalyst, INDTNTs&#8208;4 has been studied by XRD, HRTEM and XPS techniques. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 3 and 6 have been evaluated. The study revealed that the colour tunability (cold white light to orange light) and the HOMO/LUMO levels depends mainly the presence of various electron donating and withdrawing groups on aromatic/heteroaromatic ring of 3 and 6. The results indicate that the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 3 and 6 could be promising materials for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilicities of Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Diazo Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;bond nucleophilic reactivities of seven cyclic &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds in dichloromethane were determined by analyzing the kinetics of their reactions with benzhydrylium ions (one&#8208;bond reference electrophiles) at 20 &#176;C according to the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation lg k2 = sN(N + E). Though not calibrated for pericyclic reactions, the identified nucleophilicities also reflect relative reactivities of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. These (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions primarily gave spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazoles, which underwent thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic (van Alphen&#8208;H&#252;ttel) rearrangements to furnish 1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;fused tricyclic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocyanation of Homostilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the pre&#173;viously unknown enantio&#173;selective Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydro&#173;cyanation of 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes (homo&#173;stilbenes). For this purpose, a series of (E)&#8208;homostilbenes were prepared by (microwave&#8208;assisted) Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of allylic alcohols with aryl&#8208;boronic acids. Employing our established catalyst system formed from Ni(cod)2 and a TADDOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphine&#8208;phosphite ligand and using TMSCN as an in&#8208;situ source of HCN, the hydrocyanation of various homostilbenes was studied. Despite the competing regio&#8208;isomerization due to chain&#8208;walking of the nickel hydride intermediates, the reactions usually proceeded efficiently (up to 92% yield) and with useful levels of regio&#8208;retention (typically &gt;75:25 r.r.) and enantioselectivities of up to 88:12 e.r.. Both donor (OMe, OH) and acceptor (CN) substituents at the aryl rings were tolerated. The synthetic usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated in a short synthesis of the new (allo&#8208;) colchicine analogue 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;11&#8208;methoxy&#8208;colchinol involving an PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative cyclization of the corresponding hydrocyanation product to set up the 7&#8208;membered ring. The absolute configuration of 2,4&#8208;diphenylbutyronitrile was assigned by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Monoxide Release and Capture: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermolysis of thiirane oxide leads to production of highly reactive sulfur monoxide. The liberated SO can in turn be trapped with a diene scavenger forming dihydrothiophene oxide. Since the intermediate diatomic possesses a triplet ground state, the SO transfer can proceed on two spin&#8208;state surfaces. Here, we study the competition between singlet concerted and stepwise triplet diradical mechanisms utilizing the M06&#8208;2X density functional as well as CCSD(T) and MRCI+Q wavefunction theories. We find that the decomposition of thiirane oxide prefers to pass through a triplet diradical intermediate that becomes accessible from a nearby minimum energy crossing point (MECP). Hence, the thermolysis of thiirane oxide is expected to predominantly release triplet ground state sulfur monoxide in agreement with previous experimental reports. The addition of 3SO to 1,3&#8208;butadiene initially generates an allylic diradical, that ring&#8208;closes to a thiirane oxide through another MECP, and a subsequent rearrangement gives access to the final product.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Transformation of Azepino[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indoles en Route to Nature&#8208;Inspired Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azepino[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indole derivatives represent the core scaffold of important natural products and biologically significant compounds. Therefore, the establishment of step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic strategies to access this class of compounds is of paramount importance. To this end, complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity (CtD) strategy has become one of the most important tools that transforms complex molecules into diverse skeleta. However, many of the reactions that could be employed in CtD are restricted by the functional handles exist in these molecules. This limits the achievement of the desired skeletal diversity. Herein, an efficient and step&#8208;economic strategy to access a diverse collection of azepino&#8208;[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indole architectures via a cascade that unites Pictet&#8208;Spengler with Michael addition, is described. This was achieved by reacting cyclohexadienone acetaldehydes 2a&#8208;2d with indolyl&#8208;4&#8208;ethyl amine 1. Employing a CtD strategy on the developed azepino&#8208;[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indoles, a rapid rearrangement reaction that provided a modular, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective access to diverse collection of spiro azepinocarbazole nature&#8208;inspired frameworks, was encountered.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Access to 2&#8208;Arylbenzo[b]tellurophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective method for the preparation of benzo[b]tellurophenes has been developed: overnight heating of o&#8208;haloarylalkynes with Te&#8208;NaOH&#8208;DMSO triad without the need for dry and inert atmosphere provides the corresponding benzo[b]tellurophenes.







Abstract
Arguably, the simplest way for the preparation of benzo[b]tellurophenes has been elaborated. Cyclization of o&#8208;haloarylalkynes in the presence of Te&#8208;NaOH&#8208;DMSO triad occurs by simple mixing of starting materials and heating overnight without the need for dry and inert atmosphere and provides the corresponding benzo[b]tellurophenes in up to 90&#8201;% GC&#8208;yield. Catalytic telluration of aryl iodide substrates extends the applicability of the developed cyclization cascade to substrates that are not suitable for the direct SNAr/5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization approach. Successful SEAr in the third position of benzo[b]tellurophene provides a synthetic intermediate for the preparation of Te analogues of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene.

         <title>HFO&#8208;1234yf as a CF3 building block: synthesis of trifluoromethyl quinoline and chromene derivatives from trifluoromethyl&#8208;ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl ynones derived from the refrigerant gas HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene) react with nucleophiles via a Michael&#8208;type addition process and the allenoate intermediate formed reacts intramolecularly with a carbonyl group to form heterocyclic derivatives. Thus, reaction of 2&#8208;amino and 2&#8208;hydroxyl benzaldehyde or ketone substrates with trifluoromethyl ynone derivatives gives trifluoromethyl quinoline and chromene products by a one&#8208;pot tandem ring closing sequence, forming pharmaceutically relevant structures from an inexpensive starting material without the need for transition metals or column chromatography. The 2&#8208;trifluoromethylquinoline products also show unusual fluxional behaviour, which was explored through 2&#8208;D NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cis&#8208;Fused Tricyclic System Through Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Epoxidation, and Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis: Access to Basic Core of Presilphiperfolanols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a new synthetic approach to a highly strained 1,3&#8208;fused cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic system that appeared among the presilphiperfolanol analogues. The cis&#8208;fusion of six&#8208;membered ring to a diquinane moiety is accomplished by substrate&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselective epoxidation, and ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) sequence. In this regard, both early&#8208;, and late&#8208;stage epoxidation and RRM reactions were studied. The target compound, cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic ketone with an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;oxirane ring can serve as a key building block to produce various presilphiperfolanol analogues. The cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6&#8208;tricyclic&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone can also act as masked enone and therefore useful for various chemical transformations in organic synthesis. The short synthetic sequence disclosed here may be useful to design various biologically important molecules. The newly reported molecules are well&#8208;characterized by NMR, HRMS, and IR spectral data.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Studies of Thermoresponsive Copper (I) Complex towards Click Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reaction or copper&#8208;assisted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can conveniently synthesize desired organic molecules or functionalize biological macromolecules. In many cases, trace amounts of residual copper from the reaction mixture are not trivial to remove when the exhaustive purification step is avoided to fulfill the essential criteria of a click reaction. It is often detrimental, particularly for biochemical applications or when it involves biological macromolecules. Herein, we have reported the synthesis of a new type of copper (I) complex as a smart catalyst for click reaction, which can be separated from the reaction mixture very easily by the slight elevation of temperature, thanks to its thermoresponsive behavior. The click reactions using a thermoresponsive catalyst were first studied in an aqueous medium using various organic molecules containing alkyne and azide functional groups. Later, the strategy was extended to biological macromolecules like collagen.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bifunctional Lipoxin&#8208;Derived Enzyme&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules (LipET&#8208;CORMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the development of new anti&#8208;inflammatory agents which act by co&#8208;release of carbon monoxide (CO) and a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, we designed conjugates of a lipoxin A4 analogue and an acyloxycyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complex as an esterase&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM). Two of such compounds were successfully prepared by total synthesis (12 steps; 4&#8208;5% yield) starting from deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribose and exploiting a Wittig olefination and a&#160;Heck reaction as key C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming steps. Reduction of an aryl&#8208;ketone in the presence of a sensitive dienol ester functionality was achieved by NaBH4&#8208;catalyzed&#160;reaction with borane. Both target compounds were dose&#8208;dependently toxic towards cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) in HUVEC was observed for both compounds, they did not inhibit TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;mediated VCAM&#8208;1 expression in these cells. In M2 polarized macrophages HO&#8208;1 expression was more pronounced as compared to M1 polarized macrophages. In both cells HO&#8208;1 expression was downregulated by lipopolysaccharide, but only in M2 macrophages HO&#8208;1 expression was rescued by LipET&#8208;CORM. 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase (15&#8208;LO) was only expressed in M2 macrophages and was not influenced by LipET&#8208;CORM. Collectively our data demonstrate that LipET&#8208;CORMs induce HO&#8208;1 expression in endothelial cells and M2 polarized macrophages. The role of the intra&#8208;cellular released lipoxin A4 in resolution of inflammation, however, remains to be assessed.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aiming at the development of new anti-inflammatory agents which act by co-release of carbon monoxide (CO) and a specialized pro-resolving mediator, we designed conjugates of a lipoxin A4 analogue and an acyloxycyclohexadiene-Fe(CO)3 complex as an esterase-triggered CO-releasing molecule (ET-CORM). Two of such compounds were successfully prepared by total synthesis (12 steps; 4-5% yield) starting from deoxy-d-ribose and exploiting a Wittig olefination and a&#160;Heck reaction as key C-C bond-forming steps. Reduction of an aryl-ketone in the presence of a sensitive dienol ester functionality was achieved by NaBH4-catalyzed&#160;reaction with borane. Both target compounds were dose-dependently toxic towards cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in HUVEC was observed for both compounds, they did not inhibit TNF-&#945;-mediated VCAM-1 expression in these cells. In M2 polarized macrophages HO-1 expression was more pronounced as compared to M1 polarized macrophages. In both cells HO-1 expression was downregulated by lipopolysaccharide, but only in M2 macrophages HO-1 expression was rescued by LipET-CORM. 15-Lipoxygenase (15-LO) was only expressed in M2 macrophages and was not influenced by LipET-CORM. Collectively our data demonstrate that LipET-CORMs induce HO-1 expression in endothelial cells and M2 polarized macrophages. The role of the intra-cellular released lipoxin A4 in resolution of inflammation, however, remains to be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Mediated Sulfur Extrusion of Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes can be used to substitute the highly carcinogenic aminophosphines to extrude sulfur from disulfides from thioethers (here R=aryl). Furthermore, pharmaceutically more interesting compounds such as cystine can be transformed to lanthionine.







Abstract
The sulfur extrusion from organic disulfides is a highly useful reaction recognised for the first time over 40&#8197;years ago. Unfortunately, it is mainly performed by aminophosphines, such as hexamethylphosphorus triamine, which is known to be very carcinogenic. This limits the application of the extrusion reaction especially for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products. We have developed a new method, using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), generated from the corresponding stable imidazolium salts in combination with a base to transform a broad scope of benzylic disulfides to thioethers. In addition disulfide containing esters as well as cystine undergo this reaction.

         <title>tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 System Induced C&#8208;2 Functionalization of 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amides with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type C2&#8722;H functionalization approach including acylation and alkylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. The chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation from alcohols, and the mechanism for the acylation reaction was investigated in detail.







Abstract
A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type acylation approach of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. Simultaneously, the C2&#8722;H alkylation can be realized by accident for special benzyl alcohols bearing strong electron&#8208;donating groups. Most N&#8208;heterocycles were also compatible to afford corresponding acylated products. Furthermore, the mechanism investigation reveals that chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation through abstracting the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H from the alcohols, then underwent nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals addition, deprotonation, and oxidation to provide the target acylation products.

Synthesis of 4&#8208;alkenylated pyrazolinones derivatives by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes with pyrazolinones. The methodology has the advantages of metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, high atom economy, and mild condition.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diarylpropenes firstly serve as efficient alkenylated reagents for the functionalization of pyrazolinones. In the presence of 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), it undergoes oxidative coupling and final dehydrogenation to give the highly substituted E,E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;dienpyrazolinones in moderate to excellent yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure is employed to synthesize both symmetrical and unsymmetrical urea by using a mild carbonyl source CDI, and Zn metal. This established approach is appropriate for all types of amines. We synthesized the FDA&#8208;approved Cariprazine drug molecule using this method.

         <title>Progress in (Thio)urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Based Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysts with Multiple H&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays chiral (thio)urea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based Br&#248;nsted base catalysts are widely applied to enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. In recent years, variations of these catalysts that incorporate and additional H&#8208;bond donor unit (green remark) have been shown to perform often superior in terms of activity and stereoselectivity. This Review covers aspects on these catalysts design and their applications.







Abstract
Thiourea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based bifunctional base catalysts represent nowadays a powerful tool in the field of asymmetric catalysis and have demonstrated very efficient for promoting a wide variety of transformations enantioselectively. New versions that incorporate one or various additional H&#8208;bond donor site(s) in the catalyst structure have been developed recently which led to more active (reduced catalyst loadings) and selective catalysts. This review highlights the pioneering ideas and the most recent contributions to the area with the material organized according to the nature of the additional H&#8208;bond donor functionality. The advantages, current limitations and perspectives of these new multifunctional catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of [60]Fullerene Hybrids Endowed with Steroids and Monosaccharides: Theoretical Underpinning as Promising anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New [60]fullerene hybrids endowed with steroid and monosaccharide moieties are obtained through a cyclopropanation reaction. The structure of monoadducts were determined by spectroscopic and analytical study. Theoretical calculations predicted the most stable conformations and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. The molecular docking studies suggested the possible application of these compounds as anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
Cyclopropanation reactions between C60 and different malonates decorated with monosaccharides and steroids using the Bingel&#8208;Hirsch methodology have allowed the obtention of a new family of hybrid compounds in good yields. A complete set of instrumental techniques has allowed us to fully characterize the hybrid derivatives and to determine the chemical structure of monocycloadducts. Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel&#8208;type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT&#8208;D3(BJ)/PBE 6&#8208;311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent&#8208;accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Annulation of Alkynoic Acids with Unactivated Alkenes in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and green NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones is accomplished. In the presence of 0.5&#8197;mol% of IPr&#8722;Pd&#8722;Py&#8722;Cl2 in [Amim]Cl, both the alkynoic acids and unactivated alkenes were well tolerated, thus giving the desired products in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquids is described. This protocol enables facile access for the preparation of diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity. Moreover, the ionic liquid not only acts as the green solvent, but also as the eco&#8208;friendly chlorine source, thus avoiding the use of excess metal halides such as cupric chloride. Some preliminary mechanistic studies were performed, which further revealed possible pathways for this cascade annulation.

Nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes when heated with pyrazoles in DMSO give oxoamination products through tandem Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with pyrazoles in DMSO was investigated. Unexpectedly, the cyclopropanes underwent Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation with DMSO to form aroylmethylidene malonates as intermediates in the reactions. The intermediates further underwent aza&#8208;Michael addition with pyrazoles in tandem manner to give the corresponding aza&#8208;Michael adducts. The highlights of the methodology include the occurrence of ring&#8208;opening/oxidation under neutral conditions with DMSO and formation of aza&#8208;Michael adducts with pyrazoles under catalyst&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Flavin&#8208;Indole Conjugates with Rigid Diamino Linkers as Cryptochrome Model Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise reductive aminations of aldehydes derived from indole and flavin with rigid 1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and 2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;trans&#8208;decalin linkers furnished two model compounds for avian cryptochromes. Radical pair formation by light&#8208;induced electron&#8208;transfer in such dyads was proposed to show a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent quantum effect.







Abstract
The synthesis of flavin&#8208;indole conjugates with a trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and a 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene linker is reported. Both compounds should serve as artificial model compounds for natural cryptochrome. It is assumed that cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins located in the retina show a light&#8208;dependent quantum effect which enables migratory birds to perceive the Earth's magnetic field and is thus used for navigation. Both model compounds were prepared by stepwise reductive aminations of indole carbaldehyde and a flavin&#8208;substituted acetaldehyde with the appropriate diamine linkers. The hitherto unknown 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene was prepared in four steps from 2,6&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene as the achiral (meso) ax,ax,trans&#8208;diastereoisomer. The configuration of this key intermediate as well as synthetic precursors has been established by a series of X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses.

         <dc:description>
Two insect pheromones with &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety were accessed from a cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester. The key step is the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation yielding the &#948;&#8208;lactone unit.







Abstract
The cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;lactones with exocyclic ester moiety is the key transformation for the preparation of racemic 5&#8208;hexadecanolide (15&#8201;% over nine steps) and 6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide (22&#8201;% over eight steps), two insect pheromones. The benzyloxycarbonyl moiety is transformed via the acid chloride to the undecanoyl side chain. After reduction of the ketone to the secondary alcohol, this functional group was either reduced via the chloro compound to furnish the 5&#8208;hexadecanolide. On the other hand, stereoselective reduction of the ketone gave secondary alcohol with the wrong relative configuration, which was established by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure. Inversion was achieved by reaction of the methanesulfonate with cesium acetate yielding (R*,S*)&#8208;6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide with the relative configuration also present in the natural product.

         <title>New advances in the synthesis of emerging cyclic amidrazones to foster bioisosterism of azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pace and the scope of new molecules design is often constrained by limitations in synthetic chemistry. The azaheterocyclic amidrazones are of particular interest for bioisosteric considerations in drug discovery. However, the lack of efficient synthetic access has undoubtedly hampered their occurrence in the drug chemical space. Our current results describe a robust synthetic access relying on cyclization of aminohydrazine in presence of various orthoesters by either metal free&#8208; or metal&#8208;catalyzed condensations. This optimized synthetic access to cyclic amidrazones as original scaffold should inspire the chemist community and further drive innovation in the design of molecular structure for many applications (drug, materials, dyes&#8230;).</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;Acylative Vinylation of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxane Towards Rotaxane Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acylation of cyclodextrin&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was implemented with anhydride reagents following a facile procedure. Methacrylic anhydride facilitated the introduction of the vinyl&#8208;group into the rotaxane structure toward achieving a crosslinker. Interestingly, only a few methacrylic units were attached to the cyclodextrin at reaction temperatures of up to 60 &#176;C even with an excess amount of the reagent, probably due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the number of vinyl groups on the [3]rotaxane framework was easily controlled to be approximately two units via a simple random acylation, which worked effectively as a facile synthesis route for the rotaxane crosslinker. The acylation behavior was investigated in detail by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analyses. The vinylated [3]rotaxane was successfully used as a crosslinker to obtain a rotaxane&#8208;crosslinked polymer. The proposed approach will help overcome the trade&#8208;off between convenience and utility associated with the mono&#8208; modification of cyclodextrin.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ortho&#8208;Quinols are chiral 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives of interest to organic chemists because of their natural occurrence, their role as intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse natural products, and the versatility of their chemical reactivity. Readily accessible from dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenols or other arenols, ortho&#8208;quinols constitute useful molecular entities from which structural complexity can be rapidly built, as highlighted herein through many examples of targeted syntheses of natural products, such as trichodimerol.







Abstract
6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70&#8197;years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Emissive Fluorophores Based on Multiply Stacked Anthracene Arrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Newly designed fluorophore systems with feather&#8208;like structures were constructed by connecting bisanthracene building units via a concise reaction sequence of bromination, etherification, and desilylation. Spectroscopic characterizations revealed that all of the fluorophore systems achieved high light absorptivity and high emission efficiency by preventing closely spaced anthracene chromophores from mutual interactions to reduce concomitant energy loss by fluorescence quenching. The application of fluorophore systems for the preparation of light&#8208;harvesting dyad materials has successfully demonstrated their potential utility as versatile photofunctional tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodebromination of Aryl Bromides with Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen source is reported. The application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology.







Abstract
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen sources is reported. Importantly, the application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology. The use of 6&#8208;phenyl substituted triazine&#8208;based PiprN5Pipr manganese pincer catalyst allows for the debromination of various aryl bromides with good yields. Notably, the process also occurs with bromides derived from several classes of natural products and bioactive compounds, such as citronellol, diacetone fructose, cholesterol, and vitamin E.

         <title>Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you need to know about Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and its successful implementation in the lab. Based on recent literature the most frequently used olefination methodologies have been reviewed focusing on the key parameters beneficially influencing the reaction outcome. Typically used Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagent synthesis protocols as well as the development of modified reagents are also highlighted.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination has become one of the most powerful and reliable C=C double&#8208;bond construction methods typically furnishing E&#8208;configured alkenes. This review summarizes the scientific literature of the past decade focusing on the key aspects for successful execution of the olefination step. The main stereoselectivity and yield&#8208;determining aspects have been outlined in separate chapters providing all the necessary information for the synthesis of Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagents as well as the most commonly used reaction optimization techniques.

The main stereoselectivity and yield-determining aspects have been outlined in separate chapters providing all the necessary information for the synthesis of Julia-Kocienski reagents as well as the most commonly used reaction optimization techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Pulvinic Acids Including Xerocomic Acid and Fluorescence Properties of Bis&#8208;lactone Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six pulvinic acids (pulvinic, pinastric, atromentic, xerocomic, isoxerocomic, variegatic) and a polyporic acid (atromentin) were synthesised. A set of terphenyl&#8208;quinones was prepared through sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings. Then, a rearrangement into pulvinic bis&#8208;lactones was induced by the action of Ac2O/DMSO. Ring openings and deprotections achieved total syntheses. Fluorescence properties of bis&#8208;lactones were determined.







Abstract
A set of representative pulvinic acids were synthesised using a bioinspired strategy. Terphenyl&#8208;quinones (polyporic acid scaffold) were prepared via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings allowing access to unsymmetrically substituted derivatives in a one&#8208;pot protocol. Subjected to the action of acetic anhydride and DMSO, quinones were converted into bis&#8208;lactone intermediates. Methanolysis and deprotection achieved the total syntheses of the corresponding pulvinic acids. Following this general strategy, symmetrical pulvinic, atromentic, variegatic acids and unsymmetrical congener pinastric, iso&#8208;pinastric, xerocomic and iso&#8208;xerocomic acids were prepared in fair yields. Fluorescence properties were observed for the bis&#8208;lactone intermediates and, as a complement to this synthetic work, optical properties were measured, and fluorescence quantum yields were determined for the bis&#8208;lactone pigments.

         <title>Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last few years, Katritzky salts emerged as a potential tool for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides. In this review, we summarized the applications of deaminative functionalization in the peptide chemistry field, including cross&#8208;coupling, photocatalysis, &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and macrocyclization. Moreover, findings confirmed the on&#8208;resin feasibility of using Katritzky salts in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptide drug discovery often benefits from the large structural diversity permitted by unnatural amino acids (UAAs). Indeed, numerous approved peptide drugs include UAAs in their sequences. Therefore, innovative chemical approaches either to synthesize UAAs or to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides are emerging themes in peptide drug discovery. Thanks to the recent advances in deaminative strategies using alkylpyridiniums salts, often referred to as Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed. In recent years the use of Katritzky salts have become popular in peptide chemistry due to their ease of preparation from a primary amine, which is a predominant functional group in amino acids. This review highlights the progress that has been made by using Katritzky salts in the synthesis of UAAs, late&#8208;stage peptide functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization.

         <dc:description>In the last decades, various efforts have been made to synthesize optimal glycotripods for targeting trimeric glycoproteins like asialoglycoprotein receptor, hemagglutinin, and langerin. All these trimeric glycoproteins have sugar binding pockets which are highly selective for a particular carbohydrate ligand.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder/Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiophenols provides access to thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. To illuminate its mechanism, control experiments, NMR studies and DFT computations were conducted. In particular the arrangement of the diene and dienophile in the IEDDA step was investigated, as it determines the enantioselectivity of this method.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA)/thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions: Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions: two interactions of today's research in anion recognition supramolecular chemistry. The combination of these two interactions gives rise to interesting cooperativity effects that remain difficult to rationalize and quantify. In this Review, concepts of cooperativity are illustrated by reporting examples of combination of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Anion recognition represents an active area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing for a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This Review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2-(bromomethyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;-elimination observed with &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;-hexafluoroleucine and their N-Fmoc or N-Boc derivatives in good overall yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
