         <title>Radical Thiocyano(Selenocyano)trifluoromethylations of Alkenes on Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Trifluoromethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes provides a step&#8208;economical route to CF3&#8208;containing polyfunctionalized organics. New and scalable process is highly desired in this field. Here, we report a simple and environmentally benign method for olefinic thiocyanotrifluoromethylation. By the use of PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. All tested reactions are compatible with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes and with high functional group tolerance. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. Therefore, a sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in green way.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Trifluoromethylation-based difunctionalization of alkenes provides a step-economical route to CF3-containing polyfunctionalized organics. New and scalable process is highly desired in this field. Here, we report a simple and environmentally benign method for olefinic thiocyanotrifluoromethylation. By the use of PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S-nucleophile. All tested reactions are compatible with mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-substituted alkenes and with high functional group tolerance. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. Therefore, a sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;-trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in green way.

         <title>Photoinduced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Cyclic Enones and 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazoles: An Unprecedented Pathway to Polysubstituted Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the syntheses of original pyrazolines and pyrazoles through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic enones with 2,5&#8208;disubstituted nitrile imines achieved via photochemical activation of 2,5&#8208;diaryl substituted tetrazoles. Monitoring of the reactions, similar to nitrile imine&#8208;mediated tetrazole&#8208;ene cycloadditions (NITEC), could be performed by means of UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission measurements. The presence or absence of substituents in the alpha position of the ketone function makes it possible to direct these reactions towards the selective formation of pyrazoles or pyrazolines. The choice of the cyclic enones and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazoles proved crucial for the fluorescence properties of the polycyclic derivatives obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Lithium Zincate&#8208;Mediated I/Zn Exchange Revisited: A Computational Micro&#8208;Solvation Approach in THF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium trialkylzincate&#8208;mediated I/Zn exchange reaction has been revisited computationally through a micro&#8208;solvation approach. A never yet investigated iodoaryl derivative bearing a potential bulky para&#8208;directing group, namely 4&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate, was considered as a substrate. THF as typical solvent and Et3ZnLi have also been considered for the first time in such a reaction. Three mechanistic pathways have been calculated, including (1) a literature&#8208;inspired pathway with full preservation of the synergic character of the reagent as well as a complementary mesylate group&#8208;directed pathway, (2) a THF&#8208;solvated open complex&#8208;promoted pathway and (3) an anionic pathway. While the anionic pathway appeared to be unlikely, pathway involving a THF&#8208;solvated open zincate complex turned out to be the most energetically favoured. Equivalent thermodynamic profiles were found for both complementary pathways with preservation of the synergic character of the reagent, albeit a slight preference could be attributed to that occurring with initial chelation of Li to the mesylate group (OMs) through micro&#8208;solvation approach. The I/Zn exchange was shown to proceed through a lithium&#8208;assisted aryl shuttle&#8208;like process. The iodoaryl substrate is first converted into ArLi intermediate which in turns reacts with the remaining diorganozinc reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Sulfonium Salts as Aryl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advancements in synthetic applications involving aryl radicals, utilizing aryl sulfonium salts as precursors. This topic, while challenging, holds paramount significance for drug design and the agrochemical industry. The mechanisms underlying these transformations are also discussed.







Abstract
The utilization of aryl radicals as open&#8208;shelled intermediates has become an essential tool for both conventional and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic chemistry. However, the current methods for generating aryl radicals are still inefficient, greatly impeding their practical applications. Encouragingly, sulfonium salts have emerged as appealing sources of aryl radicals for a wide range of transformations aimed at creating novel chemical bonds driven by their distinctive structural attributes and chemical tendencies. This review primarily focuses on the specific reaction mechanisms underlying the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in sulfonium salts, leading to the generation of corresponding aryl radicals within diverse reaction conditions.

         <title>Organometallic Reagents: Efficient Tools for the Synthesis of Fused Pyridinyl&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a one pot synthesis of fused substituted heteroaryl&#8208;lactones involving a Metal/Halogen Exchange reaction as key step, the reactivity of various mono&#8208; or bimetallic reagents (organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes) was explored to aim high chemoselectivity and efficiency starting from sensitive substrates.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot route to a wide range of 3&#8208;substituted fused pyridinyl&#8208;lactones, so called aza&#8208;phthalides. The developed strategy involves a Metal/Halogen Exchange (MHE) reaction as key step, followed by an electrophile trapping using various carbonyl derivatives and a subsequent lactonization. To promote the MHE reaction with high chemoselectivity, our investigations have particularly focused on the nature of mono&#8208; or bimetallic derivatives as metalation reagents including organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes, and highlighted the positive salt effect on reactional sequence. An extension to fused heteroaryl&#8208;lactones (benzothienyl&#8208;, benzofuranyl&#8208; and naphthofuranyl scaffolds) was explored.

Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing alkynes, are important starting materials and intermediates in organic reactions. Some of sulfur&#8208;containing alkynes display interesting bioactivities and are potentially applied as drugs. Various synthetic methodologies towards sulfur&#8208;containing alkynes have been developed, including C(sp)&#8722;S coupling, thiolation, S&#8208;alkynylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, etc. In this review, the approaches towards alkynyl sulfides in recent 3&#8197;years, as well as to form alkynyl trifluoromethyl sulfides and alkynylthiocyanates were highlighted. Firstly, the property and application of alkynes were introduced. After presenting the superiority of sulfur&#8208;containing alkynes, their synthetic methods were classified and presented in details. According to different kinds of sulfur&#8208;containing alkynes, synthetic methodologies for alkynyl sulfides, alkynyl trifluoromethyl sulfides and alkynylthiocyanates were summarized and the proposed reaction mechanisms were demonstrated if available.

         <dc:description>Starting from the easily prepared 1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208; or 1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearer of different substituents (cyclohexyl, phenyl, pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) in the position 2, the corresponding primary pyridinic ethanamines have been synthesized in very high enantiomeric excesses (ee &#8805; 97%). The strategy involves a highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED) catalyzed reduction, mesylation of the resulting optically active alcohol followed by nucleophilic substitution with azide anion and, finally, reduction of the azide function. Some of these pyridinic amines obtained in such manner are precursors of biologically active compounds such as Ontazolast.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Guided by Stereoelectronic Effects in Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Amides and Amines to Alkoxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and product studies on hydrogen atom transfer from the benzylic C&#8722;H bonds of amides and amines to tert&#8208;alkoxyl radicals highlight the important role played by steric and stereoelectronic effects in these reactions. Structural factors that enforce orbital overlap lead to rate accelerations that can exceed 2&#8208;orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Kinetic and product studies on the reactions of tert&#8208;alkoxyl radicals with secondary and tertiary alkanamides bearing benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds, isoindoline, tetrahydroisoquinoline and the corresponding N&#8208;acetyl derivatives were carried out. Product studies on the reactions with the tert&#8208;butoxyl radical (tBuO&#8901;) point toward exclusive HAT from the benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. Comparison of the kH values measured for reaction with the cumyloxyl radical (CumO&#8901;) with those obtained previously for the corresponding reactions of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and N,N&#8208;dialkylalkanamides, are indicative of a lack of benzylic activation and the operation of steric and stereoelectronic effects. Compared to N&#8208;methyl and N&#8208;ethyl groups, the presence of N&#8208;benzyl groups increases the barrier required to reach the optimal conformation for HAT, where the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond to be cleaved is perpendicular to the plane of the amide, precluding concurrent overlap with the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. When the benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds are in a conformation that allows for optimal overlap with both the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system and the amide &#960;&#8208;system or amine nitrogen lone pair, as in the isoindoline and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, increases in kH that exceed 2&#8208;orders of magnitude were observed, highlighting the strong contribution provided by stereoelectronic activation to these HAT processes.

         <title>Plus&#8208;Size DiPAMP Hybrids for Advanced Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation: The 2RBigFUS Model</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose hydrogenation catalysts, endowed with a top&#8208;performance under economical conditions, is the outcome of Knowles&#8217; DiPAMP evolved version. Bulky rather than super&#8208;thin Ligand models seem to fit better for a broader scope of Rh(I)&#8208;L catalysis. Application to enantiomeric &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino acids, &#945;&#8208;arylpropionic acids, &#946;&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, methylsuccinic acid, and derivatives, is showcased.







Abstract
Outfitting the P,P&#8242;&#8208;distereogenic 2MeBigFUS ligand with the characteristic branched/functionalized&#8208;alkoxy feature of the R&#8208;SMS&#8208;Phos design furnished the 2RBigFUS family (Figure&#8197;2). Rhodium(I) complexes thereof exhibited a further boosted activity and superior enantioselectivity in the hydrogenation of various functionalized olefins, including the challenging &#945;&#8208;arylacrylic acids. The application under practical conditions to enantiomeric active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and relevant synthetic building blocks capped the outcome.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Bicalutamide by Regioselective Hydroxysulfonylation of Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of anticancer drug bicalutamide promoted by visible light in one step from the corresponding N&#8208;arylacrylamide is described. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot hydroxysulfonylation reaction through a photocatalytic redox process. The use of Na2Eosin Y as photocatalyst and blue light allows the access to a broad range of &#945;&#8208;hydroxysulfonylamides bearing a quaternary center in moderate to good yields with complete regioselectivity through radical process.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free [3+2] Cycloaddition of Isoquinolinium/Pyridinium Ylides and Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and operationally simple one&#8208;pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using NaBH3CN as reductant has been developed. A series of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;a]indolizines were synthesized in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20/1 dr).







Abstract
The development of simple&#8208;to&#8208;operate methods for the preparation of indolizidine derivatives are of great importance. A mild one&#8208;pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using NaBH3CN as reductant has been developed. The protocol has a broad substrate scope (more than 40 examples) and provides various novel hexahydroindolizidine derivatives in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20/1).

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Nitrogen Heterocycles Mediated by a Redox Active Protecting Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy to efficiently access functionalized azaheterocycles starting from one equivalent of an heterocyclic precursor incorporating a redox active benzamide protecting group. Activation of the protecting group triggered an intramolecular 1,5&#8208;HAT leading to &#945;&#8208;aminoradical intermediates that were engaged in Giese additions or radical cross couplings to respectively afford alkylated or arylated products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the C&#8722;H functionalization of saturated azaheterocycles under mild conditions with only one equivalent of starting material. Our strategy is based on a redox active benzamide protecting group that is activated via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process to trigger the formation of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical. This nucleophilic radical intermediate was then engaged in Giese additions and radical cross couplings to afford C&#8722;H alkylated and arylated products.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Al3+ Based on Calix[4]arene Containing Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Derived Schiff Base</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized by functionalizing the upper edge of calix[4]arenes with salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived Schiff&#8208;bases. This probe could recognize Al3+ with high selectivity and &#8220;on&#8221; fluorescence response.







Abstract
Two novel fluorescent probes L1 and L2 for recognizing Al3+ have been prepared by cooperating salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived Schiff base groups onto the upper rim of the calix[4]arene. Of these probes, L2 is the most effective at recognizing Al3+, displaying a highly selective fluorescence &#8220;on&#8221; response with an emission wavelength at 478&#8197;nm and a Stokes shift of 88&#8197;nm. Additionally, probe L2 can form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 coordination complex with Al3+ with a binding constant of 2.6&#215;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1. Furthermore, its fluorescence intensity exhibits a good linear relationship with Al3+ concentration within the range of 2.0&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;M to 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;M, and the probe has a low detection limit of 4.36&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M.

         <title>Synthesis of Indenes via Graphene Oxide Mediated Manipulation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocatalysis expands its applicability to the synthesis of indenes via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts like alkylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hilman alcohols. Graphene oxide (GO) dictated the conditions to document a C&#8722;C bond forming protocol featuring large scope (14 examples) and moderate to high yield (45&#8208;80&#8201;%) under mild reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigation completed the present study.







Abstract
A new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach to functionalized indenes is documented. The use of commercially available graphene oxide (GO) allowed the direct access to indenyl cores (yield up to 80&#8201;%) via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type allylic alkylations with readily available Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman alcohols. Combined experimental and spectroscopic investigations contributed to shed light on the reaction mechanism dealing with a nanostructured carbon material&#8208;based C&#8722;C bond forming reaction.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of functionalized 3&#8208;(S)&#8208;arylthioindoles was achieved from indoles and aryl thiols. The coupling reaction was performed in water in the presence of K2S2O8 and glucose at room temperature.







Abstract
An efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method has been developed for the preparation of functionalized 3&#8208;(S)&#8208;arylthioindoles in good to excellent yields from indoles and aryl thiols in water. The coupling reaction was prompted by K2S2O8 in the presence of glucose at room temperature. Broad substrate scope, functional group tolerance, room temperature reactions and metal&#8208;free conditions are the salient features of the developed methodology.

         <title>HBTU Mediated Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams from E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

The direct transformation of N&#8208;protected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams through in&#8197;situ activation of carboxylic acid using the peptide coupling agent HBTU in the presence of base DIPEA is reported. The transformation involves the trans to cis isomerization of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds.







Abstract
The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams have been found in many biologically active peptide natural products. Due to their biological activities, extensive efforts have been made in the literature to synthesize the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Here, we are reporting the spontaneous transformation of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam through in&#8208;situ activation of free carboxylic acid using peptide coupling reagent HBTU and base DIPEA at room temperature. The transformation also involves the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The reaction is also compatible with the peptides consisting of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids at the C&#8208;terminus. The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams were isolated in very good yields. Even though the reaction required very mild conditions, the products were isolated in the form of a racemic mixture. However, the products can be separated under a chiral environment. No &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams were observed if the reaction was performed in the presence of free amines. In addition, no racemization was observed during the peptide synthesis. The analysis of the reactions of various substrates revealed that amide NH and &#947;&#8208;CH are important for lactamization. No &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams or E&#8594;Z isomerization products were observed in the case of N&#8208;Me&#8208;(E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids, whereas in the case of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dimethyl amino acid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam was isolated, however, with low yield.

The combination of two green chemical domains: an efficient and sustainable method for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura mechanochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction with NaDES as LAG additive. The synthesis process is fast and does not require ligand or heating.







Abstract
The use of volatile solvents for organic synthesis is nowadays questioned due to their negative impact on the environnement. To develop sustainable and environmentally friendly methodologies, we propose to combine two green chemistry concepts: the use of bioinspired solvents: natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES), and mechanochemistry. Using the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling as a model reaction, we described an efficient mechanochemical method with NaDES as a LAG (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding) additive with short reaction times and without any ligand or additional heating. A mechanochemical extraction was also used to reduce the amounts of extraction solvents and the total time of the synthesis process.

         <title>Amination of Isonitriles in Water: Urea Synthesis under Biocompatible Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed here. Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells, which may be used to diagnose proteins with abnormal expression in their native habitats. The ligation will provide new avenues for amines and isonitriles in chemical biology applications.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used to track biomolecules in living systems. Due to stringent requirements of physiological conditions, enriching the toolkit of bioorthogonal reactions remains the most important and challenging issue. Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second&#8208;order reaction rate constant (k2) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells.

&lt;p&gt;Biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed here. Direct labeling of Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells, which may be used to diagnose proteins with abnormal expression in their native habitats. The ligation will provide new avenues for amines and isonitriles in chemical biology applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used to track biomolecules in living systems. Due to stringent requirements of physiological conditions, enriching the toolkit of bioorthogonal reactions remains the most important and challenging issue. Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second-order reaction rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Direct labeling of Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Organic Compounds (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 37/2023)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the emission of circularly polarized light from organic compounds under a magnetic field. This phenomenon, called magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is observed due to the action of the magnetic field itself on the electronic states of the molecule. MCPL can provide chemists with an additional tool to access photophysical information of organic compounds. More information can be found in the Review by F. Zinna and G. Pescitelli.

In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. The current challenges and opportunities in organocatalytic and biocatalytic ARA are also discussed.







Abstract
This review summarizes the recent progress of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA), a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis, and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually Hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.

         <title>Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 37, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is the phenomenon through which non&#8208;chiral compound emit circularly polarized light under a magnetic field. Potentialities and limitations of MCPL from organic compounds are discussed.







Abstract
Achiral purely organic molecules can show selectivity towards circularly polarized light in emission in the presence of a magnetic field. This phenomenon is called magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL). Recently a few examples of MCPL from organic molecules have appeared in the literature. Through this technique, interesting photophysical information can be inferred and, moreover, a few technological applications can be devised based on this principle. This short review has the purpose to give a general introduction to this recent field of research and some critical insights on the reported examples.

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement derived from &#945;&#8208;thioesters/&#945;&#8208;selenoesters and sulfoxonium ylides has been developed for the synthesis of various sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing ortho&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in medium to excellent yields (39 examples; up to 97&#8201;%). Sulfoxonium ylides as the safe carbene precursors are firstly used in Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement reactions, which is superior to traditional diazo compounds. The present reaction has the advantages of mild condition, safety and broad substrate scope, which afford a unique method for the synthesis of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds with a tertiary carbon center.

         <title>A Biomimetic Stereoselective Approach to Euolutchuol C and Its Structural Assignment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stereoselective total synthesis of euolutchuol C is demonstrated using a biomimetic cationic polyene cyclization, and its absolute structure is established. Four potential stereoisomers of euolutchuol C were synthesized to confirm the structure as an aromatic abietane diterpenoid consisting of a 15(S)&#8208;stereogenic center. Asymmetric Sharpless dihydroxylation was employed to build the chiral epoxide, while CBS&#8208;reduction was utilized to obtain enantiomerically pure benzylic alcohols. A convergent approach is used to synthesize euolutchuol C in seven longest linear steps resulting in an overall yield of 23&#8201;%.

     alt="A Biomimetic Stereoselective Approach to Euolutchuol C and Its Structural Assignment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stereoselective total synthesis of euolutchuol C is demonstrated using a biomimetic cationic polyene cyclization, and its absolute structure is established. Four potential stereoisomers of euolutchuol C were synthesized to confirm the structure as an aromatic abietane diterpenoid consisting of a 15(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-stereogenic center. Asymmetric Sharpless dihydroxylation was employed to build the chiral epoxide, while CBS-reduction was utilized to obtain enantiomerically pure benzylic alcohols. A convergent approach is used to synthesize euolutchuol C in seven longest linear steps resulting in an overall yield of 23&#8201;%.

         <title>Direct Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones through (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Thioketones and Acetylenedicarboxylic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones are a hitherto very poorly studied class of sulfur heterocycles some of which have been shown to be important precursors for HIV drugs or bioactive, anticarcinogenic compounds. We have developed a novel and effective process for the direct generation of this structural motif in a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The cycloadducts were obtained with complete regioselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield. The heterocyclic motif was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel protocol for the direct synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones based on the (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The products were obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction within short reaction times and in typically very good yields. The product structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Benzyl Alcohols to N&#8208;Protected Anilines and Alkyl Alcohols to Carbamoyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot, scalable procedures converting benzylic or aliphatic alcohols to various N&#8208;functionalized amines are reported in 38&#8208;83% overall yields. These multi&#8208;step conversions are relatively economic and involve the oxidative formation of acid chloride intermediates and the Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides. Notable aspects of economy include: (1) the use of a relatively green solvent (chlorobenzene) that tolerates both ionic and radical reactions, without the need for rigorously dry or O2&#8208;free conditions; (2) the use of minimal amounts of trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and green chlorinating agent to oxidize the alcohol starting materials and then transform the aldehyde intermediates to acid chlorides under photoirradiation for azide addition; (3) the efficient capture of isocyanate intermediates by alcohol or azide nucleophiles providing N&#8208;protected anilines or N&#8208;protected alkylamines, respectively, the latter of which was employed in the synthesis of an anti&#8208;dementia drug, memantine hydrochloride, over two purification steps.</dc:description>

A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reaction, using N&#8208;chlorophthalimide as electrophilic chlorine source, enabling the facile synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in one step from readily available terminal alkynes and azides is reported. This approach allowed complete control of regioselectivities with a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzofused Five&#8208;Membered N/O/S Heterocycles, a Progressive Area in Synthetic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, possessing a single heteroatom, have important applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material chemistry. Metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions are well&#8208;established synthetic pathways for the formation of C&#8208;X bonds, enabling the direct synthesis of heterocycles. This approach offers advantages over traditional methods, such as fewer steps, increased atom economy, low catalyst loading, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Due to their widespread uses in the pharmaceutical industry, the formation of C&#8208;N, C&#8208;O, and C&#8208;S bonds has gained significant attention. This article focusses on the metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis and corresponding mechanistic approaches for N/O/S heterocycles, particularly indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, reviewing the progress of the past five years and discussing unexplored future opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Electron&#8208;Rich Dibenzofurans through NBu4OAc&#8208;Mediated Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;donating substituents. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base and ligand, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to dibenzofurans.







Abstract
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;rich aryl rings. Forming the key intramolecular Ar&#8722;Ar bond using traditional cross&#8208;coupling is difficult. The C&#8722;H functionalisation (C&#8722;H activation) approach is, in principle, far more useful. However, we previously found that the well&#8208;established conditions, which promote C&#8722;H functionalisation through Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation (CMD), proved unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base, ligand and solvent, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to electron&#8208;rich dibenzofurans.

         <title>Distinct Heterocyclic Moieties Govern the Selectivity of Thiophene&#8208;Vinylene&#8208;Based Ligands towards A&#946; or Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tau be or not tau be. A variety of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;vinylene&#8208;based ligands was synthesized. Ligands with specific chemical composition displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology and distinct heterocyclic moieties governed the selectivity of the ligand towards A&#946; or tau pathology. We foresee that these findings will aid in designing ligands towards disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Distinct aggregated proteins are correlated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases and the development of ligands that selectively detect these pathological hallmarks is vital. Recently, the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based optical ligands, denoted bi&#8208;thiophene&#8208;vinyl&#8208;benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), that could be utilized for selective assignment of tau pathology in brain tissue with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, was reported. Herein, we investigate the ability of these ligands to selectively distinguish tau deposits from aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), the second AD associated pathological hallmark, when replacing the terminal thiophene moiety with other heterocyclic motifs. The selectivity for tau pathology was reduced when introducing specific heterocyclic motifs, verifying that specific molecular interactions between the ligands and the aggregates are necessary for selective detection of tau deposits. In addition, ligands having certain heterocyclic moieties attached to the central thiophene&#8208;vinylene building block displayed selectivity to aggregated A&#946; pathology. Our findings provide chemical insights for the development of ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of different proteins and might also aid in creating novel agents for clinical imaging of tau pathology in AD.

         <title>2&#8208;(o&#8208;Tolyl) Pyridine as Ligand Improves the Efficiency in Ketone Directed ortho&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we explore how adding a catalytic amount of an NC&#8208;type ligand improves ketone&#8208;directed ortho C&#8722;H arylation, whereas a full equivalent shuts down the transformation. Increased catalytic activity stems from the formation of a cyclometallated complex containing the NC&#8208;type ligand to provide an intermediate which accelerates the ortho&#8208;arylation of the ketone substrate.







Abstract
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ketone directed ortho&#8208;arylation wherein the addition of a bidentate NC&#8208;type ligand, most effectively 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine, significantly enhances the C&#8722;H arylation reaction. Various aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones, including cyclic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ones, are competent substrates, and arylboronic acid esters were used as aryl sources. However, substitution with OMe and CF3 in the aromatic ring of the ketone substrates is not tolerated, while such residues on the benzoic ester are possible. Notably, this study provides valuable insights into ketone&#8208;directed ortho arylation in the presence of 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine and adds additional options for catalyst and ligand optimization in ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have described an efficient protocol for the photoinduced defluorocarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrene using formate as the CO2 radical anion precursor, which successfully yields a wide variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinylacetic acids with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient protocol in which formate is used as a precursor of the CO2 radical anion for the photoinduced defluorocarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrene. A wide range of gem&#8208;difluorovinylacetic acids bearing a variety of functional groups were successfully obtained in the absence of metal catalysts. The synthetic value of this protocol was highlighted by successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification for complex biologically active molecules. This protocol provides a complementary method that extends the range of currently available methodologies for accessing the structurally versatile gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron&#8208;donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied. In this study, a well&#8208;defined NHO ligated&#8208;Pd catalyst was developed. N&#8208;substituents on NHO ligand affected the catalytic performance, and the addition of a phosphine co&#8208;ligand, in particular [2&#8208;(MeO)C6H4]3P was effective to enhance the activity.

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron&#8208;donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied. In this study, we synthesized 2&#8208;methyleneimidazolidine ligands equipped with a bicyclic frameworks with the goal of developing a NHO&#8208;ligated Pd catalyst. These synthesized [(NHO)PdCl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)]2 complexes had a phosphine co&#8208;ligand that proved effective as a catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling at ambient temperature. By optimizing the N&#8208;substituents of NHO ligands and a phosphine co&#8208;ligand, we developed a [(NHO)Pd{[2&#8208;(CH3O)C6H4]3P}Cl2] complex as a catalyst that shows good catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;N-heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron-donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied.

Newly developed rigid&#8208;featured chiral Fu&#8208;2NO ligands possesses two pyrroloimidazolone&#8208;based N&#8208;oxides as non&#8208;flat chiral walls, and afforded the opportunity for fine&#8208;tuning the ligand's electronic and conformational properties by judicious choice of the substituent in the nonligating nitrogen atom.







Abstract
To expand the chemical space of chiral N&#8208;oxides and chiral furan&#8208;containing ligands, herein we designed and synthesized a new class of rigid&#8208;featured tertiary amine&#8208;derived C2&#8208;symmetric chiral furan&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide (Fu&#8208;2NO) ligands from optically pure l&#8208;prolinamides/hydroxylprolinamides in operationally simple two steps and up to 57&#8201;% overall yield. The newly developed rigid&#8208;featured chiral Fu&#8208;2NO ligands possesses two pyrroloimidazolone&#8208;based N&#8208;oxides as non&#8208;flat chiral walls, and afforded the opportunity for fine&#8208;tuning the ligand electronic and conformational properties by judicious choice of the substituent in the nonligating nitrogen atom. More importantly, The Fu&#8208;2NO ligands can tolerate air and moisture such that no special handling is needed for their storage, and can be applied in the Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction of indole.

         <title>Enantiospecific Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Hyacinthacine A1 and (+)&#8208;Hyacinthacine A1 and Their Homologues Using Nitrogen Substituted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, enantiospecific total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1&#8901;HCl and (+)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1&#8901;HCl were achieved. The key reactions were highly stereo&#8208; and regioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation with rhodium(II) acetate and regioselective ring opening of nitrogen&#8208;substituted D&#8722;A cyclopropanes.







Abstract
A concise and efficient enantiospecific total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 and (+)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 was achieved from commercially available starting material L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid and D&#8208;glutamic acid, respectively. For the synthesis of this trihydroxylated pyrrolizidine ring, we employed the nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane as a key intermediate. The synthetic approach relies on two crucial steps, highly stereo&#8208; and regioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation with Rh2(OAc)4 and regioselective ring opening of a nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane.

         <title>An Unexpected Synthesis of Crowded Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene dioxide with two equivalents of tetracyclone yields a heptaphenyl triphenylene, presumably by double Diels&#8208;Alder addition followed by fragmentation and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.







Abstract
In attempts to make octaphenyldibenzofuran (7) and octaphenyldibenzothiophene (8), 2,5&#8208;dibromofuran (4) and 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene (5), respectively, were heated with tetracyclone (2) under forcing conditions, but only single addition products, such as 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzofuran (10) and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzothiophene (12) were observed. However, when 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide (6) was heated with tetracyclone, the chief product was 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyltriphenylene (14). Similarly, when compound 6 was heated with acecyclone (15), the product was 11,18,20&#8208;triphenyldiacenaphtho[a,h]triphenylene (16). Both 14 and 16 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. They are proposed to form from double Diels&#8208;Alder addition products of the cyclopentadienones by extrusion of sulfur dioxide and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation Total Synthesis of the Pigment Aurantricholone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously, 6,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;ketoketals&#8221;) gained by ring&#8208;closing metatheses (&#8220;RCMs&#8221;) gave 6&#8208;hydroxybenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;benzotropolones&#8221;) by hydrolyses with 10&#8197;equiv. of hot TsOH. Now, an RCM&#8208;based ketoketal allowed to reach the benzotropolone aurantricholone by total synthesis for the second time and to avoid a forcing hydrolysis. Another key to success was establishing the pulvinone(&#8722;like) motifs by our recently developed Suzuki strategy.







Abstract
Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring&#8208;enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8208; step 9 overall &#8208; engaged this motif in a &#946;&#8208;elimination of ROH rather than in a hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O&#8208;methyl 4&#8208;methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O&#8208;methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et&#8197;al. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr3/CH2Cl2 (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 co&#8208;crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Axially Iodobenzocarbazole Derivatives by Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III)&#8208;Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Iodoarylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct protocol for the facile construction of axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives via the catalytic asymmetric iodocyclization of indole moiety linked alkynes, using stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex as the catalyst, has been developed. A range of versatile axially chiral iodobenzocarbazoles were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% ee under mild conditions.







Abstract
A new synthetic approach to novel axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives based on the highly enantioselective intramolecular iodoarylation of linked alkyne&#8208;indole systems was developed by using the versatile chiral catalyst, stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex, through an axially chiral iodinated vinylidene o&#8208;quinone methide (IVQM) intermediate. This protocol provides 21 examples in excellent yields with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield, 98&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, the introduced iodine atoms can easily be converted into other functional groups.

         <title>Formal Radical Deoxyfluorination of Oxalate&#8208;Activated Alcohols Triggered by the Selectfluor&#8208;DMAP Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex</title>

In this work, a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols is reported.







Abstract
We present a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols. The method relies on the spontaneous generation of the N&#8208;(chloromethyl)triethylenediamine radical dication, a potent single electron oxidant, from Selectfluor and 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine. The protocol is easily scalable and provides the desired fluorinated products within only a few minutes reaction time.

         <title>Green Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Unsubstituted Isoquinolones through Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8210;H Activation and Annulation in Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and convenient synthesis of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones has been achieved from N&#8208;methoxybenzamides and vinylene carbonate as an acetylene surrogate with a versatile rhodium(III) catalyst. The reaction proceeded at room temperature in biomass derived ethanol solvent. This protocol avoids the use of stoichiometric external oxidant, as the vinylene carbonate served as the internal oxidant. The C&#8210;H/N&#8210;H activation and annulation manifold proceeded with broad substrate scope and excellent levels of regioselectivities. The preliminary mechanistic studies suggest facile and reversible chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8210;H rhodation. Diversification of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones provide access to 4&#8208;substituted isoquinolones and 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolines, which are complementary to the previously reported protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling between Two Different Tosylates Enabled by Nickel/Palladium Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl tosylate with &#945;&#8208;CF3 benzyl tosylate is presented. This protocol is the first example of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between two different tosylates by Pd/Ni cooperative catalysis.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions are efficient for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds under relatively mild conditions, and hence widely used for making new molecules. Among various electrophiles, the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction between two different tosylates has been rarely studied. Herein, we present a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl tosylate (C(sp2)&#8722;OTs) and &#945;&#8208;CF3 benzyl tosylate (C(sp3)&#8722;OTs) by nickel/palladium cooperative catalysis. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the activation of C(sp2)&#8722;OTs bond and C(sp3)&#8722;OTs bond was facilitated by nickel and palladium respectively.

This protocol is the first example of cross-electrophile coupling between two different tosylates by Pd/Ni cooperative catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-electrophile coupling reactions are efficient for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds under relatively mild conditions, and hence widely used for making new molecules. Among various electrophiles, the cross-electrophile coupling reaction between two different tosylates has been rarely studied. Herein, we present a cross-electrophile coupling of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenyl tosylate (C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;OTs) and &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; benzyl tosylate (C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;OTs) by nickel/palladium cooperative catalysis. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the activation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;OTs bond and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;OTs bond was facilitated by nickel and palladium respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful method to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available materials. In this review, the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes covering mainly contributions over the past decade are summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities in this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most powerful and straightforward methods to forge a new C&#8722;H bond and a new C&#8722;X (X=C, N, O, F, Si etc) bond, which provides an efficient way to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available feedstocks. Catalytic asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of simple alkenes is challenging but still highly sought after. This review will mainly focus on the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes over the past decade, including hydroamination, hydrooxygenation, hydrofluorination, hydrosilylation, hydroarylation, hydroalkenylation and hydrocarbonylation.

         <title>Radical Dearomatising Spirocyclisation of Benzisoxazole&#8208;Tethered Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of densely functionalised spirocyclic products through a radical dearomative spirocyclisation chain mechanism is described. The spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step ring expansion sequence.







Abstract
The dearomative spirocyclisation of benzisoxazoles through a radical chain mechanism is described. Densely functionalised spirocycles were prepared in high yields by reacting benzisoxazole&#8208;tethered ynones with aryl thiols in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. The identification of stabilising three&#8208;electron interactions was key to the development of this new radical cascade reaction. The obtained spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step hydrogenolysis&#8208;cyclisation sequence.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Defluoroborylation of 3,3&#8208;Difluoropropenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free defluoroborylation of 3,3&#8208;difluoropropenes has been developed. The reaction involves the convenient borylation agent B2pin2 and a combination of both TBAF and HMDS as an activating system. The fluorinated allylboronates were used as a platform to prepare functionalized monofluoroalkenes.







Abstract
The defluorinative functionalization of allylic fluorides represents an attractive approach for the preparation of molecules containing a monofluoroalkene core. In that sense, introducing a &#8220;boryl nucleophile&#8221; is a powerful strategy to obtain polyvalent borylated intermediates as versatile synthetic precursors. To perform this reaction without the use of transition metals, the nucleophilic character of a diborane/fluoride system was exploited in a SN2&#8242; type&#8208;substitution reaction of gem&#8208;difluoropropenes to install a pinacolborane group. The use of HMDS as a silylated additive is necessary to improve the reactivity. A direct oxidation of the intermediate boronates allowed the isolation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;fluoroallyl alcohols in low to good yields (9&#8211;81&#8201;%). Other synthetic transformations of a (2&#8208;fluoroallyl)boronate are also illustrated.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Molecules: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherent chirality represents a distinct form of molecular chirality that does not fit into the four traditional types of molecular chiral elements, which has been observed in a diverse range of molecular structures. This review summarizes the recent advances in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral molecules, including chiral calixarenes, saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycles, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes and others.







Abstract
Inherent chirality represents a distinct category of molecular chirality that does not fall within the traditional classification of four chiral elements: central, axial, planar, and helical chirality. While extensive research has been conducted on the catalytic enantioselective construction of these conventional chiralities, the corresponding synthesis of inherently chiral molecules has remained largely unexplored. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in this field, focusing on the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of inherently chiral calixarenes, saddle&#8208;shaped tetraphenylenes and their heterocycle derivatives, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes and chiral multilayer 3D frameworks, as well as our perspective in this field.

&lt;p&gt;This Concept article summarises recent advances in approaches to the synthesis of important vinyl stannane building blocks in a stereocontrolled and regiocontrolled manner. Particular emphasis is put on those routes in which judicious choice of ligand affords a switchable reaction, providing routes to stereodefined olefins from a single starting material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organostannanes have represented one of the most widely applied reagents in modern cross-coupling chemistry and represent a key reagent in the synthesis of a range of pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds. This Concept article reviews recent advances in approaches to the synthesis of these building blocks in a stereocontrolled and regiocontrolled manner. Particular focus is paid to methods which allow for divergent synthesis of alkenylstannanes and developments in methods which present opportunities for sustainable synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation of Quinolines under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PNP pincer manganese complex was applied as catalyst for transfer hydrogenation of quinolines with ammonia borane as hydrogen source. 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines were obtained under mild conditions with good to excellent yields. 1,2&#8208;Dihydroquinolines were detected by 1H NMR in the progress and isotopic labelling experiments were performed to determine the destination of ammonia&#8208;borane hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient methodology for the homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalysed transfer hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles by using ammonia&#8208;borane as a hydrogen source under mild reaction conditions is reported. Good to excellent isolated yields are achieved by applying a PNP manganese pincer complex. In the reaction, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline is detected as intermediate by NMR spectra analysis and deuterium labelling experiment. The catalytic reaction likely proceeded by an outer&#8208;sphere pathway based on the bifunctional pincer complex.

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatization of Chalcone&#8208;Based Quinolinium Salts to Assemble Bridged Quinobenzazepine Polycycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we designed and synthesized a range of multi&#8208;functional chalcone&#8208;based quinolinium salts and their synthetic application in the rapid and straightforward construction of oxa&#8208;bridged quinobenzazepine polycycles was successfully explored.







Abstract
Quinobenzazepines are useful in medicinal chemistry, but their synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a range of multi&#8208;functional chalcone&#8208;based quinolinium salts; their synthetic application in the rapid and straightforward construction of quinobenzazepines was successfully explored. A wide range of oxa&#8208;bridged quinobenzazepine polycycles were afforded serendipitously through a dearomative cascade reaction of our newly developed quinolinium salts and acetylacetone. This synthetic strategy features high bond&#8208; and ring&#8208;forming efficiency and complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselective control.

         <title>Diaminocyclopentadienone Ruthenium Complex Catalyzed Alkylation of Indoles and Ketones with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borrowing hydrogen approach allows the direct utilization of non&#8208;activated alcohols as alkylating agents. A readily available, air and moisture stable ruthenium complex proves to be a particularly effective hydrogen autotransfer catalyst for the alkylation of various indoles or ketones with poorly reactive alcohols.







Abstract
A diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complex has proven to be a highly effective catalyst for the alkylation of indoles or ketones with poorly reactive alcohols. The catalyst is readily available, air and moisture stable and exhibits wide functional group tolerance. The environmentally benign procedure follows a borrowing hydrogen mechanism and requires no excess of either component. Various indoles and ketones are selectively monoalkylated in high yield.

         <dc:description>Asymmetric Olefin Metathesis (AOM) represents a highly versatile synthetic tool to lead to relevant chiral building blocks with excellent enantiopurity. As the Z&#8208;alkene moiety is ubiquitous in a wide range of natural products, the development of catalysts which are able to control both the Z&#8208;selectivity and the enantioselectivity of metathesis transformations is in high demands. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview covering all the breakthroughs accomplished in the field of challenging Z&#8208;enantioselective olefin metathesis, which is of interest in the total synthesis of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Fully Substituted and Diversely Functionalized Pyrazoles through p&#8208;TSA Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Condensation of Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Diketones, Arylglyoxals and Arylhydrazones</title>

         <dc:description>
An acid catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation of readily available cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones, arylglyoxals and arylhydrazones produces a library of diversely functionalized pyrazole derivatives in excellent yield under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free benign conditions.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, and atom economic synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically important fully substituted and functionalized pyrazole derivatives has been accomplished under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free benign conditions. The strategy involves early condensation of readily available cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones (dimidone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) and arylglyoxals to generate a chalcone type intermediate which upon acid catalyzed condensation with ambident nucleophile arylhydrazones produces various aryl and cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketone substituted pyrazole derivatives. The synthesis embraces high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, excellent yield of the products, short reaction time and operationally simple and mild reaction conditions. The synthesis provides an easy opportunity of incorporating biologically important N&#8208;diarylsulfide/selenide functionality, various enolisable cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones and other bioactive heterocycles concurrently to pyrazole, which may help in designing and development of pyrazole derivatives of pharmacological significance.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Pantolactone: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(R)&#8208;Pantolactone, an intermediate in the syntheses of Vitamin B5 and coenzyme A, is an important chiral molecule often used as a food additive, chiral auxiliary, and chiral starting material for organic transformations. Enantioenriched pantolactones are predominantly produced by biological fermentation and chemical synthesis approaches. Herein, we present a review of recent developments in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone via different methods, and systematically summarize the characteristics and advantageous features of these strategies. Among the strategies discussed herein, the direct asymmetric catalysis of glyoxylate and isobutyraldehyde with small organocatalyst molecules has attracted growing attention owing to its good step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, absence of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, convenient operation, and low catalyst loading. These characteristics render the direct asymmetric route to pantolactone a particularly attractive procedure. This review provides valuable guidance for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Hydrohalogenation and Deuteriohalogenation by ex situ Generation of HX and DX Gas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrohalogenation of olefins is one of the most straightforward methods to access alkyl halides. Despite safety hazards, using pure hydrogen halide gas remains the most atom economic way of performing hydrohalogenation reactions. In this work, we describe the solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins using down to near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas. Two&#8208;chamber reactors are employed as an enabling platform to access these reactive gases in a laboratory setting. Ex situ generation from inexpensive and readily available precursors provides on&#8208;demand access to these gases (hydrogen chloride, deuterium chloride, hydrogen bromide, deuterium bromide, hydrogen iodide, and deuterium iodide) with precise stoichiometric control. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.</dc:description>

An efficient rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/allylation reaction of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles with easily available vinylethylene carbonate has been reported. A series of allyl alcohol substituted 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles were obtained.







Abstract
An efficient rhodium(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;indazoles with easily available vinylethylene carbonate has been reported. A series of allyl alcohol substituted 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;indazoles were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance and favourable stereoselectivity. Notably, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;O bonds were selectively activated in &#8220;one pot&#8221; manner, releasing CO2 as the sole by&#8208;product and avoiding external oxidant. This protocol provides a powerful approach for the post stage C&#8722;H allylation of indazole&#8208;based substrates.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Scaffolds for Light Emission</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we reported novel three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores with highly efficient luminescence in both solution and solid states have attracted significant attention due to their ability to circumvent the limitations of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission type molecules. However, their development and wide&#8208;range applications are hampered by extremely complex synthetic methodologies and limited frameworks with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) structural characteristics. In sharp contrast to the reported luminogens with big and planar &#960; systems or highly conjugated and twisted structures, we discovered novel three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance. Our findings should open new avenues for designing DSE molecules with new frameworks, which will enable more successful development of dual&#8208;state emitters for their broad applications in the future.

These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic fluorophores with highly efficient luminescence in both solution and solid states have attracted significant attention due to their ability to circumvent the limitations of aggregation-caused quenching and aggregation-induced emission type molecules. However, their development and wide-range applications are hampered by extremely complex synthetic methodologies and limited frameworks with dual-state emission (DSE) structural characteristics. In sharp contrast to the reported luminogens with big and planar &#960; systems or highly conjugated and twisted structures, we discovered novel three-dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance. Our findings should open new avenues for designing DSE molecules with new frameworks, which will enable more successful development of dual-state emitters for their broad applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Deuterated and Protiated Triacylglycerides by Using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole Activated Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical methodology for the synthesis of triacylglycerides utilizing fatty acids activated by 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was developed to obtain protiated and deuterated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oils as well as a synthetic plant oil mimic. New insights into the mechanism of the CDI activation were gained using deuterated substrates and via density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.







Abstract
Synthetic model triacylglyceride oils are important compounds for applications in pharmaceutical and food chemistry. Herein, a practical and highly efficient methodology for the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated triacylglycerides utilizing saturated and unsaturated fatty acids activated by 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) has been developed and applied in the synthesis of deuterated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil for studies of plant&#8208;based and diary food emulsions. The deuterium labelled compounds were used to gain new insight into the mechanism of the reaction, which was confirmed by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Ribosyl Adenosine 5&#8242;,5&#8243;&#8208;Diphosphate Fragment of Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosyl adenosine 5&#8242;,5&#8243;&#8208;diphosphate is a poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) fragment covalently bonded to a protein during post&#8208;translational modification. Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) is involved in several biological processes such as DNA repair and cancerization. Herein, we report the development of two synthetic approaches to&#160;the poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) fragment via a common precursor. The major difficulty in the synthesis of the fragment is the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8243;&#8594;2&#8242;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation between the ribose and adenosine because of the lack of neighboring group participation and low reactivity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl group. The first approach employed an indirect method that involved stepwise assembly of the ribosyl adenosine framework by O&#8208;ribofuranosylation of a commercially available ribose acceptor and subsequent N&#8208;glycosylation of N6&#8208;benzoyl adenine (11 linear longest sequence (LLS) steps, 14.5% overall yield). In the second approach, the direct O&#8208;ribofuranosylation of a known 6&#8208;chloropurine riboside acceptor was adopted (9 LLS steps, 10.3% overall yield). Thus, two practical synthetic approaches to the target fragment were successfully established in terms of the number of LLS steps and overall yield. Furthermore, the precursor was converted into a conjugation&#8208;ready building block, primed for application in ADP&#8208;ribose oligomer synthesis.</dc:description>

An efficient copper(II) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex catalyzing the Chan&#8211;Evans&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic nucleophiles with arylboronic acid has been explored.

Abstract
An efficient copper(II) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex with an NCN coordination mode was optimized to catalyze the Chan&#8211;Evans&#8208;Lam (CEL) cross&#8208;coupling reaction of imidazole and other N&#8208;heterocyclic nucleophiles with arylboronic acid. This air&#8208;stable copper catalyst shows robust catalytic performance and tolerates a diverse array of functional groups on both the N&#8208;nucleophile and arylboronic acid coupling partners in C&#8722;N bond forming reactions with up to 95&#8201;% yield. Formation of the Cu&#8722;NHC complex in&#8197;situ generated similar catalytic performance for CEL coupling. Alternative metal ions (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ru2+, and Pd2+) were also screened in the presence of the NHC precursor as CEL catalysts.

Stereoselective total syntheses of (+)&#8208;goniochelienlactone, (+)&#8208;7&#8208;acetylgoniochelienlactone and (&#8722;)&#8208;goniopypyrone were accomplished by divergent strategies starting from readily available chiral pool methyl &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranoside.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Microwave&#8208;Assisted Sonogashira Reactions of Triflate&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins that bear halogens at the meso&#8208;aryl positions are useful building blocks for the preparation of light&#8208;harvesting arrays and materials through cross&#8208;coupling procedures. Despite the wide use of such intermediates, their scale&#8208;up and purification are usually hampered by tedious chromatographic separations because of the statistical nature of the synthetic protocol and the similar polarity of the different products. Here, we propose the use of porphyrins bearing a triflatophenyl group as alternative starting materials for palladium cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In particular, purification of the zinc 5,10,15&#8208;triaryl&#8208;20&#8208;(4&#8208;triflatophenyl)porphyrin (ZnP&#8208;OTf) model compound by column chromatography proved to be much easier compared to porphyrin analogues that carry halogen substituents. This is the result of the increased polarity of compounds functionalized by highly polar triflate groups if compared to those substituted by halogens. To show the value of the triflatophenylporphyrin model compound in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we developed a microwave&#8208;assisted Sonogashira protocol that quantitatively converts the ZnP&#8208;OTf to the corresponding alkynylphenylporphyrin, in relatively short reaction times. Finally, we showed that the proposed ZnP&#8208;OTf building block can be conveniently converted into an alkynyl&#8208;linked molecular wire to bridge the zinc porphyrin donor with the [60]fullerene acceptor in a molecular dyad.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT Calculations and Synthesis Reveal: Key Intermediates, Omitted Mechanisms, and Unsymmetrical Bimane Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the mechanism behind the formation of fluorescent syn&#8208;bimane. This work combines theoretical and experimental approaches. Our computational study supports Kosower's mechanism while introducing a crucial diaziridine intermediate. Our results suggest the rate&#8208;limiting step is the formation of a diazoketene. The reaction of 4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazacyclopentadienone with diphenylcyclopropenone produced the unexpected unsymmetrical anti&#8208;(Me,Me)(Ph,Ph)bimane.







Abstract
Theoretical and experimental mixed approaches are complementary and valuable. Our DFT calculations support the mechanism suggested by Kosower, adding to it a key diaziridine intermediate that determines the relative product distribution of this reaction. Our results are consistent with the formation of the diazoketene intermediate as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Based on curve fittings, first or second&#8208;order kinetics cannot be ruled out. This may indicate that more than one mechanism is simultaneously at play in this transformation. This unexpected outcome led us to study an alternative cyclopropenone intermediate. Although cyclopropenone is not likely to be formed under thermal conditions, adding it to the reaction mixture results in bimane structures. The most staggering finding from this investigation was the unanticipated generation of the unsymmetrical anti&#8208;(Me,Me)(Ph,Ph)bimane. The optimization of this route towards unsymmetrical bimanes will require additional investigation.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Ortho Effect on the Excited State Pathways of Chloroanilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry allows to elucidate the observed selectivity in the photochemistry of chloroanilines. A meta&#8208;ortho effect of the substituents favours the population of the prefulvenic conical intersection which leads to rapid deactivation of the m&#8208; and o&#8208;isomers of chloroaniline, while the para derivative lives long enough to emit and populate the reactive triplet state which leads to C&#8722;Cl dissociation.







Abstract
Direct excitation of aromatic compounds grants access to high&#8208;energy intermediates that can be utilised in organic synthesis. Understanding and predicting the substituent effects at the excited state for aromatic molecules remains challenging for the synthetic photochemist. In this work, we present an experimental and computational investigation of the excited state of the isomeric chloroanilines, which promptly react by losing the chloride when the amino group is in para position, but are non&#8208;reactive and non&#8208;emissive in the meta and ortho isomers. XMS&#8208;CASPT2//CASSCF computations explain this apparent contradiction of the meta&#8208;ortho selectivity rule of Zimmerman, which originates from the substituent effects lowering to a different extent the barrier to populate the prefulvenic conical intersection that deactivates non&#8208;radiatively the singlet excited state of the chloroanilines.

In this work, we present an experimental and computational investigation of the excited state of the isomeric chloroanilines, which promptly react by losing the chloride when the amino group is in &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; position, but are non-reactive and non-emissive in the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; isomers. XMS-CASPT2//CASSCF computations explain this apparent contradiction of the &lt;i&gt;meta-ortho&lt;/i&gt; selectivity rule of Zimmerman, which originates from the substituent effects lowering to a different extent the barrier to populate the prefulvenic conical intersection that deactivates non-radiatively the singlet excited state of the chloroanilines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An efficient three&#8208;component synthesis of disubstituted 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminothiazoles was reported. The protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, short reaction time, easily available starting materials, good yields and broad substrates scope, showing potential synthetic value for the synthesis of a variety of biological or pharmaceutical active compounds.







Abstract
An efficient three&#8208;component synthesis of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminothiazoles was reported. Phenyl&#8208;thioureas reacted with 2&#8208;bromoacetophenones to form 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminothiazoles through cyclization, and the subsequent C&#8722;N bonding with benzyl/allyl bromides gave the desired disubstituted thiazoles smoothly. The protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, short reaction time, easily available starting materials, good yields and broad substrate scope, showing potential synthetic value for the synthesis of a variety of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Pyrroles from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes and Phenacyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles using phenacyl azide and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde at room temperature has been developed. High yield, atom economy and requirement of economic substrates, reagents and organocatalyst as well as non&#8208;involvement of cryogenic or very high temperature and inert or anhydrous conditions make this protocol a sustainable synthetic approach towards the synthesis of 2&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;aroyl&#8208;pyrroles.







Abstract
Structurally diverse pyrroles were synthesized by direct coupling of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and phenacyl azides. The scope of the synthetic method was successfully demonstrated by synthesizing 28 different phenyl(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanones in high yields (87&#8211;95&#8201;%). Derivatization of a few synthesized pyrroles was demonstrated which shows the potential application of the developed protocol in new functional materials. To get a mechanistic insight of the reaction, a typical reaction was performed in a deuterated solvent and the progress of the reaction was monitored by recording its 1H NMR at regular time intervals.

         <title>Ring Transformation of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactams by Ring Transformation: &#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams with an exocyclic ester moiety in the &#948;&#8208;position were accessed by reduction of cyclic &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxocyclopentane carboxylates with Zn&#8722;AcOH. The ring transformation proceeded readily under the conditions of the reduction which is an unprecedented process.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams with an exocyclic ester moiety in the &#948;&#8208;position were accessed by reduction of 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentanone carboxylates with PBu3 or Zn&#8722;AcOH. The ring transformation proceeded readily under the conditions of this reduction which is an unprecedented process. Primary amines formed by catalytic hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with larger ring sizes or with benzannulation do not show this rearrangement under the conditions of the azide reduction. In these cases, the ring transformation to respective lactams was achieved by treatment of the &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a stoichiometric amount of lithium diisopropylamide.

         <title>A strategy for improving the efficiency of boronic acid catalysis in the synthesis of amides.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study outlines the development of novel boronic acids as catalysts for the direct synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines. The Lewis acidity of the boronic acids was estimated by means of computational techniques, and the observed increase in catalytic activity was corroborated by kinetic data derived from a model reaction. Our investigations led to the discovery of a set of ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. These newly developed catalysts demonstrated efficacy in the coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic acids, as well as primary and secondary amines.</dc:description>

         <title>UVA&#8208;Light Promoted Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Aerobic Oxidation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroxy group, and the phenol moiety in particular, is ubiquitous in several natural products, in organic synthesis and/or pharmaceutical industry. With the uprise of photoredox catalysis, many efforts worldwide focus on developing novel and sustainable protocols, providing an easy access to hydroxy&#8208;containing molecules. Boronic acids and boronic ester derivatives are considered valuable precursors for the synthesis of hydroxyl group derivatives. Herein, we report a novel, sustainable, light&#8208;driven protocol, where the impact of wavelength irradiation on boronic acid aerobic photooxidation was examined. In this work, UVA&#8208;light (370 nm) irradiation was found to promote the photocatalyst&#8208;free aerobic oxidation of boronic acids and boronic acid derivatives. Furthermore, a broad scope of substrates was tested and extensive mechanistic studies were performed, in order to probe the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Ex&#8208;Situ Generation of Bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide and Applications to Trifluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a convenient and operationally simple protocol for the ex&#8208;situ generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide from the readily available and commercial Langlois reagent is reported. The one&#8208;step synthesis of the toxic and volatile CF3SSCF3 is performed in a two&#8208;chamber reactor with simple PPh3 and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as the activator, allowing for the safe handling and tandem utilization in direct trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. The versatility of the ex&#8208;situ generated CF3SSCF3 is demonstrated in known electrophilic, nucleophilic, and a radical trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Furthermore, the application of the CF3SSCF3 in a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with boronic acids is disclosed, showing good to excellent yields of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aryl products, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Domino and Multicomponent Reactions: How to Reach Molecular Complexity without a Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it possible to build up molecular complexity without the help of a catalyst? Yes, it is! With the suitable starting&#8208;materials, a domino or multicomponent reaction can be initiated just turning on the right light.







Abstract
Achieving high molecular complexity can be not trivial, but the exploitation of domino reactions provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical method to reach this target. Over the past decades, a lot of efforts have been put on the development of photocatalytic cascades employing both metal&#8208;based and purely organic catalysts. Despite the effectiveness of these protocols, catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free light&#8208;induced domino reactions are gaining momentum thank to their efficiency, operational simplicity and sustainability. The increasing number of papers published on this field in the last years is a proof of the appeal of these transformations. In this Review, we discuss domino and multicomponent reactions mediated by light with a focus on photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free processes. The most recent advances in the synthesis of complex nitrogen&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulphur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;heterocycles together with multicomponent cascades are analysed with an emphasis on both experimental and mechanistic studies.

         <title>Protocell Communication through the Eyes of Synthetic Organic Chemists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, the bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries utilised for protocell communication are reviewed and categorised into enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated systems. Future opportunities for synthetic chemists to develop new bio&#8208;inspired and fully synthetic alternatives to these bio&#8208;derived machineries in the form of synthetic enzymes or &#8220;synzymes&#8221; are highlighted.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up fabrication of synthetic cells (protocells) from molecules and materials, is a major challenge of modern chemistry. A significant breakthrough has been the engineering of protocells capable of chemical communication using bio&#8208;derived molecules and ex situ stabilised cell machineries. These, however, suffer from short shelf&#8208;lives, high costs, and require mild aqueous conditions. In this Concept Article we analyse the chemistry at the heart of protocell communication to highlight new opportunities for synthetic chemists in protocell engineering. Specifically, we (i)&#8197;categorise the main bio&#8208;derived chemical communication machineries in enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated communication; (ii)&#8197;review the chemistries of these signal transduction machineries; and (iii)&#8197;introduce new types of bio&#8208;inspired, fully synthetic artificial enzymes to replace their natural counterparts. Developing protocells that incorporate synthetic analogues of bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries will improve the robustness, stability, and versatility of protocells, and broaden their applications to highly strategic fields such as photocatalysis and fine chemicals production.

         <title>Multienzymatic Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactam Building Blocks from Unsaturated Esters and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are produced through an enzymatic sequence combining a lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylamidation with an oxidase/peroxidase&#8208;induced ene&#8208;type cyclization. This methodology provides a mild and scalable access to N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks from basic &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters and aqueous hydroxylamine, and its utility is illustrated by the formal total synthesis of the tetracyclic alkaloid cephalotaxine.







Abstract
The assembly of enzymatic cascades and multi&#8208;step reaction sequences represents an attractive alternative to traditional synthetic&#8208;organic approaches. The biocatalytic reaction mediators offer not only mild conditions and permit the use of environmentally benign reagents, but the high compatibility of different enzymes promises more streamlined reaction setups. In this study, a triple&#8208;enzymatic strategy was developed that enables the direct conversion of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters to N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactam building blocks. Hereby, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylaminolysis generates hydroxamic acid intermediates that are subsequently aerobically activated by horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase to cyclize in an intramolecular nitroso ene reaction. Utilizing the hydroxylaminolysis/ene&#8208;cyclization sequence for the preparation of an aza&#8208;spirocyclic lactam, the multi&#8208;enzymatic methodology was successfully employed in the synthesis of key intermediates en route to alkaloids of the Cephalotaxus family.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric protocol for the synthesis of novel benzofused &#1013;&#8208;lactones starting from quinone methides and activated acetic acid esters using chiral isothiourea Lewis base catalysts has been developed.







Abstract
We herein report a two&#8208;step protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of novel chiral benzofused &#1013;&#8208;lactones starting from O&#8208;protected hydroxymethyl&#8208;para&#8208;quinone methides and activated aryl esters. By using chiral isothiourea Lewis base catalysts a broad variety of differently substituted products could be obtained in yields of around 50&#8201;% over both steps with high levels of enantioselectivities, albeit low diastereoselectivities only.

         <title>First Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Salinosporamides D and I Using Memory of Chirality and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was the stereoselective installation of three contiguous stereocenters on the pyrrolidinone core via a single aldol cyclization step, which employed the principles of &#8242;memory of chirality&#8221; and dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;salinosporamide D was achieved using d&#8208;serine as the sole chiral source. This approach stands out for its application of the principles of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution in the intramolecular aldol reaction of serine&#8208;derived oxazolidines. These strategies enabled the rapid construction of a pyrrolidinone core and installation of contiguous stereocenters. The key intermediate was readily obtained, culminating the asymmetric total synthesis of salinosporamide D. The total synthesis of salinosporamides A and I was also achieved using the same chemistry.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Synthesis of Optically Active Drug (S)&#8208;Clopidogrel</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step four reactions innovative asymmetric synthesis of popular antiplatelet drug (S)&#8208;clopidogrel, marketed as Plavix, has been developed. The telescoped approach relies on the use of a sole organocatalyst, commercially available reagents and a single solvent. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions enabled isolation of the drug in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A first catalytic preparation of the popular antiplatelet drug (S)&#8208;clopidogrel, known with the tradename of Plavix, has been developed in a one&#8208;pot and innovative approach. The synthesis can be performed using commercially available ortho&#8208;chlorobenzaldehyde, 1&#8208;naphthylsulfonyl acetonitrile, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyridine and 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a quinidine derived organocatalyst in a single solvent. A Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) sequence enabled to obtain (S)&#8208;clopidogrel in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions proved to be crucial to set up a selective and efficient process.

         <title>Efficient Solution Phase Synthesis of PPII Helix Mimicking Ena/VASP EVH1 Inhibitors from Proline&#8208;Derived Modules (ProMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search of EVH1 domain inhibitors as potential anti&#8208;metastasis drugs, we have developed an efficient and scalable liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of pseudo&#8208;peptidic ligands composed of conformationally defined proline&#8208;derived modules (ProMs).







Abstract
In the search for efficient inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain to reduce cell motility in metastatic cancer, we previously developed a toolkit of proline&#8208;derived modules (ProMs), which mimic the PPII helix found in the natural &#8722;FPPPP&#8722; binding motif of EVH1. In this work, we describe the modular assembly of these ProM&#8208;based pentapeptidic EVH1 ligands through liquid phase peptide synthesis. We initially used pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) active esters for amide bond formation and built up the growing peptide chain from the C&#8208; to the N&#8208;terminus. Switching to HATU/DIPEA coupling conditions and changing the directionality of the synthesis from the N&#8208; to the C&#8208;terminus afforded the target ligands with improved overall yields and purity. Employing a Fmoc&#8208;protected (instead of the N&#8208;acetylated) phenylalanine derivative as N&#8208;terminal building block significantly reduced epimerization. In contrast to the originally used solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the developed solution phase method allowed for a facile alteration of the C&#8208;terminal ProM unit and the production of various pentapeptidic ligands in an efficient fashion even on a multigram scale.

         <dc:description>
A palladium catalyzed decarboxylative [4+2] cycloaddition of vinyl benzoxazinanones with 1,3&#8208;indanedione was developed, affording a series of biologically potential spiro&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and product elaboration demonstrated the utility of this method. The product demonstrated exhibited potency in inhibiting MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line.







Abstract
A palladium catalyzed decarboxylative [4+2] cycloaddition of vinyl benzoxazinanones with 2&#8208;arylidene indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione has been established, which afford a series of bioactive spiro&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines (27 examples) in moderate to good yield (up to 87&#8201;%) with high diastereoselectivities. The synthetic utility of this reaction was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Compounds synthesized by this method potently inhibited proliferation in a panel of cancer cell lines. Particularly, the most potent compounds 3&#8201;ae, 3&#8201;ah, 3&#8201;aj and 3&#8201;fa displayed selective inhibition of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast carcinoma cells with IC50 values of 1.292, 0.6118, 0.6558, 1.656 and 2.215&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <dc:description>1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts having either aliphatic or benzylic substituents at the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 positions were synthesized in two steps involving: i) copper(I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), and ii)N&#8208;alkylation of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole intermediates. Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions in bulk and in the presence of excess methyl iodide were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy for each 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium molecular model. By assigning the different formed species and their respective evolution with time, it was possible to conclude that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the exchange reactions are noticeably faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position most likely due to the steric hindrance induced by the neighboring C&#8208;4 substituent. The kinetics of trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions are thus influenced by both the chemical nature of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents and the regiochemistry of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium group. This provides important structural design rules to improve the properties of thermosetting covalent adaptable networks involving trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Imidates are important organic intermediates used in several synthetic transformations towards N&#8208;heterocycles, natural products and metal complexes with a potential catalytic effect. Herein, the recent synthetic approaches and diverse applications of imidates were categorized and summarized. A wide range of organic compounds, mainly nitriles, isocyanides, amides, imines, and alkynes are used as starting materials. This review also summarizes the latest synthetic approaches to imidates that have been developed the recent years and some of their significant applications in the field of organic synthesis.







Abstract
Recent synthetic approaches and diverse applications of imidates are presented in this review. These motifs are successfully used as intermediates in organic transformations, such as the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, natural products and metal complexes with a potential catalytic effect. Consequently, many attempts have been made for the development of efficient and facile synthetic methods of imidates in the past few years, as a continuum of previous paths. A wide range of organic compounds can be used as starting materials for these syntheses, including nitriles, isocyanides, amides etc. which through simple and flexible processes are converted to the desired imidates. Herein, an exploration of the recent synthetic routes of imidates and their diverse applications in organic transformations has been categorized and summarized.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides through Addition of Organometallic Reagents to N&#8208;tert&#8208;Butanesulfinyl Glycosylamines: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the preparation and reactivity of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines with simple Grignard and organo lithium reagents is reported. As they readily react as latent imine equivalents with a variety of carbon nucleophiles in batch and continuous flow chemistry, these carbohydrate derivatives constitute very useful precursors for the diastereoselective synthesis of bioactive compounds such as iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of the preparation and reactivity of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines with simple Grignard and organo lithium reagents in batch vs. continuous flow chemistry is reported. As they readily react as latent imine equivalents with a variety of carbon nucleophiles, these carbohydrate derivatives constitute very useful precursors for the diastereoselective synthesis of bioactive compounds such as iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. A hybrid protocol, involving the addition of benzylmagnesium chloride to a (SR)&#8208;arabinofuranosylamine substrate in flow, at room temperature, combined with a cyclization protocol in batch is also described for the first time. Of note, this semi&#8208;continuous flow process shortens the synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycoside scaffolds to a single workday.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalysed Chemoselective Amination of Alcohols Using Heterocyclic Thiones: An Avenue to Thiotetrazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the development of a Cu(OTf)2 catalysed chemoselective amination of alcohols using heterocyclic thiones is described. Notably, the method is additive, ligand or inert atmosphere free and shows good tolerance towards variety of alcohols and thiotetrazole derivatives affording good to excellent yields of the product.







Abstract
Herein,a protocol for the chemoselective formation of C&#8722;N bond using Cu(OTf)2 as catalyst has been described using heterocyclic thiones. The reaction occurs preferentially at the nitrogen centre over the sulphur atom leading to C&#8722;N bond formation. Water being the only by&#8208;product, the reaction is environmentally friendly. The reaction proceeds without any additive, ligand or inert atmosphere and shows good tolerance towards variety of alcohols and thiotetrazole derivatives. Our developed protocol could be scaled up to gram scale efficiently, which highlights the efficacy of this method and might offer potential application in synthetic industry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PPh3&#8208;mediated nucleophilic sulfonation of sulfonyl chlorides with arynes has been demonstrated. This protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and provides a direct approach to a variety of aryl and alkyl sulfones.







Abstract
Sulfonyl chlorides are a class of cheap and readily available basic chemicals, which have routinely served as electrophilic reagents in their chemical transformations. Herein, we disclose a novel PPh3&#8208;mediated nucleophilic sulfonation method of sulfonyl chlorides with arynes. Different from the classical P(III)&#8208;mediated reductive deoxygenation reaction of sulfonyl chlorides, the valence state of the sulfur atom has not been changed. This protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and provides a direct approach to a variety of aryl and alkyl sulfones.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven approach towards phenanthridin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;one and carbazole rings synthesis under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is here reported. Phenanthridinones and carbazoles are synthesized through an intramolecular arylation of the corresponding N&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylanilines or N&#8208;substituted&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl anilines using KOtBu as base in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature (rt), employing blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light source. The reaction proceeds through photo&#8208; and base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution via photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and it exhibits good tolerance to different functional groups, resulting in good to very good yields (up to 86&#8201;%).

         <title>Tumor Carbohydrate Associated Antigen Analogs as Potential Binders for Siglec&#8208;7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding recognition of two structurally constrained sialyl derivatives by Siglec&#8208;7was investigated. The flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allowed the preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound containing a biphenyl moiety. Our results set the basis for the design and development of novel compounds as potential modulators for Siglec&#8208;7.







Abstract
We investigated two recently synthesized and characterized sialyl derivatives, bearing the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, as promising binders for Siglec&#8208;7, an inhibitory Siglec mainly found on natural killer cells. A variety of sialoglycan structures can be recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 with implications in the modulation of immune responses. Notably, overexpression of sialylated glycans recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 can be associated with the progression of several tumors, including melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. NOE&#8208;based NMR techniques, including Saturation Transfer Difference and transferred&#8208;NOESY NMR, together with molecular docking and dynamic simulations were combined to shed light on the molecular basis of Siglec&#8208;7 recognition of two conformationally constrained Sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen analogs. We, therefore, identify the ligands epitope mapping and their conformational features and propose 3D models accurately describing the protein&#8208;ligand complexes. We found that the binding site of Siglec&#8208;7 can accommodate both synthetic analogs, with the sialic acid mainly involved in the interaction. Moreover, the flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allows a preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound bearing a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid that contributed to the interaction to a large extent. Our findings provided insights for developing potential novel high affinity ligands for Siglec&#8208;7 to hinder tumor evasion.

         <dc:description>Trans&#8208;cycloalkenes with the X&#8211;C=C&#8211;SeR*&#8208;unit and ring sizes from 9 to 20 have been synthesized. Bond the selenium atom is the chiral (S)&#8208;o&#8208;(1&#8208;Methoxypropyl)phenyl&#8208;residue R*, and X = H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3. The planar&#8208;chiral trans&#8208;cycloalkenes in combination with the chiral residue R* exist as two diastereomers. These can be distinguished in principle by NMR spectroscopy. We have studied the epimerization of the trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, i.e., the 180&#176; rotation of the X&#8211;C=C&#8208;unit through the cavity of the ring. The measurements were done with variable temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy in the range from &#8211;110 to 140&#176;C. The obtained values of the Gibbs energy of activation &#916;G&#8225;C depend strongly on the ring size. Furthermore, the &#916;G&#8225;C values show dramatic steric effects due to the groups X. The steric requirement of X increases in the series H&#160;&lt;&lt; F &lt;&lt; Cl &lt; Me &lt; Br &lt; I &lt; Et &lt; CF3. Here, F is significantly larger than H, and CF3 is larger than Et. The corresponding iPr&#8208;compounds could not be synthesized. The transition state structures of the ring inversion for ring sizes 8&#8211;20 were calculated at the DFT level of theory.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase IRED, NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.</dc:description>

Exemplified for the (R)-enantioselective reduction of 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &amp;gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
