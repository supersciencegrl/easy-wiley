      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Selective and Diverse Synthesis of Three Distinct Sets of Isoindolinones from 2&#8208;Alkynylbenzoic Acids and Amines</title>
      <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free selective and diverse synthesis of three distinct sets of isoindolinones from 2&#8208;alkynylbenzoic acids and amines has been achieved in a reaction&#8208;condition&#8208;controlled manner. This method exhibits valuable advantageous features such as available starting materials, broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, good to high yields, good functional group tolerance, simple operation, high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and step economy, thus providing a convenient and efficient access to a variety of heterocyclic compounds incorporating the bioactive isoindolinone motif.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The metal&#8208;free selective and diverse synthesis of three distinct sets of isoindolinones from 2&#8208;alkynylbenzoic acids and amines has been achieved in a reaction&#8208;condition&#8208;controlled manner. This method exhibits valuable advantageous features such as available starting materials, broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, good to high yields, good functional group tolerance, simple operation, high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and step economy, thus providing a convenient and efficient access to a variety of heterocyclic compounds incorporating the bioactive isoindolinone motif.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>A simple one&#8208;pot, solvent&#8208;free method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines is presented. Conversely to the output from standard classical cycloaddition approaches, an unconventional connectivity is achieved with excellent chemoselectivity under neat conditions without requiring any metal catalyst or additional additive. Hence, various abundant (iso)quinolines and propiolic esters were transformed into the corresponding benzoindolizines in synthetically useful yields.

      <title>On the Regioselectivity of the Gould&#8722;Jacobs Reaction: Gas&#8208;phase versus Solution&#8208;phase Thermolysis</title>
      <dc:description>A detailed investigation on the regioselectivity in the thermal cyclization of (pyridyl)aminomethylenemalonates both in the gas&#8208; and solution phase is presented. Flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) as gas&#8208;phase thermolysis technique is used to study the Gould&#8722;Jacobs reaction at temperatures between 450&#8722;650 &#176;C, while different solution&#8208;phase heating techniques (reflux, microwave and continuous flow) were employed at 260&#8722;350 &#176;C. Depending on the position of the substituent in the pyridine moiety and the applied thermolysis technique, the regioselectivity of the cyclization can be controlled either in favor of the kinetic (pyridopyrimidinone) or the thermodynamic (naphthyridinone) product. Under FVP conditions, 6&#8208;substituted pyridopyrimidinones were obtained in high regioselectivity, which was not demonstrated before under standard Gould&#8722;Jacobs reaction conditions. DFT calculations have been additionally performed to provide further insights into the mechanistic pathways of this specific Gould&#8722;Jacobs reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of aryl pinacolboronate esters: alcohols as solvents  with application to  6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA  synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of arylboronic acid pinacol esters (ArylBPin) using Cu(OTf)  2  (Py)  4  complex is a useful approach for the introduction [  18  F]fluorine into&#160; non&#8208;activated arenes and heteroarenes. Due to complexity of the mechanism and wide variation in substrate reactivity the choice of reaction conditions must be made individually for every precursor. Careful selection of phase&#8208;transfer catalysts also plays a role, as Cu&#8208;catalyst and ArylBPin precursors are known to be unstable in basic conditions. Using tetrabuthylammonium triflate alcohol solution for elution of [  18  F]fluoride from ion&#8208;exchange cartridge and employing same alcohol as a co&#8208;solvent in the following labelling step, we have developed a general protocol resulting in &gt;80% fluorination efficiency of ArylBPin precursors for 4&#8208;[  18  F]fluoro&#8208;D,L&#8208;phenylalanine and 6&#8208;L&#8208;[  18  F]FDOPA. Radiofuorination in neat alcohol was particularly effective for the synthesis of 6&#8208;L&#8208;[  18  F]FDOPA, allowing for substantial increase of yield and decrease of synthesis time compared to current methods (activity yield 14.5 &#177; 0.5%, 70 min synthesis time).</dc:description>

      <title>Endocyclic Enamides Derived from Aza&#8208;Diketopiperazines as Olefin Partners in Povarov Reaction: An Access to Tetracyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Original endocyclic enamides based on a bicyclic aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP) structure have been used as dienophile partners in the Povarov reaction. The reported method represents a successful strategy for the structural diversification of the aza&#8208;DKP scaffold, giving access to a new family of fused tetracyclic&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocycles, which contain at least four nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure. Depending on the nature of the aldehyde partner, the cycloadditions have been performed either as a two&#8208;component or a three&#8208;component reaction (2CR or 3CR), in the presence of BF  3  &#160;as a Lewis acid catalyst. With aliphatic aldehydes the reaction proceeds with high diastereoselectivities in favor of the cis compounds. Some mechanistic aspects of this cycloaddition have been examined computationally.</dc:description>

      <title>Syntheses and applications of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles: A decade review</title>
      <dc:description>Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents as an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This thriving scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the enabling strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulphur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents as an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This thriving scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the enabling strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulphur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Homocoupling reactions of benzylamines and benzyl alcohols were examined under synergistic catalysis conditions with a photoredox catalyst and thiobenzoic acid as a hydrogen atom abstractor. When pivalaldehyde was used as an electron acceptor, oxidative dimerization proceeded selectively, whereas the use of benzaldehydes or iminium ions as electron acceptors resulted in redox&#8208;neutral coupling.

      <title>Boc&#8208;protection on L&#8208;DOPA: an easy way to promote underwater adhesion</title>
      <dc:description>Mussels&#8217; ability to adhere to underwater surfaces has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. As proteins containing L&#8208;DOPA (3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine) are involved in mussels&#8217; adhesion, a common strategy to synthesize adhesives is the incorporation of this amino acid into other compounds. Here we report a study on four compounds of the family of Boc  x  &#8208;(L&#8208;DOPA)  n  &#8208;OMe (x = 1&#8208;3; n = 1,2), that we prepared through simple synthetic steps. Three of them showed the capability of underwater adhesion: while they are not adhesive in the dry phase, the adhesiveness is triggered when the dried sample is immersed in water or any aqueous solutions. The introduction of protecting groups stabilizes L&#8208;DOPA, preventing the oxidation of the catechol moiety and enhances the hydrophobicity, helping the removal of water from the surface to bind. These molecules show good adhesiveness, with different properties, so they may be all used as adhesives for different purposes. These outcomes pave the way for new set of applications for these materials as green and biocompatible adhesives.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Alkylation of Heteroaromatic Bases Using Ethyl Acetate as Alkylating Agent</title>
      <dc:description>
  The direct Csp2&#8208;Csp3 visible&#8208;light photoredox cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;heteroaromatics with ethyl acetate via the generation of 1&#8208;acetoxyethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl radical is reported. This approach also uncovers ethyl acetate as a cheap and non&#8208;conventional radical source in photoredox related organic synthesis.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An efficient room&#8208;temperature visible&#8208;light photoredox &#945;&#8208;acyloxyalkylation reaction of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, which relies on the use of ethyl acetate as a cheap and non&#8208;conventional radical source. The direct C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling was extended to a diverse set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tricyclic of N&#8208;heteroaromatics, and the optimized photoredox protocol was successfully performed on a multigram scale. The scope of the alkylating agent was also explored and a plausible mechanism was proposed, involving photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer processes.

      <dc:description>Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the territory of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science.

      <dc:description>Spurred by the remarkable biological profile of cannabinoquinoids, we have systematically investigated the periodinane oxidation of their resorcinolic precursors, discovering that the regiochemistry of oxidation, a critical maneuver for bioactivity, depends not only on the nature of the oxidant (l3&#8208; vs l5&#8208;iodanes), but also on post&#8208;oxidative prototropic&#8208; and valence tautomeric equilibria that isomerize ortho&#8208;quinones to para&#8208;quinones.

      <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (S  N  Ar) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. At current, several &#8216;types&#8217; of S  N  Ar reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein we detail the reaction of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.</dc:description>

Various approaches based on chiral pool, auxiliary&#8208;based methods, cascade, biomimetic, enzymatic and photocatalytic used in total synthesis of natural products and following the PGF&#8208;criteria over the last two years (2018&#8208;2019) have been reviewed here. These should guide sustainable natural products synthesis in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Ugi three&#8208;component reaction; a valuable tool in modern organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The Ugi three component reaction (U&#8208;3CR) is a variation of the famous Ugi reaction, discovered almost 60 years ago. Today it is somehow neglected, compared to the classical variation, although the derived from the reaction &#945;&#8208;aminoamides have been utilized as inhibitors for various targets and even commercial drugs, offering improved pharmacokinetic properties. In this review, we are describing the scope and limitations of the reaction with a special focus on the developed catalytic protocols, the bioactive compounds and drugs which are based on the reaction and finally the post modifications that have been reported in order to access drug&#8208;like and privileged scaffolds. A special focus is given to the 3D solid state conformations of the U&#8208;3CR derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp.

The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Chemistry of Isocyanides with Activated Methylene Group</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview covers the know literature on [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of activated methylene isocyanides published since 2015. The review is divided into the three major parts that refer to the three heterocycles which can be prepared by reactions of isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  This review is devoted to the recent advances in the chemistry of methylene isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds. In this paper, we show a variety of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions for isocyanides, carried out both under catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic conditions. In addition, we also focused on diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity data.

     alt="Recent Advances in the Chemistry of Isocyanides with Activated Methylene Group"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This minireview covers the know literature on [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of activated methylene isocyanides published since 2015. The review is divided into the three major parts that refer to the three heterocycles which can be prepared by reactions of isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This review is devoted to the recent advances in the chemistry of methylene isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds. In this paper, we show a variety of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions for isocyanides, carried out both under catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic conditions. In addition, we also focused on diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studies towards pyridine based N,N,O&#8208;gold(III) complexes synthesis, characterization and application.</title>
      <dc:description>Gold(III) coordination of new chiral polydentate (  N,)N,O  &#8208;pyridine based ligands is reported. Successful coordination afforded novel chiral  N,N,O  &#8208;tridentate Au(III) complexes with the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;6&#8208;(  1S,2S,5R  )&#8208;neomenthol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;pyridine ligand (  1  H,  13  C,  15  N NMR, HRMS, IR, XRD).&#160;The chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;6&#8208;alkylpyridine alcohol ligands were prepared from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine by initial stereoselective addition to (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;camphor, respectively, and subsequent Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling with a series arylboronic acids. Testing of catalytic activity in propargyl cyclopropanation demonstrated that the new  N,N,O  &#8208;ligated gold(III) complex was highly catalytic active and outperformed AuCl  3  .</dc:description>
