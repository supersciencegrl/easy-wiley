         <title>Acidic DESs as Active Media for a Sustainable Synthesis of Biindoles Starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Diaminotolanes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an alternative and more sustainable method for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted 3,3&#8242;&#8209;biindoles starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diaminotolanes and (hetero)arylaldehydes. The key feature of the approach is the use of an acidic DES able to exploit a double activity, i.e. solvent and BA catalyst, avoiding the use of VOCs as solvents and additional acid catalysts. By this way, we synthesized twenty&#8208;five biindoles, including eighteen new compounds. The reactions run quickly under mild conditions by microwave heating at 70 &#176;C, with yields ranging from good to very good. The reaction scope is rather broad. The medium demonstrated to be reusable at least five times with only a slight reduction in yields. Based on experimental evidence and previous literature findings, a plausible mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoacidity of Indolinospirobenzopyrans in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolinospirobenzopyrans in their open protonated form constitute the archetype of &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221;, as they can release protons persistently and reversibly following visible light absorption. In this Review, we survey their wide&#8208;spread applicability by contextualizing the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release in water.







Abstract
The reversible isomerism of indolinospirobenzopyrans is perhaps among the most studied phenomena in the field of molecular switches. Although they began to gain attention as early as 70&#8197;years ago following the seminal work of Hirshberg and Fischer, who were the first to recognize their photochromic behaviours, their implementation as photoacids emerged prominently only in the last decade. In this Review, we contextualize the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release that occurs in these molecular switches, highlighting the most recent advances in their characterization and application as &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221; in water.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric total synthesis of two sesquiterpenoids, (&#8208;)&#8208;HM&#8208;3 and (&#8208;)&#8208;HM&#8208;4, isolated from phytopathogenic fungus has been developed using as key step a gold&#8208;catalyzed [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium. During this transformation, an excellent chirality transfer was observed between the chiral sulfoxide substrate and the newly formed quaternary stereogenic center, with 96% enantiomeric excess. The implementation of this efficient methodology allowed to isolate the two natural products in only 7&#8208;8 chemical steps with overall yields reaching 12&#8208;16%.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Reductive Cleavage of an Oxygen&#8208;Containing Naphthyl Macrocycle</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthyl&#8208;ether based macrocycle suffers multiple C&#8722;O cleavages under chemical reduction. The structures of the macrocycle and the resulting negatively charged fragment are analyzed in detail including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.







Abstract
A small macrocycle comprising ether&#8208;bridged naphthyl units was prepared in a two&#8208;step synthesis. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of two polymorphs are reported, one of which showed multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;naphthyl interactions of a solvent molecule in the cavity of the macrocycle. Chemical reduction led to C&#8722;O bond cleavages accompanied by a Z/E isomerization. The resulting twofold negatively charged (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;naphthyl)ethylene fragment was isolated as its potassium salts. Electronic characterization revealed a singlet ground state, and a marked distortion of the central ethylene unit was observed upon electron uptake.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of [b]&#8208;Annulated Azepane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters are submitted to olefin cross metathesis and subsequent exhaustive hydrogenation and reductive amination to furnish [b]&#8208;annulated azepane derivatives.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;, benzo&#8208;, and cyclohepta[b]&#8208;annulated azepane scaffolds were prepared in two steps from optically active cyclic &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters. The first step was ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed olefin cross metathesis with acrylonitrile. The second step was palladium&#8208;catalyzed dihydrogenation which consists of three consecutive processes: The hydrogenation of the C&#8722;C double and C&#8722;N triple bonds was followed by the reductive amination via the iminium ion formed in situ from the primary amino function and the endocyclic carbonyl group. This last step gave, stereoselectively, the annulated azepanes with relative trans&#8208;configuration. The amino function and the ester group define two points for further diversification of the scaffolds. The trifluoroacetyl derivatives allowed to establish the enantiopurity of the products to be 97&#8211;98&#8201;% ee by GLC on a chiral phase. The relative trans&#8208;configurations and in one case also the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration was established by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

The relative &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;configurations and in one case also the absolute (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-configuration was established by X-ray crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Front Cover visually represents our review &#8220;The Last Fortress of Tin&#8242;s Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes&#8220;. &#8221;Once upon a time, in a small corner of a faraway land full of nitroalkanes, a small town called &#8220;Protodenitrations&#8221; started coming to life. Unfortunately, a sneaky tin, hungry for power, soon took the opportunity and overtook the small, still fragile community, establishing himself as the king. The kingdom ruled by Tin The Tyrant has expanded since then, spreading its roots all over the continent. Despite a few attempts to dethrone the Tyrant, he remains undefeated. However, rumors are starting to spread that an army of reagents is beginning to gather. Could the end of the last fortress of the tyranny of tin be in sight?&#8220; This review provides the historical development and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8211;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin&#8242;s tyranny.&#8221; The authors would like to thank Katar&#237;na&#8197;R.

         <title>Chiral Amine Catalyzed Reductive Aldol/Reductive Michael Addition Cascade Towards Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzannulated Diquinanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amine catalyzed intramolecular reductive Michael addition cascade to a keto&#8208;bis&#8208;enone is reported. Enantio&#8208; (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and diastereoselective benzannulated diquinanes were obtained with three consecutive stereocenters, includes an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Interestingly, reactivity switching was observed on changing a tether connecting the ketone and an enone moiety.







Abstract
Disclosed here an amine&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol&#8208;condensation followed by an intramolecular reductive Michael&#8208;addition cascade employing Hantzsch ester as hydride source to a keto&#8208;bis&#8208;enone to provide enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective benzannulated diquinanes having three consecutive stereocenters, one of which is an all&#8208;carbon quaternary formyl stereocenter. Interestingly, on changing a tether connecting the ketone and an enone moiety from an aliphatic to an aromatic, a change in reactivity is observed. In this case, instead of the above&#8208;mentioned reductive aldol condensation, an asymmetric aldol reaction occurs, followed by an iminium/enamine isomerization and, finally diastereoselective Michael addition reaction occurs. As a result, a bis&#8208;benzannulated diquinane is obtained with vicinal congested quaternary chiral centers.

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical borylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and allenoates is described. In an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, a panel of Michael acceptors and allenoates was readily reacted. The reaction was efficient and the products were obtained in good to excellent yields (20&#8197;examples, 47&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% yield), offering an access to versatile borylated building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis of Phosphate Esters by Using Diphenyl Ditelluride as Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an approach to prepare phosphate esters by a dehydrogenative phosphorylation reaction between functionalized naphthols and H&#8208;phosphonates using diphenyl ditelluride as an organocatalyst and sonochemistry as an alternative energy source. The method was also suitable to the use &#945;&#8208;naphthol, &#946;&#8208;naphthol, phenol and thiophenol.







Abstract
We report a protocol for the synthesis of new dialkyl(1&#8208;(organolthio)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphates and derivatives via a dehydrogenative phosphorylation reaction between functionalized naphthols and H&#8208;phosphonates. Diphenyl ditelluride was employed as an organocatalyst and sonochemistry as an alternative energy source. The reaction conditions were defined through a factorial design approach, and the best condition provided the synthesis of dialkyl(1&#8208;(organolthio)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphates in yields that varied from 51&#8211;98&#8201;% under ultrasound irradiation after 2&#8197;h of sonication. The synthetic protocol was also effective for phenol and thiophenol starting materials. All products were characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques.

         <title>Regioselective Alkynylation of Allylic Phosphates with Alkynyl Copper Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a regioselective alkynylation of allylic phosphates with alkynyl copper reagents. The reaction gave 1,4&#8208;enynes independent of steric hindrance or electronic effects of the substrate or nucleophile. Then, we efficiently synthesized intermediates in the synthesis of lipid metabolites using this reaction.







Abstract
We developed an alkynylation of allylic phosphates with acetylenes in the presence of copper and magnesium salts. The reaction proceeded regioselectively to afford the corresponding 1,4&#8208;enynes. Furthermore, the functional group tolerance of this reaction was established. As an application, the 1,4&#8208;enyne intermediate involved in the synthesis of 13R,19S,20S&#8208;trihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid could be efficiently synthesized.

&lt;p&gt;We developed an alkynylation of allylic phosphates with acetylenes in the presence of copper and magnesium salts. The reaction proceeded regioselectively to afford the corresponding 1,4-enynes. Furthermore, the functional group tolerance of this reaction was established. As an application, the 1,4-enyne intermediate involved in the synthesis of 13&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,19&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,20&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-trihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid could be efficiently synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.

         <dc:description>
A surfur ylide&#8208;mediated rearrangement reaction of a functionalized Ugi adduct produced polysubstituted dibenzo[b,e]azepin&#8208;6(11H)&#8208;ones in good overall yields under mild one&#8208;pot reaction condition.







Abstract
A new one&#8208;pot preparation of dibenzo[b,e]azepin&#8208;6(11H)&#8208;one by a sequential Ugi&#8208;4CR and surfur ylide&#8208;mediated rearrangement reaction has been developed. A series of polysubstituted dibenzo[b,e]azepin&#8208;6(11H)&#8208;ones were obtained in 69&#8211;84&#8201;% yields from readily available sulfonium salts, 2&#8208;aminophenyl ketones, aldehydes and isocyanides in the presence of DBU.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent 2&#8208;Aminopurine Derivatives: synthesis, photophysical characterization, and preliminary cytotoxicity evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) are emerging as extraordinarily useful tools for DNA labelling technologies. The highly fluorescent adenine analogue 2&#8209;aminopurine (2AP) is still the most used within the few hundreds of newly FBAs synthesized, but its excitation in the UV region demands for high energy sources endangering living cells. New and highly fluorescent 2AP derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines, were obtained using novel, simpler, but very efficient synthesis method. All the new compounds exhibit advantageous photophysical properties over 2AP, showing absorption and emission bands ranging the visible region (blue&#8208;green region), high fluorescence quantum yields and Stokes shifts, especially in non&#8208;protic organic solvents. Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT) of electronic and vibrational structure were performed, allowing to predict absorption and emission spectra in accordance with experimental data. The extensive solvatochromism of compounds gives them important microenvironmental sensitivity to be used as superior fluorescent probes, comparing to 2AP. In addition, these newly synthesized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines exhibit little to no toxicity in assays using yeast cells, making them also valuable candidates for fluorescent studies in living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Acylindoles with different substituents in positions N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;2 were successfully synthesized by cyclization of o&#8208;substituted N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;acylamides by photochemically induced 1,3&#8208;acyl shift.







Abstract
A photochemical cyclization of F&#8208;tagged, o&#8208;alkynylated N&#8208;alkylamides to indoles catalyzed by [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbpy)]PF6 is presented. This straightforward and efficient reaction involves an intramolecular rearrangement due to the presence of an electron withdrawing group in the acyl moiety and is the first example of photochemically induced 1,3&#8208;acyl shift in the cyclization towards 3&#8208;acylindoles. A four&#8208;step reaction sequence including the photoreaction as a key step to the desired indoles has been developed and optimized. The compatibility of differently substituted F&#8208;tagged precursors with the photocyclization step was investigated and the robustness of this step towards modifications could be shown. In total, 16 so far unknown derivatives with diverse modifications in positions N1 and C2, bearing a pentadecafluorooctanoyl moiety as F&#8208;tag, were synthesized in very good yields and fully characterized.

         <dc:description>
The CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes is an enantio&#8208; and regioselective approach for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing compounds. DFT calculations were used to explore the mechanisms and origins of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity of CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes.







Abstract
The CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes is an enantio&#8208; and regioselective approach for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing compounds. With density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity and regioselectivity. The hydrocarboxylation proceeds through the migratory insertion of allenes on CuH complex, the enantioselective addition of fluoroformate, and the &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination gives the branched carboxylation products. The electron&#8208;donating alkyl and phenyl groups in the allene polarize the C=C bond and thus lead to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective migratory insertion. In addition, the enantioselective addition of fluoroformate by either (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;addition determines the enantioselectivity. The (S)&#8208;addition is more favorable due to the bulky &#8722;tBu group of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS ligand, which prefers keeping the C=C bond of allene away from the reaction center in six&#8208;membered transition state and thus results in (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing products.

         <title>Cationic Symmetrically and Unsymmetrically Substituted Diboranes and Bis(diboranes) with Direct Boron&#8208;Boron Bond: Synthesis by Substitution, Stability and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for the directed synthesis of unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes are established; the kinetics of substitution of the triflato group in monocationic triflato&#8208;diboranes is controlled by the properties of the neutral Lewis base bound to the second boron atom.







Abstract
Starting with diboranes with two electron&#8208;rich bridging bicyclic guanidinate substituents, we report in this work the rational synthesis of new dicationic symmetrically&#8208; and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes in SN1&#8208;type substitution reactions in which triflato or bromo substituents are replaced by neutral Lewis bases. The scope of such substitution reactions and their rate are analyzed with different pyridine derivatives of variable Lewis basicity. The first substitution step, leading to a monocationic diborane with one anionic substituent (triflate or bromide) and one neutral Lewis base, proceeds much faster than the second substitution step leading to a dicationic diborane with two neutral Lewis bases. The different time scales for the substitution steps could be used to conveniently synthesize in one&#8208;pot reactions several dicationic, unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes with two different neutral Lewis bases.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Allylation of Azadienes with Allyltrimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free 1,4&#8208;allylation of azadienes with allyltrimethylsilanes catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 has been developed for the first time to afford benzofuran&#8208;, indene&#8208;, dihydronaphthalene&#8208;, chromene&#8208;, and benzothiophene&#8208;based allyl arylmethanes.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free 1,4&#8208;allylation of azadienes with allyltrimethylsilanes catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 has been developed. The high Lewis acidity, good thermal stability, and good hydrolytic stability of the catalyst make this reaction efficient and operationally simple. In contrast to the previously reported 1,2&#8208;allylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines, the 1,4&#8208;allylation of azadienes is described here for the first time. Benzofuran&#8208;, indene&#8208;, dihydronaphthalene&#8208;, chromene&#8208;, and benzothiophene&#8208;based allyl arylmethanes have been obtained in up to 95&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic Alcohols Mediated by Iodobenzene Dichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and inexpensive Willgerodt's reagent (iodobenzene dichloride) was found to realize &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation of aliphatic primary alcohols under visible light. Willgerodt's reagent acted as a selective hydrogen atom transfer reagent and oxidant at the same time for the metal&#8208; and additional acid&#8208;free Minisci type cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
With the irradiation of visible light, &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation of aliphatic alcohol was selectively achieved under gentle conditions in the present of iodobenzene dichloride. The Minisci&#8208;type cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction was performed in the absence of metal and acid. Readily available primary alcohols and electron&#8208;withdrawing heteroarenes can be applied smoothly. Mechanism studies indicated that the PhICl radical and chlorine radical formed from iodobenzene dichloride were responsible for the selective hydrogen atom abstraction of alcohols.

         <title>HFO&#8208;1234yf as a CF3 Building Block: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Quinoline and Chromene Derivatives from Trifluoromethyl&#8208;ynones</title>

Trifluoromethyl ynones derived from the refrigerant HFO&#8208;1234yf undergo a tandem Michael addition&#8208;cyclisation reaction with 2&#8208;amino or 2&#8208;hydroxyaryl carbonyls to form 2&#8208;trifluoromethylquinolines and 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxychromenes, respectively, in a single step. Thus generating pharmaceutically relevant structures from an inexpensive feed&#8208;stock.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl ynones derived from the refrigerant gas HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene) react with nucleophiles via a Michael&#8208;type addition process and the allenolate intermediate formed reacts intramolecularly with a carbonyl group to form heterocyclic derivatives. Thus, reaction of 2&#8208;amino and 2&#8208;hydroxyl benzaldehyde or ketone substrates with trifluoromethyl ynone derivatives gives trifluoromethyl quinoline and chromene products by a one&#8208;pot tandem ring closing sequence, forming pharmaceutically relevant structures from an inexpensive starting material without the need for transition metals or column chromatography. The 2&#8208;trifluoromethylquinoline products also show unusual fluxional behaviour, which was explored through 2&#8208;D NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.

         <title>Tailoring the Chemical Structure of Cellulose Nanocrystals by Amine Functionalization</title>

The surface amination of cellulose nanocrystals is a powerful tool to modulate their pH, photoluminescence, or electrochemical activity. This work reports cellulose nanocrystals surface modification and a thorough analysis of their surface structure.







Abstract
The surface functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals is presently considered a useful and straightforward tool for accessing very reliable biocompatible and biodegradable nanostructures with tailored physical and chemical properties. However, to date the fine characterization of the chemical appendages introduced onto cellulose nanocrystals remains a challenge, due to the low sensitivity displayed by the most common techniques towards surface functionalization. In this paper, we demonstrate the easy functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals with aliphatic and aromatic amines, demonstrating the tunability of their properties in dependence on the selected functionality. Then, we apply to colloidal suspensions of modified nanocrystals 1H&#8197;NMR analysis to elucidate their surface structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where such investigation was performed on cellulose nanocrystals presenting both surface and reducing end modification. These results involve interesting implications for the fields of cultural heritage and of materials chemistry.

         <title>Construction of a Bifunctional Pd(0)&#8208;CALB@SiO2 Hybrid Catalyst for the Synthesis and Arylation of Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine in One Pot</title>

An enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalyst developed by encapsulating Candida antarctica lipase B and Pd(0) within silica to catalyze the sequence of Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling in one pot to produce clinically significant imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the construction of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalyst [Pd(0)&#8208;CALB@SiO2] via encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B and Pd(0) within silica. Next, the applicability of the newly constructed biohybrid was demonstrated by catalyzing the sequence of Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling in a single&#8208;pot to produce clinically significant imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives. Interestingly, both entities, i.e., CALB enzyme and Pd(0)&#8208;metal of hybrid catalyst, exhibited good catalytic activity during this approach. Further, the generality of this protocol was explored by using differently substituted boronic acid, which gave related products in 49&#8211;87&#8201;% isolated yield. Next, the synthetic utility was proved by set&#8208;up a gram scale reaction which provided the complementary product in 81&#8201;% yield. Also, the developed biohybrid was found to be reusable up to five catalytic cycles.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxazolidinones through One&#8208;Pot Coupling of Benzylamines, Epoxides and CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones are prepared through a one&#8208;pot coupling of amines, epoxides and CO2 promoted by 1,1,3,3,&#8208;tetramethylguanidine under visible light irradiation at atmospheric pressure. Computational calculations suggest the formation of [TMG&#8208;CO2] adduct as an intermediate.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones from a three component coupling reaction of amines, epoxides, and CO2. The reaction proceeds in the presence of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine under visible light irradiation at atmospheric pressure. The optimized structures of all species involved in the reaction mechanism along with transition states have been described based on the DFT calculations. The developed methodology represents a promising approach of employing CO2 as a naturally abundant and non&#8208;toxic carbon resource to produce profitable chemicals.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

The Front Cover shows a picture of a Ramen bowl, the famous Japanese noodle soup, that allegorically sketches the combination of the different aggregation states of the amphiphilic GCase pharmacological chaperone, object of our study. The slices of meat depict the solid state, while the boiled egg represents the micellar aggregates in solution (above the cmc). The noodles in the soup represent the misfolded GCase enzyme, which is stabilized by our compound as a monomer in the nM concentration range and symbolized by the spoon.

         <title>The Role of Dethreading Process in Pseudorotaxanes and Rotaxanes towards Advanced Applications: Recent Examples</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 11, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of the dethreading process in recent advanced applications of rotaxane&#8208;based systems. Indeed, the dethreading of the different interlocked counterparts turns out to be an essential feature to obtain target molecules and to accomplish some machine&#8208;like operations.







Abstract
Rotaxanes are a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), constituted by at least a thread surrounded by a wheel, which are widely employed in the research field of artificial molecular machines. Although applications retaining the integrity of the mechanical bond are usually reported, the dethreading of the components can be crucial to develop some advanced applications. Thus, different dethreading strategies have been reported, and advanced applications which require such a process have turned out to be suitable approaches towards machine&#8208;like operation. This review article covers recent examples of applications of pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes in which dethreading processes have a key role to accomplish the desired function.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Dithienopyrazines
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient preparation and investigation of so far unknown heterotriacenes, basic anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;dithienopyrazine 5 and 6 is reported. The comparison of the two isomers with respect to electronic properties and follow&#8208;up reactions gives insights into structure&#8208;property and &#8208;reactivity relationships. Examples of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions of corresponding halogenated derivatives show the practical impact for extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems applied in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Heteroacenes developed to widely used building blocks in organic semiconductors for application in organic electronics due to their tunable structures and properties concomitant with inherent stability. Here, we report efficient preparation and investigation of so far unknown heterotriacenes, basic anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;dithienopyrazine 5 and 6. The comparison of the two isomers with respect to electronic properties and follow&#8208;up reactions gives insights into structure&#8208;property and &#8208;reactivity relationships. Examples of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions of corresponding halogenated derivatives show the practical impact for extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems applied in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylation: Extended Substrate Scope and Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A self&#8208;promoted glycosylation method for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;glucosides from a substrate library of glycosyl trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors and glycosyl acceptors is presented. The simple two&#8208;component reaction takes place at elevated temperatures, without the addition of any additives or catalysts. After a simple basic workup, N&#8208;Glycosides were obtained in good yields and with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and hence this method allows for easy access to glycoconjugates under very mild conditions. The influences of neighboring group participation and substituents, in both the glycosyl donor and acceptor, were studied. Kinetic data were obtained from in situ IR and these were used for a Hammett study. A connection between the pKa of the acceptor and reaction rate was found and new mechanistic insight in self&#8208;promoted glycosylations gained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Peroxodicarbonate represents a green and largely underexplored oxidizer generated electrochemically from aqueous carbonate solutions. Through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzer technology, highly concentrated solutions have now become accessible. These were successfully employed as green oxidizer in deborolative hydroxylations. A plethora of phenols and alcohols have thus been synthesized in up to 99% from organoboron compounds using only green and non&#8208;toxic solvents This transformation was successfully scaled&#8208;up to multi&#8208;gram batch sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>White Light/NIS&#8208;Promoted Aminoselenylation of Alkenes by Using N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A white light/iodosuccinimide (NIS)&#8208;promoted three component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones and diorganyl diselenides for synthesis of organylselenylethyl sulfonylhydrazones under air is disclosed. This intermolecular aminoselenylation of alkenes using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as nitrogen source was performed under mild conditions and well tolerated for common groups. In addition, heteroaryl and aliphatic diselenides also gave the target compounds. Gram&#8208;scale reaction also carried out smoothly. This protocol has a wide range of substrates and affords moderate to high yields and excellent regioselectivities. The photoactive intermediates from the interaction between NIS and diphenyl diselenide was detected by UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra, which matches the wavelength of the applied white LED. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on UV&#8208;visible light experiments and control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies Concerned with the Proposed Structure of Ribisin F, a Compound with Nerve Growth Factor Potentiating Activity Isolated from the Medicinal Fungus Phellinus ribis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, from quinic acid, of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been accomplished but the derived spectral data do not match those reported for ribisin F. A related synthesis of its C3 epimer suggests that this may represent the true structure.







Abstract
The synthesis of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been achieved from abundant quinic acid. However, the NMR spectral data acquired on the synthetic material do not match those reported for ribisin F (which are of rather modest quality). In an effort to establish the true structure of ribisin F, an epimer of the assigned structure was also prepared from quinic acid. A comparison of the spectral data obtained on this epimer with those reported for the natural product proved a better match and based on optical rotation data the possible true structure of this distinctive, dihydroxylated and benzofuran&#8208;containing compound is tentatively proposed.

         <title>Reactivity Tuning of Metal&#8208;Free Artificial Photoenzymes through Binding Site Specific Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free artificial photoenzyme was designed based on the human steroid carrier protein (SCP&#8208;2L), which possesses a hydrophobic tunnel and facilitates substrate binding. Three variants of SCP&#8208;2L were bioconjugated with a photocatalytic moiety and used for selective oxidation of organic sulfides giving up to 192 turnovers depending on the binding side of the photocatalyst.







Abstract
The design and development of artificial metal&#8208;free photoenzymes aims to combine the selectivity of enzymatic reactions with the benefits of modern synthetic photocatalysts. Removing the need for rare earth metals and allowing for milder reaction conditions, leading to a more sustainable catalytic system. Here, we present the design of a novel artificial photoenzyme by integrating an organophotocatalytic moiety based on a donor&#8208;acceptor design into a steroid carrier protein (SCP&#8208;2L). SCP&#8208;2L possesses a hydrophobic tunnel facilitating substrate binding in aqueous media. The photocatalyst was site&#8208;selectively bound to three SCP&#8208;2L variants, possessing a non&#8208;native cysteine residue strategically placed around the hydrophobic tunnel of the protein. The three modified photoenzymes were shown to be selective for the oxidation of organic sulfides giving up to 192 turnovers.

Simple, rapid one&#8208;step oxidation of shelf&#8208;stable N&#8208;Boc&#8208; and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;Boc&#8208;diarylhydrazines with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene provides unsymmetrical diaryldiazenes, arylazopyridines and tris(arylazo)benzenes in good to excellent yields.

Abstract
A study on the oxidation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208; and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected 1,2&#8208;diarylhydrazines with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene is reported. The reactions proceed quickly in acetic acid at slightly elevated temperatures, giving diaryldiazenes in good to excellent yields. Electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are well tolerated. This synthetic protocol also applies to synthesising (aryldiazenyl)pyridines and unsymmetrical 1,3,5&#8208;tris(arylazo)benzenes.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Compounds for the Synthesis of Amines: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In synthetic chemistry and pharmacy, the reductive amination reaction is crucial because it is one of the most effective methods for forming C&#8722;N bonds. Reductive amination is a reaction that occurs when an amine or ammonia is combined with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of a reducing agent and a catalyst. For these reactions to access different amines, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been successfully developed. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Reductive amination is a valuable method for amine synthesis that has been the topic of a century&#8216;s worth of in&#8208;depth study in both academia and industry. Amines and their derivatives serve as incredibly adaptable building blocks for a broad array of organic substrates and are significant precursors for a myriad of advanced chemicals, physiologically active compounds, agrochemicals, biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. The creation of innovative catalytic processes for the long&#8208;term and selective synthesis of amines from readily accessible and environmentally benign reagents remains a top priority in chemical research. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been designed with success to enable these reactions to explore new amines. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency. This review comprehensively overviews the Ru&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination processes and includes the literature from 2009 to 2022.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Pyridine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Molecules: Recent Strategies and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mind the gap! A practical guide to navigate through the complex network of selective late&#8208;stage functionalisations of pyridine&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation (LSF) is an innovative technique that has been successfully applied to the C&#8722;H diversification of pharmaceuticals. However, LSF of the pyridine ring in drug&#8208;like molecules is often unselective. As a result, a mixture of structurally related products is obtained, thus making the purification tedious and time&#8208;consuming. This review shines a light on recent strategies addressing the selectivity issue in the LSF of complex natural products or drugs containing the pyridine moiety. Specifically, we have reviewed the efforts reported both in academia and industries with the hope of providing a guide for the LSF of elaborated pyridines.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Chemiluminescent Cassettes Based on Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a new strategy to obtain near infrared emitting (NIR) chemiluminescent probes. The synthesis of green&#8208; or NIR&#8208;emitting chemiluminescent cassettes was achieved. Their photophysical study proved that efficient energy transfer occurs even in the absence of a favourable spectral overlap between the emission of the chemiluminescent platform and the tethered fluorophore.







Abstract
Chemiluminescent probes are being considered as a convenient option for optical imaging. Several strategies were reported to increase the probe chemiluminescence efficiency. In this study, a series of chemiluminescent cassettes based on adamantyl stabilized 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes (&#8220;Schaap's dioxetane&#8221;) linked to a fluorophore (BODIPY or dicyanoisophorone fluorophore) by a conjugated linker have been synthetized. Their chemiluminescent decomposition and the photoluminescence properties of their respective emissive species were investigated.

An oxidative C&#8722;H bond annulation of 2 arylquinoxalines with cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones has been developed for the synthesis of polycyclic quinoxaline frameworks. This method involves C&#8722;H bond activation and double C&#8722;C bond formation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;amykitanosyl tetramic acid derivative, Li's synthetic intermediate for the antibiotic amycolamicin, has been synthesized via stereoconvergent lactamization of a cyclic carbonate&#8208;protected N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine ester, prepared from l&#8208;fucose more efficiently than before, and opening of the carbonate ring with lithium dibenzylamide to regioselectively install a carbamate functionality.

An improved five&#8208;step synthetic route from l&#8208;fucose to an N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine methyl ester has been developed. The new route involves glycosidation of l&#8208;fucose with phenol in a &#946;&#8208;selective manner without protection/deprotection steps and one&#8208;pot stereochemical inversion of a secondary alcohol intermediate and is superior to our previous one both in the number of steps and in overall yield. An N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine benzyl ester, prepared from l&#8208;fucose in an analogous way, has been elaborated into an N&#8208;amykitanosyl tetramic acid derivative, Li's synthetic intermediate for amycolamicin, via a four&#8208;step sequence which features the utilization of Bestmann's ylide to stereoconvergently construct an N&#8208;glycosyl tetramic acid intermediate in a single step, opening of a cyclic carbonate ring with an amine to regioselectively install a carbamate functionality, and visible light&#8208;mediated oxidative debenzylation of an N,N&#8208;dibenzyl carbamate.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 11H&#8208;Indolo[3,2&#8208;c]quinolines and Neocryptolepine from a Common Starting Material</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common intermediate gives easy access to both neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine analogues in up to 80&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% yield, respectively.







Abstract
A large number of diversely functionalized analogs of the bioactive natural products neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine have been prepared from a series of 3&#8208;bromoquinoline derivatives. The neocryptolepines were obtained by a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling followed by C&#8722;N bond formation in yields up to 80&#8201;%, whereas the indoloquinolines were prepared by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling followed by azidation&#8208;photochemical cyclization in yields ranging from traces to 95&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Transformations: Rapid Access to Amines, Alkyl Halides, and Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient photocatalytic strategy for the decarboxylative transformations of redox&#8208;active esters to construct C=C, C(sp3)&#8211;N, and C(sp3)&#8208;X bonds in a single&#8208;step. This operationally simple method provides a straightforward access to a variety of protected alkyl amines, alkyl halides and olefins under mild conditions in the absence of metals and photocatalysts. The method can successfully be applied to primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicate that the charge transfer complex (CTC) was formed by  n Bu4NI with redoxactive esters, in which the  n Bu4NI acted as both an iodine source and an efficient electron donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium Acetate Catalyzed Formation of 1,5&#8208;Benzodiazepines through [4+2+1] Cycloaddition Involving 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium acetate in ethanol is a clean and efficient protocol for the multicomponent construction of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines, being an appropriately mild catalyst in the case of the acid&#8208;sensitive biobased platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF). The protocol is tolerant to many functional groups in substituted diamines, alkynones or alkyl alkynoates, and furanic aldehydes.







Abstract
The use of the renewable platform molecule 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) in multi&#8208;component reaction with a diamine and an alkynone to generate seven&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines is described. Due to the sensitivity of 5&#8208;HMF to strong acidic and basic conditions, the investigation required an in&#8208;depth revisit of reaction parameters as compared to benchmark aldehydes. Among catalysts/solvents couples, ammonium acetate in ethanol proved to be a clean and efficient system. These optimized conditions were subsequently used to investigate the scope of the reaction providing a library of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in moderate to good yields from a wide range of diversely substituted diamines and alkynones or alkyl alkynoates.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and straightforward protocol for accessing a new series of functionalized 4&#8208;aminocoumarins from PIDA/I2&#8208;mediated decarboxylative C4&#8208;amination of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids via direct Csp2&#8211;H dehydrogenative C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling with secondary amines under ambient conditions has been accomplished.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208; or UVA&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hydroxamic Acids from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208; or UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of hydroxamic acids from carboxylic acids and protected hydroxylamines is reported, the key step of which is the formation of a charge transfer complex. Mechanistic studies by DI&#8208;HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates. Two hydroxamic drugs (Vorinostat and Bufexamac) were synthesized.







Abstract
The development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications is increasingly attracting high interest. We present herein a new photochemical protocol for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids, which constitute an important class of medicinal agents, mainly due to their anticancer properties. The method is mediated by UVA&#8208;light or sunlight and its key point is the generation of a charge transfer complex by the interaction of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine with a halomethane. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled with O&#8208;protected hydroxylamines, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or solar light. A detailed study of the mechanism was carried out by the employment of direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8208;HRMS), providing experimental evidence for the formation of various activated species, which may lead to the desired product. The light&#8208;mediated protocol was applied in the synthesis of the drugs Vorinostat and Bufexamac.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Camptothecin&#8208;like Scaffolds: Construction of a New Class of Pseudo&#8208;natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NP) strategy has become one of the most important tools to deliver biologically significant chemical probes. In this article, we describe the development of a new class of pseudo&#8208;NP collection that led to the synthesis of camptothecin&#8208;like analogues. This process is driven by a cascade that unites Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with Michael addition reaction, followed by oxidative&#8208;ring enlargement and subsequent transannular aldol cyclization delivering camptothecin&#8208;like architectures.







Abstract
The discovery of novel small molecules endowed with high 3D&#8208;content remains a powerful tool for interrogating underrepresented biological space. To this end, the pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NP) strategy has become one of the most important tools to deliver biologically significant chemical probes. In this article, we describe the development of a new class of pseudo&#8208;NP collection, through connecting tryptamines with a furanose derivative followed by subjecting the product from this operation to a ring distortion strategy that led to diastereoselective synthesis of camptothecin&#8208;like compounds. This process is driven by a cascade that unites Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with Michael addition reaction, followed by oxidative&#8208;ring enlargement and subsequent transannular aldol cyclization delivering camptothecin&#8208;like architectures. The obtained diastereoselectivity was verified using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Reactions in Endohedral&#8208;Functionalized Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of enhanced functionalization is a key&#160;aspect in the current design of cage chemistry. At the moment,&#160;several approaches are intensively investigated. The synthesis of&#160;cage compounds that display endohedral functionalization plays a key&#160;role among them. Here, the studies of reactions that occur in&#160;endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds is reviewed. After an&#160;introduction in current trends in cage&#8208;chemistry the discussion of&#160;reactions in endohedral&#8208;cage compounds is divided into three&#160;sections. These are: 1) Endohedral groups that are by themselves&#160;functional, 2) endohedral groups that can bind to a transition&#8208;metal&#160;complex and 3) endohedral groups that can bind by themselves to a&#160;metal. The article closes with an outlook on additional current&#160;developments in the field of endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds,&#160;which may contribute in the future towards reactivity in&#160;cage compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Dance on 2&#8208;Iodobenzofuran and 2&#8208;Iodobenzothiophene and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New derivatives of benzofuran and benzothiophene were synthesized by halogen dance from the 2&#8208;iodinated precursors. In addition, our efforts to deprotometallate 2&#8208;substituted (SiR3, CH(OH)R) benzofurans and benzothiophenes at the 7&#8208;position are reported.







Abstract
When 2&#8208;iodobenzofuran was treated sequentially with lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and an aldehyde, the 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;iodobenzofuran resulting from the halogen dance was the only isolated product. However, from 2&#8208;iodobenzothiophene, these conditions led to mixtures in which the 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;iodobenzothiophene was always accompanied by the 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophene. The use of 2&#8208;bromobenzothiophene as a catalyst made it possible to significantly reduce this competitive dehalogenation. To confirm the halogen dance reaction, the products were unambiguously synthesized by using direct halogenations and deprotolithiation&#8208;trapping sequences as key steps. Our efforts to access 2,7&#8208;disubstituted and 7&#8208;substituted derivatives of benzofuran and benzothiophene have also been reported.

         <title>Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling in the Preparation of Benzyl Substituted Pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine Based CSF1R Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CSF1R is a protein kinase emerging as an attractive target with medicinal chemistry. Guided by molecular docking a series of pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor candidates have been synthesis using Negishi and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the key steps. The front runner compounds possessed excellent enzymatic potency, and preferably binds to the autoinhibited form of CSF1R.







Abstract
The colony&#8208;stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a protein kinase emerging as an attractive target with clinical relevance in cancer, CNS and inflammatory diseases. Molecular docking experiments followed by synthesis and structure&#8211;activity relationship have been used to identify low molecular weight structures as promising hits for lead optimization. These molecules are synthesized from a 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;6&#8208;iodo&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine building block using Negishi and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in high yields. Several inhibitors possessed excellent enzymatic potency, and the parent compound preferably binds to the autoinhibited form of CSF1R.

&lt;p&gt;CSF1R is a protein kinase emerging as an attractive target with medicinal chemistry. Guided by molecular docking a series of pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor candidates have been synthesis using Negishi and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling in the key steps. The front runner compounds possessed excellent enzymatic potency, and preferably binds to the autoinhibited form of CSF1R.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a protein kinase emerging as an attractive target with clinical relevance in cancer, CNS and inflammatory diseases. Molecular docking experiments followed by synthesis and structure&#8211;activity relationship have been used to identify low molecular weight structures as promising hits for lead optimization. These molecules are synthesized from a 4-chloro-6-iodo-pyrrolo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidine building block using Negishi and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in high yields. Several inhibitors possessed excellent enzymatic potency, and the parent compound preferably binds to the autoinhibited form of CSF1R. Cellular and in vivo profiling indicate that further tuning of drug structure is needed prior to efficacy studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation of Indole via In Situ Generated Indol&#8208;2&#8208;one</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indole derivatives with in situ generated indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones from functionalized 3&#8208;bromooxinidoles to construct 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8217;&#8208;indolyloxindole skeleton catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(BF4)2 has been developed, which enabled the formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;folicanthine.







Abstract
An asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indole with in situ generated indol&#8208;2&#8208;one from functionalized 3&#8208;bromooxinidole catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(BF4)2 has been developed. This protocol provides an efficient route to stereoselective construction of a series of 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8217;&#8208;indolyloxindoles bearing a quaternary carbon center in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, the conversion of the resulted 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8217;&#8208;indolyloxindole to the key intermediate for the formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;folicanthine was also demonstrated.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Triarylamines and Poly(triarylamine)s through a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular synthesis of triarylamines and poly(triarylamine)s has been achieved by using diarylamines and electron&#8208;rich arenes as the building blocks. Through the modulation of reaction temperatures, the stepwise assembly of bis&#8208;triarylamines could be realized efficiently. Furthermore, the multiple aminated polyphenols were rapidly constructed by a single step. This method should find applications in the synthesis of triarylamine&#8208;type photocatalysts and optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
A modular protocol for the triarylamine synthesis has been developed using diarylamines and electron&#8208;rich arenes, such as phenols, as the building blocks. The KI/KIO4 system proves to be highly efficient for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of phenothiazines/phenoxazines with phenols/anilines. A wide range of functional groups attached to both coupling partners were well tolerated. Through the manipulation of reaction temperatures, the sequential assembly of bis&#8208;triarylamines could be achieved to provide the unsymmetrically bis&#8208;aminated phenols efficiently. Furthermore, the multiple aminated polyphenols were rapidly constructed in good to high yields by a single operation.

All six cyano&#173;borane adducts have been characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The reduction of the cyanoborane adducts has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and the Lewis acidity of the different cyanoboranes has been assessed using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. Selected experimental data and trends are compared to theoretical ones, e.g. fluoride ion affinities (FIAs).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines, having diverse reactivity profile, have been exploited as versatile reaction partners in synthetic organic chemistry. This review comprehensively highlights the advancement made in asymmetric catalysis employing various chemically and structurally distinct conjugated imines/azadienes.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds have consistently been a noticeable center of attention due to their significant utilization in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines or conjugated imines provide a lot of significant cyclic as well as acyclic products through reacting with a versatile family of compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in enantioselective reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines by using synthetic methodologies for synthesizing various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that contain four to six&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of rarely found seven&#8208;, eight&#8208; and nine&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles have also been reported.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Seiricuprolide and Pestalotioprolide B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first and convergent total syntheses of seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B, 14&#8208;membered macrolides bearing a chiral epoxide moiety. The key synthetic features include OH&#8208;directed m&#8208;CPBA epoxidation, selective reduction of propargylic alcohol, acetylide addition and Shiina macrolactonization. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship study suggests that the &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety suppresses cytotoxic activity on HCT116 colon cancer cells and CFTR inhibitory effect of both macrolides.







Abstract
The first total syntheses of seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B, rare 14&#8208;membered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated macrolides embedding a chiral epoxide motif, were achieved in 17 steps with 1.9&#8201;% and 1.6&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. Our synthesis featured the key Shiina macrolactonization to construct the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic skeleton, Wittig olefination to generate the (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester and selective reduction of advanced chiral propargylic alcohol intermediate to enable the exclusive formation of Z&#8208; or E&#8208;olefin at C8&#8722;C9. Synthetic seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against the HCT116 colon cancer cell line as well as their inhibitory effect on CFTR chloride channel activity in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship suggested that the C5&#8722;C6 &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety suppressed both biological activities.

         <title>Selective Radical Transformations with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since 1858, aryldiazonium salts have been inspiring chemists to use them as dye precursors and as substrates for ionic or radicalar transformations. The latter is experiencing a renaissance among the reliable methodologies in chemical synthesis due to the discovery of catalysts and reaction protocols. Herein, these modern examples were compiled to highlight the general methods to produce aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts in route to complexes arylated molecules.







Abstract
This review provides an overview of the use of aryldiazonium salts as the source of aryl radicals and their application in the development of selective transformations over the last 13&#8197;years. Examples were organized under thermal and photocatalytic transformations. This review provides an accessible follow&#8208;up in this field for both radical and catalytic chemists working in industry as well as academia.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective construction of glycosidic linkages have emerged as one of the pivotal aspects for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharide assemblies. We herein report C2&#8208;cyanomethyl (CNMe) ether as a strong stereodirecting group on trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides. The developed donors bearing various arming and disarming protections along with C2&#8208;CNMe ether delivered the glycosides in short reaction time, moderate to good yields and high to excellent stereoselectivities. Gluco&#8208; and galacto&#8208; configured donors were found compatible with an array of alcohols having varied reactivities. The orthogonality of the CNMe ether protection with silyl ether group has been further explored for sequential glycosylations.</dc:description>

         <title>Co(Salox)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily accessible Salox ligands in combination with cobalt were found to be competent catalysts for the asymmetric conjugate reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, and nitriles with NaBH4 To give enantioselectivity up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er and quantitative yields. Preliminary experiments highlight a relatively complex reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Co&#8208;Salox complexes are suitable catalysts for the reduction of prochiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. These ligands can be prepared in a single step from available and inexpensive materials, thus representing an easily accessible alternative to previously reported Co&#8208;catalysts. NaBH4 is employed as reducing agent in the presence of EtOH as proton source, leading to the stereoselective formation of chiral esters, amides, and nitriles in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er. The concentration of the reductant counter cation (Na+) and the solvent polarity have been shown to correlate with reactivity and enantioselectivity, suggesting that a relatively complex mechanistic manifold is in place.

         <title>Towards Green Reductions in Bio&#8208;Derived Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of unsaturated compounds is a powerful tool employed in almost all multistep syntheses. The present Review highlights the recent developments achieved in the field of sustainable reductions of organic compounds in green media: from the traditional direct hydrogenation with heterogenous metal&#8208;catalysts to the transfer hydrogenation strategy all methodologies reported have been performed in bio&#8208;solvents that can be derived from renewable natural sources.







Abstract
The hydrogenation processes, and all the reactions that formally add two hydrogen atoms to an unsaturated bond, are among the most used transformations in the manufacture of bulk and fine chemicals. Although their potential as powerful tool for the sustainable synthesis of organic compounds, hydrogenations, and more generally the reductions, have been typically carried out in volatile organic solvents deriving from petroleum; indeed, all studies and fascinating advances related to the catalysts&#8217; activity or the reducing agents&#8217; reactivity have been limited to such volatile and often toxic reaction media. In this review, recent advances in the reducing methodologies with an improved degree of sustainability have been described. In particular, a series of examples have been reported to highlight the chance to reduce an organic compound by using a benign solvent deriving from renewable sources, without waiving to the process efficiency and selectivity. Some important key points of green chemistry, such as the easiness of catalyst recovery or the simplicity of product isolation, have been considered in the choice of the described studies.

         <title>Discovery of New Cytotoxic Aplaminone Derivatives from the Sea Hare Aplysia kurodai and Elucidation of Their Accumulation from Local Sea Algae through the Food Chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six new cytotoxic aplaminone derivatives 3&#8211;8 were discovered from the herbivorous marine mollusk Aplysia kurodai. A comprehensive LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis of the extracts of sea algae distributing in the habitats of A.&#8197;kurodai revealed that aplaminones could accumulate in A.&#8197;kurodai from the red algae belonging to the Laurencia complex, and the presence/absence of aplaminones varied depending on the collection sites for the same species.







Abstract
The shell&#8208;less herbivorous marine mollusk (sea hare) Aplysia kurodai is known to contain a variety of bioactive substances. While these compounds have been thought to originate from sea algae or their associated microbes, most of their origin and acquisition pathways are still unclear. Six new cytotoxic aplaminone derivatives, bromodopamine&#8208;terpenoid hybrid molecules, were isolated from A.&#8197;kurodai. Among them, isoaplaminone had a reverse prenyl group at the C15 aliphatic chain, which is a rare structural feature from the viewpoint of terpenoid biosynthesis. Investigation for chemical components in A.&#8197;kurodai and the sea algae collected at several different locations revealed that two major aplaminones were contained in the Laurencia complex species at specific sites. Our chemical and ecological studies provide new insights into the origin of marine alkaloid toxins and their dynamism through the food chain.

         <title>Multidynamic Crystalline Molecular Rotors Comprising an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Binuclear Au(I) Complex Bearing Multiple Rotators</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report novel multi&#8208;rotational solid&#8208;state dynamics utilizing a crystalline molecular rotor bearing multicomponent rotators encapsulated by a concave&#8208;shaped NHC Au(I) complex. The motion of the central pyrazine and neighboring THF molecules are characterized, and it is observed that a larger libration of THF with fast exchange allows pyrazine to undergo 180&#176; of 2&#8208;fold rotation.







Abstract
We report multidynamic molecular rotations in crystals using a concave&#8208;shape N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) binuclear Au(I) complex rotor bearing pyrazine and tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecules as multicomponent rotators. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed that two THF molecules are located near the central pyrazine encapsulated by two bulky NHC ligands. From 2H solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, it was observed that the pyrazine rotated in a 2&#8208;fold site exchange with a 180&#176; rotational angle and a 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 energy barrier, while the THF molecules showed a 23&#176;&#8208;38&#176; libration with a lower energy barrier (14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Interestingly, the pyrazine rotation was accelerated when the THF molecules rotated in fast site exchange with a large angle of libration, suggesting that the rotators exhibit multidynamics in a correlated manner.

         <title>Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8211;Dioxaborinine Hybrid Dyes: Synthesis and Substituent Effect in the Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel family of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8211;dioxaborinine (PP&#8211;DB) hybrid dyes was synthesized by the direct construction of the dioxaborinine (DB) fragment on the pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine (PP) ring, which implies the formation of four new bonds in a one&#8208;pot manner. The dyes&#8217; optical properties were investigated and compared with the starting pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines; a study evidencing large fluorescence quantum yields in products (&#981;f up to 69%) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process from the PP core to a ring of DB (PP &#8594; DB) that is absent in precursors (&#981;f = 0.03&#8211;0.30). TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirmed the fluorescence process involved in the novel dyes, where their ICT limits the non&#8208;radiative process due to the restricted rotation in the D&#8211;A system. The present work provides insight into how phenyl and DB ring incorporation impact the optical properties of this new group of hybrids dyes based on PP&#8211;DB.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Radical Borylation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in the discovery, development, and mechanistic studies of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical borylation processes.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in synthetic chemistry, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. The preparation of them often requires either reactive organometallic reagents or transition metals. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free borylation methodologies using radical chemistry for C&#8722;B bond formation have attracted much attention and developed rapidly, which circumvents the use of preformed organometallic reagents. Various successful approaches from different radical precursors (such as carboxylic acids, amines and alcohols, which are abundant in nature) through either thermochemical, photochemical or electrochemical pathways have been developed. Therefore, in this review, we hope to provide an overview of recent advances in the discovery, development, and mechanistic study of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical borylation processes.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates the acylation reaction of cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane. In this reaction system, one [3]rotaxane has 36 hydroxyl groups on two CD units, and excess of methacryl anhydride was added, as shown on the background. However, approximately only one methacryl unit (highlighted by yellow color) was introduced to one CD ring when the reaction condition was properly designed, probably owing to the steric hindrance. As a result, the product could be used as a [3]rotaxane crosslinker to afford network polymer crosslinked by through&#8208;space bonding. Cover design by Yosuke Akae. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Akae and T. Takata.

         <dc:description>A concise approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (8a) and (&#8722;)&#8208;7a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (8b) using stereoselective domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction as a key step. In presence of TiCl4, the oxaspiropentane&#8208;azide derivatives underwent stereoselective domino cyclization to furnish the corresponding angularly fused azatricyclic cores in very good yields. Moreover, azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A has also been realized, in a stepwise manner, through the intramolecular Schmidt reaction of azido&#8208;spirocyclobutanone intermediate.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and Benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines Using Trialkylamines as Alkyl Synthon</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light photocatalytic approach for the construction of 2&#8208;alkyl substituted quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines using trialkylamines as carbon synthons has been developed. Some of the notable features of this methodology include the synthesis of potent central nervous system depressants (CNS) drug molecules methaqualone (3&#8201;la), mecloqualone (3&#8201;pa) and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.







Abstract
Highly functionalized quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones were synthesized from reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzamides with trialkylamines under photocatalytic conditions by using eosin Y (EY) as a catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in aqueous acetonitrile and has a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies disclosed the electron&#8208;donor nature of the intermediate 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one (3&#8217;) in the photocatalytic cycle to afford the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones (3). This methodology has been extended to synthesize benzo [4,5] imidazole[1,2&#8208;c] quinazolines and 3&#8201;aa on a large scale. Furthermore, the synthesis of potent central nervous system depressant (CNS) drug molecules such as methaqualone (3&#8201;la) and mecloqualone (3&#8201;pa) was also achieved successfully.

         <dc:description>
A new method for direct preparation of diphenyl sulfides using P&#8208;toluenesulfonyl chloride as an effective thiophenyl radical precursor with assistance from Hemin. Various substituted anisoles and benzenesulfonyl chlorides are well tolerated. Gram scale reactions showed a satisfactory performance, demonstrating the potential synthetic application of this method.







Abstract
Diaryl sulfides are a class of important synthetic chemical units. Herein, we report a new method for direct preparation of diphenyl sulfides using P&#8208;toluenesulfonyl chloride as an effective thiophenyl radical precursor with assistance from Hemin. Various substituted anisoles and benzenesulfonyl chlorides are well tolerated, resulting in moderate to good yields of diaryl sulfides. The potential of the proposed method is validated by good yields obtained in gram scale reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition via electrochemically generated cuprous species leading to 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in good yield and regioselectivity was accomplished. Selected triazoles were applied for the spectrophotometric detection of transition metal analytes.







Abstract
Herein, we report the electro&#8208;click (e&#8208;CLICK) reaction via electrochemically generated copper(I) catalytic species. The reaction worked under constant potential electrolysis (&#8722;0.25&#8197;V) with copper(II) nitrate and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine serving as pre&#8208;catalyst and ligand respectively. The reaction accommodates electronically different organic azides and terminal alkynes to afford 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in good synthetic yields with excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity. Compared to traditional click chemistry, the developed e&#8208;CLICK methodology avoids the use of external reducing agents such as sodium ascorbate. Absorptive properties of selected triazole products were assessed by UV&#8208;visible electronic spectra. Triazole (3&#8201;e) was further applied for the spectrophotometric detection of Co2+ and Cu2+ species.

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of rac&#8208;Betuphenone F</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Betuphenone F, a natural product isolated from the bark of Betula alnoides Ham. ex D. Don, has the potential to be a new&#8208;generation anti&#8208;cancer agents based on anti&#8208;austerity. We succeeded in constructing the 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, a structural feature of betuphenone F, and achieved the first total synthesis of rac&#8208;bethuphenone F from phloroglucinol in three steps.







Abstract
Betuphenone F (6) is a natural product isolated from the bark of Betula alnoides Ham. ex D. Don (Betulaceae) and structurally determined by S. Awale et&#8197;al. in 2021. Betuphenone F (6) has the potential to be a new&#8208;generation anti&#8208;cancer agents based on anti&#8208;austerity, as it showed preferential cytotoxicity against PANC&#8208;1 human pancreatic cancer cells under nutrient&#8208;deprived conditions (PC50 value of 4.9&#8197;&#956;M). We succeeded in constructing the 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, which is a structural feature of betuphenone F (6), by exposing intermediate 9 to acid, and achieved the first total synthesis of rac&#8208;bethuphenone F (6) from phloroglucinol (7) in only three steps.

New anomeric spiro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam and spiro&#8208;cyclobutanone derivatives were synthesized by [2+2] cycloadditions of methylene exo&#8208;glycals with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate and dichloroketene. The reactions were studied in detail, investigating the effect of carbohydrate moiety, protecting groups as well as reaction temperature on the yields. The transformation of spiro&#8208;cyclobutanone into spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone was demonstrated.

         <dc:description>Oxovanadium(V)&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling reaction of allyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers was demonstrated to afford &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one&#8208;step. The catalytic deoxygenative coupling reaction of allyl alcohols proceeded smoothly with both aromatic and aliphatic trimethylsilyl enol ethers. This catalytic deoxygenative coupling system could be applied to the deoxygenative coupling reaction of benzyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers, providing the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale catalytic synthesis of the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound was successfully performed to validate the scalability of this catalytic deoxygenative coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified by a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.</dc:description>

Such a combination of Diels-Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one-pot process without by-product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio-based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi-step one-pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses and Preliminary Biological Evaluations of the Dibromopyrrole&#8208;Containing Marine Natural Products Agesasine A, Agesasine B, Longamide E and Various Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of the title marine natural products have been achieved and so confirming the structures originally assigned to them. Upon subjecting agesasine A and its corresponding ethyl ester to Mitsunobu conditions a 1,5&#8208;cyclodehydration reaction takes place to give 2&#8208;oxazolines. In contrast, on subjecting agesasine B to the same Mitsunobu conditions then a simple dehydration reaction occurs to give the corresponding acrylate. A total synthesis of longamide E was achieved by engaging a 1,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrole in a lactam&#8208;forming reaction and this was followed by a two&#8208;fold and fully regio&#8208;controlled bromination reaction. A distinctly different and possibly biomimetic route was used to synthesize, via the open&#8208;chain natural product nakamurine B, longamide B and its methyl ester. Preliminary biological evaluations of the title alkaloids and various analogues against a small human cancer cell line panel reveals cytotoxic properties that vary significantly with structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Studies of Thermoresponsive Copper (I) Complex towards Click Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ensure the easy removal of Copper catalyst after click reaction, a thermoresponsive polymer (PNIPAM) is incorporated. As a result, through the volume phase transition behavior of PNIPAM, the catalyst can easily be removed from the system by simply heating.







Abstract
Click reaction or copper&#8208;assisted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can conveniently synthesize desired organic molecules or functionalize biological macromolecules. In many cases, trace amounts of residual copper from the reaction mixture are not trivial to remove when the exhaustive purification step is avoided to fulfill the essential criteria of a click reaction. It is often detrimental, particularly for biochemical applications or when it involves biological macromolecules. Herein, we have reported the synthesis of a new type of copper (I) complex as a smart catalyst for click reaction, which can be separated from the reaction mixture very easily by the slight elevation of temperature, thanks to its thermoresponsive behavior. The click reactions using a thermoresponsive catalyst were first studied in an aqueous medium using various organic molecules containing alkyne and azide functional groups. Later, the strategy was extended to biological macromolecules like collagen.

         <title>O&#8208;Acylative Vinylation of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxane Towards Rotaxane Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Random acylation of cyclodextrin (CD) was revealed to highly depend on the steric hindrance of the reagent. Based on this phenomenon, the facile synthesis of a [3]rotaxane crosslinker was implemented via random methacrylation without any demanding synthetic process. The mono&#8208;modification of CD is known to be useful but demanding work; however, we propose a novel process for overcoming this trade&#8208;off, promoting both convenience and usefulness.







Abstract
The acylation of a cyclodextrin&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was implemented with anhydride reagents following a facile procedure. Methacrylic anhydride facilitated the introduction of a vinyl&#8208;group into the rotaxane structure toward achieving a crosslinker. Interestingly, only a few methacrylic units were attached to the cyclodextrin at reaction temperatures of up to 60&#8201;&#176;C even with an excess amount of the reagent, probably due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the number of vinyl groups on the [3]rotaxane framework was easily controlled to be approximately two units via a simple random acylation, which worked effectively as a facile synthesis route for the rotaxane crosslinker. The acylation behavior was investigated in detail by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analyses. Such a proposed approach will help overcome the trade&#8208;off between convenience and utility associated with the mono&#8208;modification of cyclodextrins.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Light&#8208;Mediated, Site&#8208;Specific, Radical C6&#8722;H Alkylation of Purines with Alcohols Intervened by Oxalates without Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical protocol for highly regioselective C6&#8722;H alkylation of purines with alcohols intervened by oxalates under blue LED irradiation is reported. This transformation does not need transition metal catalysts, is not sensitive to moisture and does not require N2 protection. Besides, this method displays broad functional groups compatibility and is easily scale up.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of a radical deoxy&#8208;functionalization strategy for the direct C&#8722;H alkylation of purines and purine nucleosides with alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;) intervened by oxalates under 12&#8197;W blue LED irradiation. The reaction shows high regioselectivity at C6&#8722;H position of purine and is suitable for N9&#8208;, N7&#8208;substitued purines. The process accommodates purines and alcohols to deliver a wide range of products (31 examples) in 41&#8211;91&#8201;% yields, which avoids transition metal catalysts and organometallic reagents, and is not sensitive to moisture and air. Besides, the mild protocol displays broad functional groups tolerance and is easily up scalable to gram scale and can be used for late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H alkylation of purine to synthesize pharmaceutical 6&#8208;cyclopentyl nebularine with anti&#8208;CEM activity or natural d&#8208;menthol modification.

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;4 picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.







Abstract
The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration.

     alt="Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre-clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Last Fortress of Tin's Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods used for the protodenitration of nitroalkanes were reviewed. Despite several decades of intense research, the most frequently used option remains the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing toxic tributyltin hydride. Thus, the protodenitration of nitroalkanes remains the last fortress of the tyranny of tin.







Abstract
Protodenitration, a direct reduction of nitroalkanes to corresponding alkanes, already spans two centuries and is enabled by various reagents. This mini&#8208;review provides a historical development of the fundamental transformation and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride and environmentally unpopular solvents sharply contrasting with modern ecological trends, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin's tyranny.&#8221;

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ortho&#8208;Quinols are chiral 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives of interest to organic chemists because of their natural occurrence, their role as intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse natural products, and the versatility of their chemical reactivity. Readily accessible from dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenols or other arenols, ortho&#8208;quinols constitute useful molecular entities from which structural complexity can be rapidly built, as highlighted herein through many examples of targeted syntheses of natural products, such as trichodimerol.







Abstract
6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70&#8197;years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.

         <title>Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last few years, Katritzky salts emerged as a potential tool for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides. In this review, we summarized the applications of deaminative functionalization in the peptide chemistry field, including cross&#8208;coupling, photocatalysis, &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and macrocyclization. Moreover, findings confirmed the on&#8208;resin feasibility of using Katritzky salts in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptide drug discovery often benefits from the large structural diversity permitted by unnatural amino acids (UAAs). Indeed, numerous approved peptide drugs include UAAs in their sequences. Therefore, innovative chemical approaches either to synthesize UAAs or to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides are emerging themes in peptide drug discovery. Thanks to the recent advances in deaminative strategies using alkylpyridiniums salts, often referred to as Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed. In recent years the use of Katritzky salts have become popular in peptide chemistry due to their ease of preparation from a primary amine, which is a predominant functional group in amino acids. This review highlights the progress that has been made by using Katritzky salts in the synthesis of UAAs, late&#8208;stage peptide functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;A method for the synthesis of 2-aryl-N-heterocyclic dimers via a cross-dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo-CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine-borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
