         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner&#8217;s thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible via rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization via multipoint mutual interactions.</dc:description>

The Cover Feature shows the synthesis of NH&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams through three&#8208;component Castagnoli&#8211;Cushman reaction of 3&#8208;arylglutaconic anhydrides with carbonyl compound and ammonium acetate. The way chemical building blocks are united to form the desired heterocyclic product is compared to the famous tile&#8208;matching Tetris game. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Krasavin et&#8197;al.

         <title>P(III)&#8208;Assisted Electrochemical Access to Ureas via in&#8197;situ Generation of Isocyanates from Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1768-1772, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
P(III)&#8208;assisted electrochemical generation of isocyanates from hydroxamic acids was successfully applied in the synthesis of ureas. Hydroxamic acids were directly used without pre&#8208;activation, and the reaction was found not sensitive to water or air. The process started with the anodic oxidation of hydroxamic acids, followed by reacting with trivalent phosphine to form corresponding alkoxyphosphoniums, and subsequent rearrangement to give isocyanates.







Abstract
An external oxidant&#8208;free protocol for the generation of isocyanates from hydroxamic acids assisted by trivalent phosphine under mild electrochemical conditions was reported. The process started with the anodic oxidation of hydroxamic acids, followed by reacting with phosphine to form corresponding alkoxyphosphoniums and subsequent rearrangement with the release of tri&#8208;substituted phosphine oxide as the driving force to give isocyanates, which were trapped by N&#8208;based nucleophiles to produce various ureas. This method provides a broadly applicable procedure to access isocyanate intermediates under mild electrochemical conditions.

         <title>Noncovalent interactions between stacked arenes in 1,8&#8208;bis&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes.[1]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes, bearing different substituents in the 1&#8208;naphthyl moieties have been prepared to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the stacked arenes. The best geometries were determined by means of DFT calculations, and experimentally checked by NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). High temperature NMR spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the balance between dispersive and electrostatic contributions (ratio between two diastereomeric  syn/anti  isomers of compounds  1  &#8208;  6  ), while ECD analysis of the  syn  isomers of compounds  3  &#8208;  5  allowed for a deeper insight on the electrostatic contributions that drive the geometry between the interacting rings. The two rings preferentially adopt a parallel displaced geometry, whose interaction energy is strongly influenced by the electrostatic features of the two naphthyl rings, and that dispersive forces play a very minor role.</dc:description>

         <title>A kinetic photometric assay for the quantification of aldoses&#8217; open&#8208;chain content</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldoses exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form, which is in equilibrium with the open&#8208;chain aldehyde form. The small aldehyde content hampers reactivity when chemistry addresses the carbonyl moiety. This low concentration of the available aldehyde is generally difficult to ascertain. Herein, we demonstrate a new kinetic determination of the (minute) open&#8208;chain content (OCC) of aldoses. This kinetic approach exploits the aldehyde&#8208;selectivity of 2&#8208;aminobenzamidoxime (ABAO), which furnishes a strongly UV&#8208;active adduct. Simple formation curves can be measured in a photometer or plate reader for high&#8208;throughput screening. Under pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics, these curves correlate with a prediction model yielding the relative OCC. The OCCs of all parent aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) were determined referencing against the two tetroses with exceptionally high OCCs and were in very good agreement with literature data. Additionally, the assay was extended towards higher&#8208;carbon sugars with unknown OCC and also applied to rationalise a lack of reactivity observed in a recent synthetic investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydroarylative Coupling of Indolines with Internal Alkynes via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a regioselective hydroarylative coupling of indolines with internal alkynes via the activation of C&#8211;H bond using inexpensive Ru(II)&#8208;catalyst. This redox&#8208;neutral, atom&#8208;economical, and scalable C&#8211;H functionalization has been accomplished using easily removable weakly coordinating directing group. Diverse unsymmetrically substituted alkynes appended with pharmacologically important heterocycles were coupled with various indolines and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines to furnish the corresponding trisubstituted alkenes with very high regioselectivity. The application of the method has been demonstrated with a number of alkyne&#8208;containing drug molecules, natural product, carbohydrates, amino acids, steroids and other heterocycles. Preliminary mechanistic interrogation revealed that the C&#8211;H activation proceeds through base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic&#8208;type substitution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized 2&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehyde&#8208;PEG Modules as Portable Tags for the Engagement of Protein Lysine &#1013;&#8208;Amino Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1763-1767, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (2HB) tag can enhance the affinity of small molecule ligands for their protein target, by engaging &#1013;&#8208;amino groups of lysine residues in stable imines. We propose herein a convenient synthetic route to 2HB&#8208;PEG (polyethylene glycol) modules, bearing a suitable functional group (alkyne, azide, carboxylic acid and amine) as reactive handle for the tag conjugation to virtually any type of small molecule ligand.







Abstract
The formation of reversible&#8208;covalent interactions between a small&#8208;molecule ligand and its protein target is emerging as a general strategy to design binders with increased affinity. In this context, 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (2HB) has been recently proposed as suitable electrophilic tag to engage primary amines, such as the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of lysine residues, in remarkably stable imines. Lys residues are often expressed in high amounts on protein surfaces and in the proximity of ligand binding sites, and a fine&#8208;tuning of the chemical connection between the ligand and 2HB is fundamental for the affinity gain. Herein we report the synthesis of four 2HB tags functionalized with a short polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer and a suitable reactive &#8216;handle&#8217; (alkyne, azide, carboxylic acid and amine, respectively) for their conjugation to virtually any type of small molecule ligand.

         <title>Magnesium Monoperphthalate (MMPP): a Convenient Oxidant for the Direct Rubottom Oxidation of Malonates, &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters, and Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1758-1762, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available and inexpensive magnesium monoperphthalate (MMPP) was found to be an effective oxidant for the first direct Rubottom hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;substituted malonates, &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, and &#946;&#8208;ketoamides, when working in ethanol at room temperature and using NaHCO3 as basic additive. The feasibility of gram scale oxidation was also demonstrated.







Abstract
A mild and convenient protocol for the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;substituted malonates, &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, and &#946;&#8208;ketoamides is disclosed. Cheap and stable magnesium monoperphthalate (MMPP) was effective for a first direct &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation protocol of the Rubottom oxidation, providing tartronic esters, cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and amides in good to high yields, when working at room temperature and in ethanol as the solvent. The protocol has been successfully scaled up to gram quantity.

         <title>A diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large libraries of artificial macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large artificial macrocycle libraries with a ring size of 13&#8211;18 atoms relying on the "build&#8208;couple&#8208;pair" strategy is disclosed. The "couple" phase included three one&#8208;pot steps including consequent amide coupling of N &#8208;Boc&#8208;mono&#173;protected vicinal diamines with two alkenyl carboxylic acids, followed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key "pair" step. The scope and limitations of the method were established for all three reagents. In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8211;C&#8211;C&#8211;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8901;10 5 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving a rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0 g).</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketone and of Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (  1  ) and of its alcoholic derivatives (  cis  &#8208;  2  and  trans&#8208;  3  ). Specifically, two enzymes from our in house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone  1  or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic  cis  &#8208;alcohol (  2  ) was very efficiently obtained (E &#8773; 2.000) by lipase&#8208;PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with e.e. &#8805; 95%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials: unravelling the emissive behaviour of chloro&#8208;substituted derivatives of cyclic triimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic luminophores that exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are receiving an ever growing attention. The design of efficient RTP materials and the understanding of their emissive behaviour, however, remain a challenging task. Herein, to gain further insights into metal&#8208;free RTP, we report the synthesis, characterization and photophysical study of chloro&#8208;derivatives of [1,2&#8208;  a  :1',2'&#8208;  c  :1'',2''&#8208;  e  ][1,3,5]triazine or cyclic triimidazole (  TT  ). Mono&#8208; (  1Cl  ), di&#8208; (  2Cl  ) and tri&#8208;chloro&#8208;  TT  (  3Cl  ) derivatives are prepared by mild chlorination with  N  &#8211;chlorosuccinimide (NCS). The three &#160;compounds are characterized by aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) comprising &#160;dual fluorescence and multiple phosphorescences, whose origin is disclosed by crystal structure analysis together with accurate DFT/TDDFT calculations. Comparison with previously reported bromine and iodine  TT  derivatives reveals the new chlorinated compounds as the best performing halogenated AIE members of the family.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and additive&#8208;free hydrogenation of nitroarenes mediated by a DMSO&#8208;tagged molecular cobalt corrole catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first cobalt corrole that effectively mediates the homogeneous hydrogenation of structurally diverse nitroarenes to afford the corresponding amines. The given catalyst is easily assembled prior to use from 4&#8208; tert &#8208;butylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole followed by metalation of the resulting corrole macrocycle with cobalt(II) acetate. The thus&#8208;prepared complex is self&#8208;contained in that the hydrogenation protocol is free from the requirement for adding any auxiliary reagent to elicit the catalytic activity of the applied metal complex. Moreover, a containment system is not required for the assembly of the hydrogenation reaction set&#8208;up as both the autoclave and the reaction vessels are readily charged under a regular laboratory atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Opines via Asymmetric Pd&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of Amino Acid Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereo&#8208;divergent synthesis of natural and unnatural opines in stereochemically pure form is based on the direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed  N  &#8208;allylation of a&#8208;amino acid esters (up to 97% e.e. or 99:1 d.r.) using methyl (E)&#8208;2&#8208;penten&#8208;4&#8208;yl carbonate in the presence of only 1 mol% of a catalyst prepared in&#8208;situ from the C  2  &#8208;symmetric diphos&#173;phine  i  Pr&#8208;MediPhos and [Pd(allyl)Cl]  2  . Selected target compounds (incl. a derivative of the drug enalapril) were efficiently obtained from the  N  &#8208;allylated intermediates by oxidative cleavage (ozonolysis) of the allylic C=C bond under temporary  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Deoxygenation of 2&#176; Benzylic Alcohols through a Sequence of Formylation and B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequence of formylation and B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the resulting formate with Et3SiH enables the chemoselective deoxygenation of secondary benzylic alcohols. Primary benzylic and tertiary non&#8208;benzylic alcohols are not reduced by this protocol. The formyl group fulfills a double role as activator and self&#8208;sacrificing protecting group. The deoxygenation of these formates is fast and can be carried out in the presence of other potentially reducible groups. Neighboring&#8208;group participation was found in the deoxygenation of certain diol motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;step Synthesis of 4H&#8208;Cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene from Pyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4  H  &#8208;Cyclopenta[  def  ]phenanthrene (CPP) is a valuable building block in the production of optically active polymers, which find use in a wide range of organic electronic applications. Of particular importance is their use in the development of blue&#8208;colored, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which remains a challenge in the field. Unfortunately, commercial sources and synthetic procedures known in the literature are unable to provide enough CPP for large scale implementation. Here we report on the development of a novel, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of CPP in three steps, starting from pyrene. The key steps in our methodology are the ring contraction of pyrene&#8208;4,5&#8208;dione to oxoCPP in a single step, as well as the direct reduction of oxoCPP to CPP. Apart from the small number of synthetic steps, our methodology benefits from the use of relatively non&#8208;hazardous reagents, together with optimized purification procedures, making CPP accessible in useful quantities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new and more practical method for the preparation of solution&#8208;stable perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids was successfully developed. Starting from perfluoroalkyl iodides, perfluoroalkyl sulfoxides were synthesized by their substitution reaction with alkyl mercaptans and the following oxidation of resulting perfluoroalkyl sulfides with  m  &#8208;CPBA. Subsequent  &#946;  &#8208;H elimination of perfluoroalkyl sulfoxides under heating conditions gave the corresponding perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Diaryl 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>The Aza Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction on Brominated Conjugated Dienes.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of electron&#8208;deficient dienes as substrates in the aza Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (ADA) has scarcely been studied. However, the ADA process offers a huge range of applications in organic synthesis. In this communication, the reaction between different brominated conjugated dienes and 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (PTAD), one of the most vigorous dienophiles, is reported. We have synthesized tricyclic compounds from acyclic substrates in only two steps, taking into account variables such as ring size and steric hindrance and substantially improved the results obtained with other dienophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Butterfly Mesogens Based on Carbazole, Fluorene or Fluorenone: Mesomorphous, Gelling, Photophysical, and Photoconductive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic synthetic method based on the Suzuki&#8208;Scholl reactions was successfully exploited to yield new poly(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons containing carbazole, fluorene or fluorenone moieties. These butterfly&#8208;like mesogens exhibit columnar mesophases, form fibrous gels in various solvents, emit blue to orange light in films and solutions and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the &#8764;0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range.







Abstract
We report a straightforward and generic synthesis of several new series of annulated &#960;&#8208;extended poly&#8208;(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), with carbazole, fluorene and fluorenone central building blocks by the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Scholl tandem reactions. The corresponding series of ditriphenylene discogens with a carbazole or a fluorenone central core, respectively, possess hexagonal columnar mesophases with broad mesophase ranges and high clearing points, as well as demonstrate a strong aggregation tendency in organic solvents as supergelators. The laterally&#8208;substituted ditriphenylene mesogens based on dimethyl&#8208;fluorene core exhibit a rich polymorphism with rectangular and hexagonal columnar mesophases from low temperatures onward, whereas their dioctyl&#8208;fluorene homologues melt directly into the isotropic liquid without showing mesophases. These latter family of compounds are luminescent with very high fluorescent quantum yields, of around 70&#8201;% in solution, and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, as measured by photocurrent transient time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (TOF) technique. This straightforward molecular design and simple synthetic strategy proved to be both potent and resilient, and could be generally applied to the fabrication of a great variety of other heteroarene molecular systems as organic semiconductors and electroluminescent materials for potentially low&#8208;cost applications.

In search for a new synthetic pathway for azoxybenzenes with different substitution patterns, an approach using a microfluidic reactor with gel&#8208;bound proline organocatalysts under continuous flow inside a microfluidic device is presented.







Abstract
In the search for a new synthetic pathway for azoxybenzenes with different substitution patterns, an approach using a microfluidic reactor with gel&#8208;bound proline organocatalysts under continuous flow is presented. Herein the formation of differently substituted azoxybezenes by reductive dimerization of nitrosobenzenes within minutes at mild conditions in good to almost quantitative yields is described. The conversion within the microfluidic reactor is analyzed and used for optimizing and validating different parameters. The effects of the different functionalities on conversion, yield, and reaction times are analyzed in detail by NMR. The applicability of this reductive dimerization is demonstrated for a wide range of differently substituted nitrosobenzenes. The effects of these different functionalities on the structure of the obtained azoxyarenes are analyzed in detail by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on these results, the turnover number and the turnover frequency were determined.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aminohalogenation of Alkynyl Carbamates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1750-1757, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aminohalogenation reaction of O&#8208;alkynyl carbamates under copper catalysis has been developed. The intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation occurs selectively affording haloalkylidene substituted heterocycles. In the case of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;substituted propargyl carbamate, the alkoxyhalogenation pathway was operative. The mechanism for the two alternative reaction pathways was investigated by modeling the corresponding transition states at the DFT level.







Abstract
A useful aminohalogenation reaction for the cyclization of O&#8208;alkynyl carbamates under copper catalysis has been developed. N&#8208;Halosuccinimides have been used as a halogen source. The intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation occurs selectively affording haloalkylidene substituted heterocycles. Just in the case of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;substituted propargyl carbamate, the alkoxyhalogenation pathway was operative. The mechanism for the two alternative reaction pathways was investigated by modeling the corresponding transition states at the DFT level.

The fine tuning FVP temperature allowed the achievement of different homolytic cleavages of cis&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;imine and thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;imine derivatives. The Arrhenius parameters together with calculations were of vital importance to suggest a pattern fragmentation for all of them in the gas phase.







Abstract
Cis&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and cis&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines were prepared and subjected to Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP). NH&#8722; and NCH3&#8722; oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio&#8208; analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH2Ph&#8722; compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N&#8722; substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions (initiated by X3&#8722;C4, C8a&#8722;N1, or C2&#8722;X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N&#8208;substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones. Experimental results agree with calculations at the DFT level (B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G(d,p)) and M06&#8208;2X (6&#8208;311+G(d,p)) from Gaussian09 software.

         <title>Trimodular Solution&#8208;Phase Protocol for Rapid Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Hydrogen Bond Surrogate&#8208;Constrained &#945;&#8208;Helicomimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1714-1719, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;yielding, rapid trimodular solution&#8208;phase method has been demonstrated to synthesize the hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained single &#945;&#8208;helical turn and C&#8208;terminal extended helices. The HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimic is divided into three modules and each of them was synthesized in 100&#8197;mmol scale followed by connecting them to adopt the &#945;&#8208;helicomimic.







Abstract
Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in the production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained &#945;&#8208;helical peptides (&#945;&#8208;helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein&#8208;biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics have shown the highest helicities in both single turn and extended, &#945;&#8208;helices (ST&#945;H, E&#945;H). Here we present a solution&#8208;phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost synthesis of libraries of ST&#945;H and E&#945;H in high yields. The key to efficiency is our trimodular (M1, M2, M3) synthetic protocol where M1 is a library of HBS&#8208;linked peptidomimetic synthons of both ST&#945;H and E&#945;H; M2 and M3 are desired oligopeptide libraries. Advantages of the trimodular method over conventional unimodular methods are demonstrated through the synthesis of large&#8208;scale libraries of M1, ST&#945;H, and E&#945;H.

         <title>A Concise Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Methoxyl Citreochlorols and Their Structural Revisions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1637-1642, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, highly stereoselective and protecting group free total synthesis of methoxyl citreochlorols was demonstrated. All four stereoisomers were synthesized to establish the absolute stereochemistry of the reported structures and the structures were revised accordingly. An insitu generated silyl iodide promoted ring&#8208;opening iodo esterification of lactones, a direct dichloromethylation of ester group and syn&#8208; &amp; anti&#8208;selective reduction of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone were employed as key steps. The overall yields after eight&#8208;step synthesis are obtained as 24&#8201;% and 21&#8201;% from commercially available (+) and (&#8722;)&#8208;malic acids.







Abstract
A concise, stereoselective and protecting group free approaches for the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(2S,4R)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;(2R,4S)&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyl citreochlorols and their stereoisomers are demonstrated. All four stereoisomers were synthesized to establish the absolute stereochemistry of the reported structures and the structures were revised accordingly. The approach involves chelation controlled regioselective reduction of a diester, silyl iodide promoted ring&#8208;opening iodo esterification of lactones, highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective ring&#8208;opening of an epoxy ester, dichloromethylation of a carboxyl group, and syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective reduction of the resulted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone as key steps.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Chromene Cores through Gold (I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation Reaction (IMHA)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1676-1687, March 19, 2021. </description>

A gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed approach for the construction of polycyclic chromene cores was developed. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild condition. In the presence of unsymmetrically substituted propargylic ethers a good selectivity has been achieved.







Abstract
A regioselective gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed approach for the construction of polycyclic chromene cores has been developed. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild condition with a broad range of substrates providing a simple and efficient tool for the synthesis of pyranochromene derivatives. Moreover, the regiochemical control of the annulation of unsymmetrically substituted propargylic ethers has been investigated focusing on electronic/steric effects of the ligands of gold complexes as well as on the electronic effects of the groups on the aromatic rings.

         <title>A Thorough Study on the Photoisomerization of Ferulic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1737-1749, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of photoisomerzation of ferulic acid derived esters, amides, and ketones was carried out. Only in the case of aliphatic tertiary amides, a nearly complete E&#8594;Z conversion was achieved.







Abstract
A thorough study on the (E) to (Z) photoisomerization of ferulic acid derivatives (esters, amides of all types, and ketones) was carried out. At the photostationary state, only aliphatic or benzylic tertiary amides reach a nearly complete conversion of (E) isomers into the (Z) ones, whereas for esters, primary and secondary amides or aromatic tertiary amides mixtures of (Z)/(E) ranging from 7&#8201;:&#8201;93 to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 are observed. Ketones show rather limited photoisomerization. However, (Z) ketones may be obtained by the reaction of organometal compounds with an isomerized (Z) Weinreb amide.

         <title>Stereoselective Organocatalytic Construction of Spiro Oxindole Pyrrolidines Using Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1693-1703, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;oxindole pyrrolidines are formed by formal [3+2] cycloaddition between oxindole imines and unsaturated keto esters and keto amide. Keto amides also afford alternative products via enolate protonation and addition of nitrogen on the carbonyl group. Quinine&#8208;based squaramide organocatalyst was able to provide keto ester pyrrolidines in enantiomeric purity of up to e.r. 86&#8201;:&#8201;14.







Abstract
We have investigated the stereoselective formation of spiro oxindole pyrrolidines via formal [3+2] cycloaddition of oxindole imines with ketoesters and ketoamides. Bifunctional squaramide organocatalyst was able to induce enantioselectivity of up to 60&#8201;% ee, increased to 72&#8201;% ee after re&#8208;crystallization, in the formation of spiro pyrrolidines with ketoesters. Interestingly, ketoamides provided alternative spiro oxindole pyrrole products in addition to the main product, which was formed via a different reaction pathway. Structures of spiro oxindole pyrrolidine as well as pyrrole products were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Two new squaramide based catalysts were synthesized and tested. DFT calculation helped elucidate the reaction course.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. A decade update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1653-1675, March 19, 2021. </description>

The reactivity of 2&#8208;oxindoles bearing a C=X double bond (X=C&lt;, N&#8722;, O) in the 3&#8208;position towards a variety of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species has been reviewed in a systematic way according to the type of the 1,3&#8208;dipole, the 2&#8208;oxindole dipolarophile, and the racemic or asymmetric nature of the cycloaddition. Because of the great variety of the resulting spiro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeletons, the developments occurred in the 2010&#8211;2020 decade were taken into account.







Abstract
The great variety of spirooxindole three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds encompasses relevant bioactive natural alkaloids as well as useful therapeutic agents. In view of the challenging features of the spirooxindole skeletons and their desirable properties, several synthetic routes have been devoted to their preparation. Because of the variety of both 1,3&#8208;dipolar species and 2&#8208;oxindoles bearing a C=X double bond (X=C&lt;, N&#8722;, O) in the 3&#8208;position, a prominent role relies upon a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition as the key step of the whole synthetic sequence. The present paper aims to discuss the developments in the field of spirooxindole synthesis via a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition occurred in the 2011&#8211;2020 decade. The literature data on this subject are reviewed in a systematic way according to the type of the 1,3&#8208;dipole and the oxindole dipolarophile.

         <title>Synthesis of Imidazoles from Fatty 1,2&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1647-1652, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotected fatty imidazoles have been prepared from fatty 1,2&#8208;diketones using ammonium acetate and a range of aldehydes (20 examples) through Debus&#8211;Radziszewski reaction. The corresponding N&#8208;benzyl analogue can be prepared from fatty &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone using 2 equivalents of benzaldehyde.







Abstract
Unsaturated vegetable oils and their corresponding fatty acid derivatives constitute interesting renewable platforms for the preparation of heterocycles, notably through the formation of oxygenated intermediates. In this work, fatty imidazoles were prepared from the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diketones through Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction. The reaction was optimized under microwave irradiation using a 1,2&#8208;diketone derived from methyl oleate and ammonium acetate as a nitrogen source. Using benzaldehyde as a model substrate, the reaction occurs at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;min and the desired imidazole was formed in 96&#8201;% GC yield. A range of aldehydes was tested under the optimized conditions and the corresponding imidazoles were obtained in 33&#8211;99&#8201;% isolated yields (20 examples).

Three&#8208;component Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman reaction of 3&#8208;arylglutaconic anhydrides with carbonyl compound and ammonium acetate delivers medicinally important NH&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams. The scope of the protocol has been thoroughly explored paying particular attention to the carbonyl component using wide array of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes as well as rarely involved cyclic and acyclic ketones.







Abstract
A practical straightforward synthesis of medicinally important NH&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams through the three&#8208;component Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman reaction of 3&#8208;arylglutaconic anhydrides with carbonyl compound and ammonium acetate has been developed. The scope of the protocol has been thoroughly explored paying particular attention to the carbonyl component using wide array of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes as well as rarely involved cyclic and acyclic ketones. Synthetic potential of prepared compounds was demonstrated by a series of post&#8208;modifications, including unexpected isomerization.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Dibenzazepines and Dibenzazocines by 7&#8208;Exo&#8208; and 8&#8208;Endo&#8208;Dig&#8208;Selective Cycloisomerization</title>

The cationic Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction achieved 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization of 2&#8208;propargylamino&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbiphenyls with terminal alkyne along with the construction of a dibezazepine skeleton. In addition, the reaction of internal alkynes gave 8&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective products. This strategy could be used for the ynamide substrate and the intramolecular reaction provided 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selctive cycloadducts by use of a Ag salt.







Abstract
The 7&#8208;exo&#8208; and 8&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerizations of 2&#8208;propargylamino biphenyl derivatives were developed. The reaction of terminal alkynes gave dibenzo[b,d]azepines by 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cycloisomerization. In contrast, when internal alkynes were subjected to the reaction, 8&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cycloisomerization proceeded to provide dibenzo[b,d]azocines. The nucleophilicity at the reaction site and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of a tosyl group were important for the present selective transformation. This protocol could be used for ynamide substrates and a silver&#8208;catalyzed reaction gave 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig products selectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Aminoallenes via Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of N&#8208;Fluorinated Sulfonimides with Simple Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1720-1725, March 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economic route toward aminoallenes from simple alkynes and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) was established via selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. This unprecedented method significantly streamlines the assembly of heterosubstituted 1,3&#8208;propadiene motifs and is characterized by a broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of aminoallenes, accomplished by a selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an N&#8208;fluorinated sulfonimide with simple, non&#8208;activated alkynes, is reported. Until now, aminoallenes were difficult to be accessed by customary means, inasmuch as pre&#8208;activated and, in part, intricate starting materials were necessary for their synthesis. In sharp contrast, the current study shows that ordinary internal alkynes can serve as simple and readily available precursors for the construction of the aminoallene motif. The operating reaction conditions tolerate numerous functional groups such as esters, nitriles, (silyl)ethers, acetals, and halogen substituents, furnishing the target compounds in up to 86&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Photoredox Allylation Reactions Mediated by Bismuth in Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 11, Page 1624-1627, March 19, 2021. </description>

Green Photoredox! Negligibly toxic bismuth salts can be employed in a photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by an organic dye. To further add interest to this new methodology, the photoredox Barbier allylation is carried out in EtOH/water and shows low sensitivity to oxygen and radical scavengers.







Abstract
Organometallic allylic reagents are widely used in the construction of C&#8722;C bonds by Barbier&#8208;type reactions. In this communication, we have described a photoredox Barbier allylation of aldehydes mediated by bismuth, in absence of other metals as co&#8208;reductants. Mild reaction conditions, tolerance of oxygen, and use of aqueous solvent make this photoredox methodology attractive for green and sustainable synthesis of homoallylic alcohols.

An efficient cyanation of &#948;&#8208;substituted para&#8208;quinone methides has been described. Under mild conditions, diarylmethanes bearing CF3&#8208; and CN&#8208;substituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and diarylmalononitriles were obtained in excellent yields. The process displays a broad substrate scope and the products can be successfully transformed to a series of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centres that may serve in the synthesis of valuable pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
An effective construction of diarylmethanes containing CF3&#8208; and CN&#8208;substituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via cyanation of &#948;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#948;&#8208;aryl disubstituted para&#8208;quinone methides has been described. The reaction proceeds smoothly under simple and mild conditions and exhibits a broad scope of &#948;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#948;&#8208;aryl disubstituted para&#8208;quinone methides in high efficiency. &#948;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#948;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;disubstituted para&#8208;quinone methides also proved to be suitable substrates. The rich chemistry of the cyano moiety allows for rapid access to other valuable CF3&#8208;substituted di&#8208; and triarylmethanes containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. The generality of the method was further demonstrated by cyanation of &#948;&#8208;CN&#8208;substituted para&#8208;quinone methides furnishing diarylmalononitriles in good yields.

The generality of the method was further demonstrated by cyanation of &#948;&#8208;CN&#8208;substituted &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;quinone methides furnishing diarylmalononitriles in good yields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>New Chiral BINOL&#8208;Based Phosphates for Enantioselective [Au(I)]&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols with Allenamides</title>

         <dc:description>
New chiral phosphate counterions are proposed in the enantioselective gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols with allenamides. Densely functionalized naphthalenones (ee up to 95&#8201;%) were obtained in the presence of chiral BINOL&#8208;scaffolds featuring EDG&#8208;containing 9,10&#8208;diarylanthracene (L, see Scheme).







Abstract
New chiral BINOL&#8208;based phosphate counterions have been synthesized, fully characterized, and employed in the enantioselective gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols with allenamides. A range of densely functionalized C1&#8208;allylated naphthalenones were realized under mild conditions and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity (ee up to 95&#8201;%).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C(sp2&#8211;H)&#8208;trifluoromethylation of hydrazones would give access to the a&#8208;trifluoromethylated hydrazones that can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically interesting fluorinated compounds. Here, we demonstrate the Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2&#8211;H)&#8208; trifluoromethylation of the aldehyde hydrazones using the readily available and cost effective Langlois reagent (sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate). This reaction is broadly applicable to a series of aromatic aldehyde N&#8208;aminomorpholine hydrazones to give the corresponding C(sp2)&#8208;trifluoromethyl hydrazones in moderate to high yields. The reaction generally tolerates a series of electron&#8208;releasing as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar and Rigid Pyrazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitter for Deep Blue Bright Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two blue donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters containing pyrazine or dipyrazine as electron&#8208;acceptor are presented. The OLEDs based on these two emitters exhibited blue and sky&#8208;blue emission with CIE of (0.15,0.16) and (0.15, 0.30), respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiency for the blue device reached 11.6&#8201;% while for sky blue device it is 7.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) or dipyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz to possess high S1 energies (3.19&#8197;eV and 3.08&#8197;eV, respectively), and relatively large &#916;EST values (0.52&#8197;eV and 0.56&#8197;eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S1 and T1, predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin&#8208;vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states, even the relatively larger &#916;ESTs. The &#916;ESTs for DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz are 0.27&#8197;eV and 0.38&#8197;eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65&#8201;%, and 70&#8201;%, respectively). The decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent with the fact that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on DTCz&#8208;Pz exhibit deep blue emission with &#955;EL of 460&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) reaches 11.6&#8201;%, with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of up to 6892&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, while the device based on DTCz&#8208;DPz exhibits sky blue emission with &#955;EL of 484&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQEmax of 7.2&#8201;%, and Lmax of 8802&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Organocatalytic Amination of Pyrazolones with Azodicarboxylates: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric method for the amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones using azo compounds is described. The developed process exhibits a wide substrate scope and high efficiency in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74&#8211;96&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in the effectivity of the reaction.

         <title>2&#8208;(8&#8208;Iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted Nitronyl Nitroxide: Suppressed Reactivity of Iodine Atom and Unusual Temperature Dynamics of the EPR Spectrum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8211;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet&#8217;s geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify this dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable  a  iso  (  127  I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with  J  = 8 and 14 cm  &#8722;1  (  H = &#8211;2J&#183;S  1  S  2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Debenzylative Sulfonylation of Tertiary Benzylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Syntheses, Structural Characterization, and Kinetic Investigations of Metalla[3]triangulanes: Isoelectronic Nickel(0) and Copper(I) Complexes with Bicyclopropylidene (bcp) and Dicyclopropylacetylene (dcpa) as Ligands</title>

[Ni(bipy)(bcp)], [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6, and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF6 (bcp=1, dcpa=2) could be structurally characterized and the kinetics of the formation of the nickel complexes from [Ni(bipy)(COD)] were analyzed. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and a comparison to related transition metal complexes are presented.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reactions between [Ni(bipy)(COD)] and bicyclopropylidene (bcp), dicyclopropylacetylene (dcpa) and 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;butyne (dmbu) were investigated using stopped&#8208;flow techniques. Similar to previous studies the results support an associative mechanism (activation parameters for bcp: &#916;H#=46&#177;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S#=&#8722;69&#177;8 J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and therefore allowed to postulate a more general reaction mechanism for the reaction pathway. The products, the nickel(0) complexes [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] and [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], could be structurally characterized and the molecular structures are presented. In addition, the corresponding copper(I) complexes [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6 and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF6 were also structurally characterized and their reactivity towards dioxygen was investigated. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and comparisons to similar literature&#8208;known olefinic complexes with transition metals are presented.

         <title>A DFT Study on the Mechanism and Origin of Regioselectivity in the Rhodium/Diene&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of C1&#8208;Substituted Oxabenzonorbornadienes with Arylboronic Acids</title>

         <dc:description>The mechanism and the origin of the regioselectivity of the rhodium/diene&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of C1&#8208;substituted oxabenzonorbornadienes with arylboronic acids has been examined using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The overall mechanism for the reaction is considered as a four&#8208;step reaction including transmetalation, carborhodation, &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination, and protonolysis. The free energy profiles show that the rate&#8208;determining step is involved in the &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination which differs from previous mechanistic studies on metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of oxabenzonorbornadienes. DFT calculations predict the formation of the 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted naphthalene framework is selective over the 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstitued product, in agreement with experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic synthesis of &#8216;picket fence&#8217; porphyrins based on nonplanar macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional &#8216;picket fence&#8217; porphyrin systems have been a topic of interest for their capacity to direct steric shielding effects selectively to one side of the macrocycle. Sterically overcrowded porphyrin systems that adopt macrocycle deformations have recently drawn attention for their applications in organocatalysis and sensing. Here we explore the combined benefits of nonplanar porphyrins and the old molecular design to bring new concepts to the playing field. The challenging  ortho  &#8208;positions of meso&#8208;phenyl residues dodecasubstituted porphyrin systems led us to transition to less hindered  para&#8208;  and  meta  &#8208;sites and develop selective demethylation based on the steric interplay. Isolation of the symmetrical target compound [2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethyl&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dipivaloyloxyphenyl)porphyrin] was investigated under two synthetic pathways. The obtained insight was used to isolate unsymmetrical [2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethyl&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;nitro&#8208;5&#8208;pivaloyloxyphenyl)porphyrin]. Upon separation of the atropisomers, a detailed single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis highlighted intrinsic intermolecular interactions. The nonplanarity of these systems in combination with &#8216;picket fence&#8217; motifs provides an important feature in the design of supramolecular ensembles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective synthesis of Ozanimod, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of a new drug for multiple sclerosis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a short enantioselective synthesis of Ozanimod, a potent modulator of the enzyme Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate receptor (S1P  R  ), recently approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of relapsing&#8208;remitting multiple sclerosis. Amongst different synthetic approaches explored, we achieved the best result introducing the stereogenic centre in the last step via imine asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) using Wills&#8217; catalysts. Besides the reduced numbers of enantiomeric purity controls required, this process culminates in an exceptionally high enantioselective reductive amination obtained with commercially available tethered Ru catalysts . Starting from commercially available 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;indanone, enantiomerically pure Ozanimod was obtained in 5 steps in 62% overall yield and 99% ee.</dc:description>

Besides the reduced numbers of enantiomeric purity controls required, this process culminates in an exceptionally high enantioselective reductive amination obtained with commercially available tethered Ru catalysts . Starting from commercially available 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;indanone, enantiomerically pure Ozanimod was obtained in 5 steps in 62% overall yield and 99% ee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent Ionic Liquid Crystals Based on Naphthalene&#8208;Imidazolium Unit.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we describe an efficient synthesis pathway and the characterization of liquid crystal luminescent imidazolium salts based on a naphthalene unit. The luminescent imidazolium&#8208;naphthalene rigid part is decorated with a benzyl group functionalized by two or three dodecyloxy chains. A crystalline structure shows unambiguously the segregation between the rigid ionic and flexible parts conducive to the emergence of mesomorphic properties. A complete thermotropic properties study of these salts has been carried out according to different anions. The alkyl tail number variation and therefore the amphipathic character (balance between hydrophilic/hydrophobic) makes it possible to induce liquid crystal state with different architectures of self&#8208;organization in layers (Smectic A) or columns (Columnar hexagonal). Finally, the photophysical properties were measured in solution and in the solid state at room temperature and show photoluminescence quantum yields around 20%.</dc:description>

The Cover Feature shows the alkene Bicyclopropylidene (bcp) that became (as well as its derivatives) a versatile C6 building blocks for organic synthesis. It can undergo co&#8208;cyclizations under palladium, nickel, and cobalt catalysis. However, despite the fundamental interest in the mechanism of these reactions, so far only a small number of transition metal complexes with bcp as ligand have been isolated and structurally characterized. Herein, we report the molecular structures of the nickel and copper complexes &#8211; [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6 (anion not shown) &#8211; with bcp and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a co&#8208;ligand.

         <title>The Winding Road towards an Atropo&#8208;enantioselective &#8216;ARYNE Coupling&#8217;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of aryllithiums onto arynes, leading to axially chiral biaryls in the absence of transition metals, was investigated by means of chiral ligands of lithium. Biaryls with a high degree of steric congestion around the aryl&#8211;aryl bond could be obtained.







Abstract
For the first time, the challenging atropo&#8208;enantioselective coupling of in&#8208;situ generated arynes and aryllithiums in the presence of a chiral ligand of lithium was investigated. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept, by affording enantioenriched axially chiral biaryls even in the case of products showing a high degree of steric congestion around the newly created aryl&#8722;aryl bond.

         <dc:description>
2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3&#8197;V vs SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron oxidizing capacity of 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) improves significantly by visible&#8208;light excitation. The exited&#8208;state DDQ (DDQ*) even converts benzene, fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, benzyls, and olefins into their corresponding radical cations as well as chloride and other anions into their radicals. These reactive intermediates have been utilized for the generation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (N, O, or Cl) bonds in the synthesis of valuable organic compounds and natural products. This mini review provides an overview of such DDQ*&#8208;initiated organic transformations with their scope and limitations and discusses the proposed reactions mechanisms.

X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. The cyclic voltammetry suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate. It is the first observation in TTFAQs without TTF moieties.







Abstract
Bis&#8208; and tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer were successfully synthesized. X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. Their average C&#8722;P&#8722;C angles and phosphorus&#8722;carbon distances resemble those of diphenylphosphino&#8208;substituted TTF derivatives. The cyclic voltammograms consisted of one pair of irreversible, simultaneous two&#8208;electron transfer waves. A combination of cyclic voltammetry experiments and DFT calculations suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate.

         <dc:description>Two improved fast, feasible, scalable and economic synthetic protocols for the laboratory scale manufacturing of 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;amine (PicADNP) are described. The previous set of analytical data from an earlier publication could be verified and complemented by additional measurements. The material was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis, DSC and DTA as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. The crystal structure was elucidated and Hirshfeld surface analysis, as well as 2D fingerprint plot analysis for the assessment of sensitivities towards external stimuli was applied. The sensitivity towards shock, friction and electrostatic discharge was also determined experimentally. The performance of the title compound was calculated by applying the EXPLO5 computer code and the theoretical results were compared with the results of SSRT and booster testing experiments. The title compound combines good energetic properties with improved safety characteristics and could find its way into application as a new booster explosive to replace the state of the art material PETN. The optimizations of the synthetic protocol comprise a greener solvent system, shorter reaction times, higher yields for the pure material and a nontoxic byproduct to make the manufacturing process more attractive and better suitable for a subsequent scale up to the technical and industrial scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Prevalent Bioimaging Scaffolds: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin, xanthene, BODIPY, and cyanine are four of the most prevalent bioimaging scaffolds in chemical biology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationships, and imaging applications of fluorophores based on these units. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each scaffold in bioimaging as well as the practical issues to consider when using small organic compounds in biological systems.







Abstract
This minireview describes the syntheses, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationship, and bioimaging applications of fluorescent coumarins, xanthenes, BODIPYs, and cyanines. Advantages and disadvantages of the emissive units are also discussed, as are general practical issues that need to be considered when using fluorophores in a biological setting.

         <title>Diaryliodonium Salts in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Chelation&#8208;Induced C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryliodonium salts have been extensively studied as coupling partners in directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H arylations to obtain aryl/biaryl derivatives. This Minireview summarizes all such developments to provide an overview to the scientific community for further advancements in this area.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Cross&#8208;coupling via directing group assisted C&#8722;H bond activation has become an expedient tool in current synthesis to achieve diverse molecular complexity. In this context, chelation&#8208;assisted arylations of C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bonds have been extensively investigated as aryl/biaryl derivatives are an important contributor in the area of the industry, farming, medicinal and material science. The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini&#8208;review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.

These uncoloured polyaromatic compounds are activated by UV light, at room temperature, being converted through a stilbene&#8208;type electrocyclization into a thermally stable orange species which can be switched back using visible light.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N + &#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N &#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93% ee were obtained via a four step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8208;Harwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Guaianolide Analogs with Enhanced Antiproliferative Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular nitrene transfers to naturally&#8208;occurring guaianolide compounds led to isolating nine new derivatives that possess an amino functional group at C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;10, C&#8208;11, and/or C&#8208;13 positions. The relevance of a late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H amination strategy in medicinal chemistry is demonstrated by the improved antiproliferative activity of the C&#8208;2 aminated analogs of guaianolide products.







Abstract
A set of new guaianolide derivatives (1&#8211;9) was obtained from ludartin, achalensolide, and 11,13&#8208;dihydroachalensolide by application of catalytic nitrene transfer reactions. Intermolecular nitrene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertions led to the amination of C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, and C&#8208;10 positions, while alkene aziridination was also observed under these reaction conditions. The antiproliferative activity of natural compounds and their derivatives was evaluated against a panel of human solid tumor cell lines. The results show that an increase in the biological activity was observed following amination at the C&#8208;2 position of Ludartin, thereby demonstrating the interest in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H amination to improve the bioactivity of natural products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions are very attractive for organic synthesis due to favorable properties of copper such as high relative abundance, low toxicity, low cost, eco&#8208;friendliness, as well as its sustainable and versatile nature. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds such as N&#8208;heterocycles, amines, imines, amides, and alkynes using copper catalysts.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions have received wide attention due to the high relative abundance of copper, its cheap price, low toxicity, eco&#8208;friendliness, sustainable nature, and versatility as a catalyst. Copper catalysts are widely used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling and have found wide applications in heterocyclic chemistry. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of biologically important compounds such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines, amides, imines, and alkynes using copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling and covers literature from 2018 to 2020.

         <title>The Asymmetric Difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convenient, versatile, reliable, and functional&#8208;group tolerant: The Reformatsky reaction! Over 130&#8197;years old, it is still a good choice when synthesis requires the introduction of the difluoroacetate enolate into aldehydes and imines. Appropriately chosen chiral substrates, auxiliaries, or additives enable the creation of the new stereogenic center and make asymmetric syntheses of difluorinated biologically active targets accessible.







Abstract
The structural motif of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;substituted carboxyl and carbonyl groups with hydroxy&#8208; or amino&#8208;substituents at the stereogenic carbon in &#946;&#8208;position is found frequently in drugs and biologically active compounds. A straightforward method for obtaining those targets in high enantiomeric purity is given by asymmetric difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky and imino&#8208;difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky reactions that lead to &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylates or &#946;&#8208;lactams. Three concepts that open a route to this type of compounds are discussed here. Firstly, chiral substrates are able to induce stereoselectivity in the formation of the newly created stereogenic center. Secondly, covalently bound and removable chiral auxiliaries are used in asymmetric syntheses and, thirdly, chiral additives and ligands at the metal direct the addition of the zinc enolate, the Reformatsky reagent, to aldehydes or imines in an enantioselective manner. The review closes with a short discussion of more recently developed difluoro&#8208;aldol reactions that may be considered as alternatives to the Reformatsky procedure.

Secondly, covalently bound and removable chiral auxiliaries are used in asymmetric syntheses and, thirdly, chiral additives and ligands at the metal direct the addition of the zinc enolate, the Reformatsky reagent, to aldehydes or imines in an enantioselective manner. The review closes with a short discussion of more recently developed difluoro&#8208;aldol reactions that may be considered as alternatives to the Reformatsky procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>State of the Art of Bodipy&#8208;Based Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives are important dyes with a variety of applications including functionalized materials, biology, medicine, and organic chemistry. This review covers important developments in the use of Bodipy dyes in synthetic photochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a tremendous research field offering many synthetic possibilities to chemists. Breakthroughs in this area have been notably driven by the implementation of new classes of photocatalysts. Within this context, Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) dyes possess attractive chemical and physical features such as their modularity, strong absorption under visible light irradiation, good thermal and photochemical stabilities, and high fluorescence quantum yields. As such, this class of compounds has found widespread applications in functionalized materials, biology, medicine, or organic chemistry. From an organic&#8208;synthetic point of view, excited states of Bodipy dyes have been harnessed in electron and energy transfer reactions. This minireview collates the relevant literature on the applications of these catalysts in synthetic photochemistry and provides some perspectives of this research area.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <dc:description>
  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
