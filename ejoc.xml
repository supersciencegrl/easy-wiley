         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;Bicyclic Maleimide Skeleton by Addition&#8208;Ring Opening Cascade Reaction of Vinylogous Oxindole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process. This methodology demonstrates significant potential for the synthesis of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide skeleton, which possesses biological or pharmaceutical activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through&#160;Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55%).</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;catalyzed Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Bio&#8208;based Hydroxyurethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective synthesis of carbamates from bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates and amines by using 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) as an organocatalyst is reported. This methodology led to the preparation of a wide range of bio&#8208;sourced hydroxyurethanes from furan&#8208;, carvone&#8208; and limonene&#8208;based scaffolds under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the process allowed us to optimize the catalyst loading with little or no impact on the process regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Directed defluorinative &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of sulfamate esters for synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes via photoredox catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are unique structural motifs with important applications ranging from drugs to materials. Herein, we report a novel radical&#8208;mediated defluorinative allylation of sulfamate esters&#160;with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes through distal C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization under photoredox conditions. The reaction could readily incorporate various gem&#8208;difluoroalkene motifs into previously unfunctionalized sp3 carbon centers. The transformation allows directly dual activation of N&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a photocatalytic and redox&#8208;neutral process, as well as using water as environmentally friendly co&#8208;solvent. The reaction could provide a general and operationally simple method to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkene compounds with high diversity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aryl diazonium salts are versatile compounds known for their reactivity in various transformations. In this study, we explored the arylation of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinones using aryl diazonium salts. The objective was to develop a method for accessing 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, a class of compounds with diverse biological activities and synthetic importance. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the significance of light irradiation for improved yields. The substrate scope investigation demonstrated the compatibility of various diazonium salts and N&#8208;substituents on the 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone scaffold, yielding the corresponding methoxy lactams with high yields. Mechanistic insights were obtained by observing the effect of base and light irradiation. Two initiation mechanisms were proposed: in the presence of a base, the reaction could proceed even without light irradiation, while light irradiation was necessary in the absence of a base. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and provide energetic considerations</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Enzymatic Incorporation of Small Fluorine Modules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organofluorine compounds find extensive application in the fields of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, materials science, and molecular imaging. Introducing fluorine atoms can provide organic compounds with unique physicochemical properties or improve their biological activity. Although significant progress has been made in the chemical synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds, achieving selective fluorination under mild conditions remains extremely challenging. Introducing biocatalytic approaches in organofluorine chemistry is an important strategy given their high efficiency, selectivity, and environmental friendliness. In this review, we present the discovery of fluorinated natural products and fluorinases, the crystal structure and the directed evolution of fluorinases, with a focus on recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds in recent years. It is hoped that this review will help to promote the field of biocatalytic organofluorine compound synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of a Planar&#8211;Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane via Michael Addition to Nitroolefins Catalyzed by N&#8208;Terminal Guanidinylated Helical Peptide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal guanidinylated resin&#8211;supported helical peptides were found to catalyze the kinetic resolution of a planarly chiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2] paracyclophane via asymmetric Michael addition with an s&#8208;factor reaching up to 111.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2]paracyclophane based on N&#8208;terminal&#8211;guanidinylated resin&#8211;bound helical peptide catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of malonate esters was developed. This approach provides a new pathway to enantiopure paracyclophane derivatives characterized by both planar and central chirality, along with the recovery of the chiral substrate with a selectivity factor of up to 111. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the resulting products has been showcased through their successful transformation into derivatives of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid.

         <dc:description>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8211;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale. A potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor H3B&#8208;968 was also synthesized by this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring an Optimised Approach for Converting 6&#8208;Thioguanosine Derivatives to Asymmetric Disulphides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present the systematic analysis of conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine derivatives into unsymmetrical disulphides. Within the work we explored three known strategies for the preparation of disulphide bonds for 6&#8208;thioguanosine and its phosphorylated derivatives. We have shown that obtained derivatives are stable under certain conditions and can be easily further expanded using various tags depending on need.







Abstract
Here we present a systematic analysis of the synthesis of unsymmetrical disulphides employing 6&#8208;thioguanosine and its mono&#8208; and dinucleotides by three of the most common strategies: a nucleophilic substitution of the thiol, a thiol exchange reaction with another disulphide and oxidative dehydrogenation coupling reactions of S&#8722;H bonds. The exchange reaction was found to be the most efficient approach and could be used not only for nucleosides but also for nucleotides.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation reaction of N&#8208;sulfinylanilines with vinylethylene carbonates and vinyl epoxides is developed. It affords 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides under mild reaction conditions through allylic palladium intermediates. The versatile synthetic utility of 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides in preparing sulfoxides, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and substituted amines has also been demonstrated.

A CAN mediated oxidative coupling of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds to 2&#8208;arylchromenes followed by cyclization affords tetrahydro&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]chromenones with regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity in high yield.







Abstract
A promising and useful method has been accomplished for regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]chromenones through ceric(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) mediated oxidative coupling of cyclic/acyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds to 2&#8208;aryl/heteroarylchromenes followed by a base assisted cyclization. The significant features of the method encircle easy accessibility of the starting materials, high air stability and low toxicity of oxidant CAN, high product yield, operationally simple and eco&#8208;friendly reaction conditions. Trapping of a radical intermediate with radical scavenger TEMPO (detected by LC&#8211;MS) from the reaction mixture proved that the oxidative coupling is a radical mediated process.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8211;pot method has been developed for the synthesis of chromeno fused pyridine/quinolinone derivatives. The reactions proceeded through the formation C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds to form the title compounds. The bio&#8211;active compound 6H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;b] quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;one has been prepared by this protocol.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot approach has been developed for the preparation of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;5H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;b] pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates and 6H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;b] quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones by reacting 2&#8208;((benzylimino/phenylimino)&#8208;methyl) phenols with ethyl/methyl propiolate in presence of La(OTf)3 under thermal conditions. The reactions proceeded through the formation C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds to form the title compounds.

         <title>Trifluoromethylsulfinylation Reaction of Activated Arenes and Indoles with Trifluoromethanesulfinyl Chloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of activated arenes with trifluoromethanesulfinyl chloride in the presence of Lewis acid was developed. The protocol could be expanded to the perfluoroalkylsulfinylation of activated arenes, as well as the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of indoles without additive.







Abstract
The trifluoromethylsulfinylation reaction of activated arenes with trifluoromethanesulfinyl chloride (CF3SOCl) in the presence of Lewis acid was achieved under mild and solvent&#8208;free conditions. A series of aryl trifluoromethyl sulfoxides were obtained in moderate to high yields. The protocol could be extended to the perfluoroalkylsulfinylation of activated arenes, as well as the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of indoles without additive.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Carboxamides and Ketones from [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient method for acylation of [1.1.1]propellane to give bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) carboxamides and ketones has been developed. It provides a straightforward one&#8208;step access to monosubstituted BCP carboxamides, synthesis of which requires multiple chemical steps in previous reports.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) carboxamides are prepared from the direct addition of [1.1.1]propellane with semicarbazides in the presence of iron(II) phthalocyanine {Fe(Pc)} and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in moderate to good yields. BCP ketones are also obtained under similar conditions in moderate yields. This protocol provides a straightforward one&#8208;step access to BCP carboxamides, synthesis of which requires multiple chemical steps in previous reports.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Azadibenzo[a,e]pyrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different isomeric azadibenzo[a,e]pyrenes are prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization and Pd&#8208;catalysed CH&#8208;activation reactions. The optical and electrochemical properties are studied by experimental and theoretical methods.







Abstract
Four different isomeric azadibenzo[a,e]pyrenes (benzo[4,10]anthra[9,1&#8208;gh]isoquinolines and benzo[4,10]anthra[1,9&#8208;fg]isoquinolines) were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization and Pd&#8208;catalysed CH&#8208;activation reactions. The optical properties have been studied by steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopy in different solvents and during acid titration. Trifluoroacetic acid protonation strongly affects absorption and emission properties, with variations depending on the position of the nitrogen atom of the specific compound. Electrochemical analysis showed distinct oxidation and reduction potentials. DFT calculations provided further insights into electronic properties.

         <title>Formylation of Propargylic Alcohols with Difluorocarbene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for the formylation reaction of propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate under mild conditions. It is the first example of the use of difluorocarbene as a carbonyl source and the reaction of propargylic alcohols to form formates.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of propargylic formates from propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is reported. In the reaction, sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is used as a difluorocarbene precursor and a formylating reagent to provide a carbonyl source, while the triple bond of propargylic alcohols is not involved. The method shows convenient operation, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208;selectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Photochemical Characterization of Indolizine Fluorophores Obtained by a Multicomponent Palladium Iodide&#8722;Catalyzed Oxidative Aminocarbonylation Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides with fluorescent properties are obtained in a multicomponent fashion starting from simple building blocks (2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds, CO, amines, and oxygen) through a sequential PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation &#8211; cyclization &#8211; aromatization process. Initially formed 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, ensuing from Pd&#8208;catalyzed triple bond oxidative aminocarbonylation, are converted in&#8197;situ into the final products by amine&#8208;promoted intramolecular dearomative conjugate addition followed by rearomatization.







Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative method for the direct, multicomponent synthesis of indolizine fluorophores has been developed. The process is based on the PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds leading to the corresponding 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, followed in&#8197;situ by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization (by amine&#8208;promoted conjugate addition of the pyridine ring nitrogen) and aromatization, to give the finally isolated N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides. Reactions are carried out under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture CO&#8722;air for 6&#8211;15&#8197;h) in MeCN as the solvent and with a low catalyst loading (0.33&#8197;mol% PdI2), in the presence of 0.5 equiv. of KI and 3 equiv. of a secondary amine. The optical properties of representative 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamide products have also been investigated.

Fluorinated triarylboranes are employed as a metal free and sustainable catalysts for alkylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.







Abstract
Fluorinated triarylboranes have shown a breadth of reactivity as catalysts for organic transformations, particularly in carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions. Herein we report a facile, metal&#8208;free synthetic route for the addition of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones using B(C6F5)3 as a metal&#8208;free catalyst. 25 examples of reactions leading to products in up to 97&#8201;% yield are reported. DFT studies show the role of B(C6F5)3 and hydrogen shuttling in the mechanism of this Michael alkylation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Thioesters from Amides and Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed practical and simple synthesis of thioesters from amides and disulfides has been developed. Diverse substituted aromatic amides are capable of coupling with diaryl or dialkyl disulfides via C&#8722;N/S&#8722;S cleavage to produce the desirable thioesters in moderate to good yields. This procedure features cheap metals, novel and easily preparative substrates, providing a simple and practical access to a variety of thioesters without toxic thiols or CO gas.

The bicyclic guanidine 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was used as a catalyst to develop a method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;alkylidenephthalides and amines. This method provides a rapid and more sustainable option with broad scope for the synthesis of such scaffolds.







Abstract
The readily available organocatalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was used for the rapid synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;alkylidenephthalides. The transformation occurs at room temperature and requires less solvent than traditional methods, providing a more sustainable synthetic option to access 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with broad scope. Elaboration of the products to diverse scaffolds as well as synthesis of biologically active compounds are demonstrated.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation Reactions with Glycerol and Carbohydrates as Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed transfer hydrogenation using non&#8208;toxic, low cost and renewable biomass as hydrogen donors represents a sustainable and promising approach for the reduction of organic compounds. In this context, glycerol and carbohydrates are attractive hydrogen donors. In this review, we explore various catalytic systems that have been reported for reducing various unsaturated compounds, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with biomass in transfer hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation is a practical approach for reduction of various unsaturated compounds and an alternative to pressurised hydrogenation and traditional metal hydride reagents. Among the various hydrogen donors, biomass such as glycerol and carbohydrates received considerable attention for the reduction reactions due to their non&#8208;toxic, eco&#8208;friendly and renewable nature. The present review addresses the development of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, alkenes, alkynes, nitro compounds, CO2 etc. using glycerol and carbohydrates as potential hydrogen donors.

         <title>Allure of HFIP in Unsaturated Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review emphasizes the versatility and significance of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, primality focusing on the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds (alkenes, alkynes, and allenes). The complexity of its mechanisms adds depth to its utility beyond conventional solvent applications.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) stands out as a versatile solvent in synthetic chemists&#8217; repertoire, facilitating a diverse array of intricate chemical reactions. It demonstrates a multifaceted role that extends beyond conventional uses and, in many cases, the mechanism appears to be complicated. This feature article elucidates the significance of HFIP in the context of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a specific emphasis on the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Cp2Fe&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Synthesis of Functionalized Compounds: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 12, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on Cp2Fe&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis of diverse functionalized compounds with the newly formed C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;P, and C&#8722;O bonds over the past decade.







Abstract
Unlike traditional organic methods, electrosynthesis has emerged as an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach to generate a series of functionalized compounds. In this process, the traceless electron serves as the redox agent, eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants or reductants. In contrast to direct electrolysis, redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis has the ability to overcome kinetic inhibitions and achieve diverse selectivity under mild conditions. This has garnered increasing attention from the synthetic community, especially in the past few years. This review will focus on Cp2Fe&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis of diversified functionalized compounds through C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;P and C&#8722;O bond formation over the past decade.

         <title>On the Substrate Scope of Dimethylsulfonium Propionate Lyases toward Dimethylsulfoxonium Propionate Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six DMSP lyases were investigated for their potential to cleave synthetic DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains into sulfoxides and acrylate. The pH dependency and enzyme kinetics of these reactions were determined, showing efficient transformation by four of the studied DMSP lyases.







Abstract
The six dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP) lyases DddQ, DddW, DddP, DddY, DddK and DddL catalyze the elimination of dimethyl sulfide from DMSP and can also cleave the marine metabolite dimethylsulfoxonium propionate (DMSOP) to DMSO and acrylate. In this study the potency of all six enzymes for the conversion of four DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains that were synthesized in three steps from 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid was investigated. For this purpose, the pH dependency of the enzyme reactions was determined, showing optimal conditions at pH&#8197;8 for all enzymes but DddP, for which an optimum of pH&#8197;6 was found. Efficient transformations were observed for DddQ, DddW, DddY and DddK, for which the Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics were determined for all four substrate analogs. HPLC analysis of the dialkylsulfoxides obtained with the most efficient enzyme DddW revealed that these compounds were obtained with a low to moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 25&#8201;% ee), demonstrating that this enzyme has a preference for one of the enantiomers of the DMSOP analogs.

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Carbonyl Amination of Fluorinated Olefins for Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an example of the carbonylation of fluorinated olefins to trifluoromethacrylamide catalyzed by palladium. By optimizing reaction conditions, we can obtain different amide compounds, including alkyl acrylamide. Aromatic acrylamide and heterocyclic acrylamide. This method has good substrate adaptability and functional group tolerance, and is expected to be used for the synthesis of key amides in fields such as medicine.







Abstract
Acrylamides are a class of important organic compounds that play key roles in biomedical chemistry, materials science, life science, and other fields. Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of trifluoromethyl, the synthesis of trifluoromethylated acrylamides, especially those containing double bonds, has long been a challenge. Here, we report an example of the formation of trifluoromethyl acrylamides through palladium catalyzedcarbonylation of fluorinated olefins. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we can obtain different amide compounds, including alkyl acrylamides. aromatic acrylamides and heterocyclic acrylamides. This method has good substrate adaptability and functional group tolerance,so it is expected to be used in the synthesis of key amides in the fields of medicine and other fields.

         <title>SO2F2&#8208;Mediated&#160;Thioesterification of Carboxylic Acids with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic&#160;thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic&#160;thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late-stage&#160;modification of drug molecules rac-Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram-scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Based Enantiomerism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat, tri&#8208;coordinate boron rears its had, becomes tetra&#8208;coordinate and chiral! When treated in an appropriate manner, it forms enantiomers that are configurationally stable. Only since recently, boron&#8208;stereogenic complexes are accessible by catalytic enantioselective syntheses. What makes this particularly exciting is that tetra&#8208;coordinate boron compounds are considered promising light&#8208;emitting materials.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based enantiomerism is fragile due to the inherent tendency of a dissociation of a ligand from tetra&#8208;coordinate chiral boron complexes under formation of the achiral tri&#8208;coordinate species. This review will present the different approaches in overcoming the inherent tendency of racemization in boron&#8208;stereogenic compounds. When embedded in an environment of chiral ligands or substituents, configurationally stable boron stereogenic centers can form in a diastereoselective manner. Compounds incorporating boron as the exclusive stereogenic center are obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures. The recently developed &#8211; much more efficient &#8211; methods of a catalytic, enantioselective creation of boron stereogenic compounds are highlighted in this review. Finally the chiroptical properties of enantiomerically pure boron complexes that makes them promising materials or devices are addressed.

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Pyranicin and 4&#8208;Epi&#8208;Pyranicin from Carbohydrate Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

         <title>Reactivity of Biomass&#8208;Derived Olefins with Elemental Sulfur: Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of biomass&#8208;derived aryl olefins with elemental sulfur was studied at 180 and 230&#8201;&#176;C and at three different sulfur/organic substrate ratios. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8722;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8722;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission.







Abstract
Lignocellulosic biomass remains underutilized despite its annual production in gigaton quantities. Sulfur is another vastly underutilized waste product of fossil fuel refining. New mechanistic insight into the reactions of sulfur unveiled since 2020 suggest a rich and hitherto unexplored chemistry between biomass&#8208;derived olefins and elemental sulfur. In this study, four biomass&#8208;derived olefins (eugenol (1), 4&#8208;allyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenol (2), o&#8208;eugenol (3), and 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;6&#8208;methylphenol (4)) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios (2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and at two temperatures (180&#8201;&#176;C or 230&#8201;&#176;C). Product mixtures were characterized using 1H NMR spectrometry and GC&#8208;MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8722;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8722;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.

Based on control experiments and IR identification of intermediates, we proposed a plausible reaction mechanism.

         <title>Photoinduced Generation of Active Intermediates from Unmodified 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the advancements in the site&#8208;specific activation of unmodified 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via photoinduction, focusing on two activation mechanisms. The first involves photoinduced redox reactions, activating the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. The second occurs via absorption of photons in the enol form or energy transfer through a photocatalyst, leading to an excited&#8208;state transition and subsequent reactions such as 6&#960; cyclization or the de Mayo reaction.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes light as the initial driving force for chemical reactions, enabling reactions with high energy barriers in traditionally thermal chemistry to proceed under mild conditions. 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds occur as important active molecules in nature and are intermediates in pharmaceutical syntheses. In recent years, there have been numerous studies of these compounds, and it is common practice to pre&#8208;modify them before the reaction, which is, however, unfavorable for the atom economy of the process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in the site&#8208;specific activation of unmodified 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds by photoinduction. The focus is on elucidating the mechanisms of these reactions to provide insights and directions for future research in designing novel reactions.

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;Derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo&#8208;retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO2 furnishes bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2 in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R or S) and an amino acid (D or L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2 results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Decarboxylative Amination of SMAHOs by Dialkyl Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives. The reaction can be performed under mild reaction conditions using 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a catalyst and displayed a rather important scope.







Abstract
The decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates is described. The reaction was promoted by 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organocatalyst in heated toluene. High yields of the coupling products were generally obtained, and the scope of the reaction proved rather important with the potential presence of functionalized side chains at the &#945;&#8208;position, affording an original access to &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model a&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercial transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky amines.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;,&#160;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6 &#8208; &gt;99% ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99% ee and up to 40% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a&#160;cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4

Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study.&#160; Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.</dc:description>

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and&#160;fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel antiprotozoal drugs acting on new targets or by&#160;novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential&#160;of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme&#160;chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was proposed. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes,&#160;the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation, and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds&#160;as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in vitro against cultures of&#160;Leishmania&#160;and&#160;Plasmodium&#160;and using the human cell line HepG2.</dc:description>

The reaction involved the combination effect of TBAB (PTC) and K2S2O8 with the addition of the amine to phthalaldehyde and 2,2&#8208;dihydroxyindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione to generate isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one in&#8208;situ, followed by cyclization.This lactamization process facilitated the formation of C&#8211;N bonds under controllable and ambient reaction conditions. A variety of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(substituted)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones were successfully synthesized through a radical pathway from isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one, involving C&#8208;C bond formation. The method demonstrated high functional group compatibility and a wide substrate scope, resulting in moderate to good yields of the desired products. Additionally, the mechanistic analyses demonstrated that isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one&#160; might be a significant intermediate being involved in the reaction.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Alkyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under 400&#8197;nm visible light irradiation, primary and secondary alkyl chlorides can be activated in the presence of bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron and an tert&#8208;butoxide to form alkyl radicals, which then react with diboron(4) compounds to afford alkylboronic esters. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and practical approach to valuable alkylboronic ester intermediates.







Abstract
The traditional method for the preparation of alkylboronic esters involves transition metal catalysis or transition metal&#8208;free methods relying on single electron transfer. Each method relies on the suitable choice of catalyst or electron transfer mediator. In this study, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of alkylboronic esters from alkyl chlorides and diboron(4) compounds, without the need for additional metal or non&#8208;metal catalysts. We discovered that under 400&#8197;nm visible light irradiation, alkyl chlorides can be activated in the presence of bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron and an alkoxide base to form alkyl radical intermediates, which then react with diboron(4) compounds, resulting in high yields of alkylboronic esters. The reaction is applicable to both primary and secondary alkyl chlorides. The simplicity of operation and the broad substrate scope of this method make it practical for the synthesis of valuable alkylboronic ester intermediates.

Abstract
We report here a catalyst&#8208;free, (sp2)C&#8722;H imination reaction of in&#8208;situ formed imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones. This one&#8208;pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2&#8208;diketones are also described.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Direct Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfurol with Maleimides in a Bio&#8208;Based Green Solvent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upconversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfurol through a direct Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with maleimides in 2&#8208;Me&#8208;THF enabled the construction of various heterocyclic compounds, while switching the reaction selectivity depending on the temperature.







Abstract
Environmental concern has motivated an inclination to exploit waste and upgrade it into high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals. Biomass is an excellent carbon source that provides a variety of raw materials as building blocks, such as furans. Herein, we report the upcycling of furfurol, a known biomass by&#8208;product, through a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition with maleimides that is performed in a green bio&#8208;derived solvent, 2&#8208;MeTHF. We provide two alternative sets of reaction conditions to promote exo or endo selectivity, which depends on the temperature employed. A variety of products were obtained in 70&#8211;96&#8201;% yield and high exo selectivity at 80&#8201;&#176;C, while a 30&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8208;45&#8201;:&#8201;55 exo/endo ratio was produced at room temperature. A large&#8208;scale reaction was also performed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;Fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;Fluoroalkenylation of Naphthalenes by C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

         <title>A Practical, Scalable Synthesis of 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX)</title>

         <dc:description>
1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX) emerged as a promising paclitaxel prodrug, thanks to its high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed. It affords the product with high purity and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.







Abstract
Paclitaxel is one of the most important chemotherapy agents and it has shown activity against a variety of human cancers. In the past years several derivatives and formulations have been developed to improve its activity and reduce its toxicity. Recently, 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX), obtained by conjugation of paclitaxel with a long&#8208;chain diacid, has emerged as a promising paclitaxel prodrug, with high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed and is herein described. The approach is based on the mono&#8208;allyl protection of octadecanedioic acid (ODDA) and on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed removal of the allyl ester after coupling with paclitaxel. This strategy is superior to previously reported procedures in that it affords the ODDA&#8208;PTX product with much higher purity, avoids chromatographic purifications and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.

         <dc:description>A novel catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;controlled dimerization of aliphatic alkynones through tandem Michael addition/rearrangement/cyclization sequence has been developed. The elaborated protocol provides a convenient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to rare 3(2H)&#8208;furanones decorated with 2&#8208;exo&#8208;methylene and 4&#8208;ethenyl functionalities. A comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes has revealed the Janus&#8208;like behavior of the employed sodium tert&#8208;butoxide/toluene system that is responsible both for the chemoselectivity of the initial addition step and the inhibition of the final cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization of Styrenes and Acrylates in Molten Tetrabutylammonium Acetate as an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: A method for the selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates has been developed. The reaction is catalyzed by a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate without the need for any additional ligand. The use of this method enabled the coupling of substituted vinyl arenes in reasonable yields to give exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8208;10 h. Acrylates, on the other hand, exhibit higher reactivity, and the use of dibutyl acrylate resulted in the quantitative synthesis of dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. This selectivity is unprecedented in the literature. The role of the ionic liquid and the different catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were also elucidated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The multicomponent assembly of a nitrile&#8208;based directing group in a set of arylacetic acids under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions using the Passerini 3&#8208;CR and the subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H bond olefination process has been achieved.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes via Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes represent a distinctive class of organic molecules characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, chiral allenes play a significant role in modern chemistry. They not only serve as pivotal frameworks for natural products and drug molecules but also are essential building blocks in organic synthesis. Over the years, numerous remarkable and efficient methods have been developed for the synthesis of chiral allenes. Notably, the catalytic synthesis of chiral allenes using transition metals in conjunction with chiral ligands has garnered considerable attention. This review paper aims to provide an overview of recent advancements in the synthesis of chiral allenes through asymmetric 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes, in which two distinct strategies including non&#8208;radical and radical processes are highlighted.</dc:description>

This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N&#8208;centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyhalogenated Carbohydrates: Synthesis and Applications of Sugar Halides from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The societal importance of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) doesn't fade over time. This review focuses on the synthesis and applications of polyhalogenated carbohydrates incorporating fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. An overview of the current state of the art of sugar inter&#8208;halides is also presented.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated carbohydrates have attracted attention in the last decades. This is due to the interesting properties of such organofluorines. What about the other halogens? Since the discovery of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) more than 50&#8197;years ago, only a handful of chlorinated, brominated, or iodinated carbohydrates have been reported. This review focuses on the synthesis of polyhalogenated carbohydrates, including sugar inter&#8208;halides, but excluding polyfluorinated sugars. An overview of the current state of the art of their potential application is also described.

         <title>Uranyl&#8208;Organic Framework as Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalyst for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Heterogeneous Hydroacylation of Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond conversion at room temperature using heterogeneous visible&#8208;light catalysts is both interesting and challenging. Herein, we disclosed visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates using uranyl&#8208;organic framework [UO2(OH)(cpt)]n (Ucpt, Hcpt = 4&#8208;(4'&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as an efficient heterogeneous hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst. In this procedure, diverse benzaldehydes are compatible using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent at room temperature, achieving direct conversion of C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond with excellent yields (up to 99%). The key to excellent catalytic activity lies in the fact that the coordination of the conjugated ligand changes the HOMO energy level of Ucpt, resulting in more active sites and longer&#8208;lived photo excitons. Simultaneously, this heterogeneous photocatalyst can be easily separated and reused for seven successive cycles and maintain high catalytic activity, showing outstanding sustainability and recyclability.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.</dc:description>

         <title>[N&#8211;I&#8211;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8211;I&#8211;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8211;I&#8211;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of Kyonggic Acids in Massilia spp.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, bacteria of the genus Massilia have been identified as promising sources of bioactive natural products. In this study, we used mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based molecular networking for the first comprehensive analysis of the secondary metabolome of these microorganisms. Annotation of the detected metabolite clusters with a mass fragmentation database revealed several compounds not previously known to be produced by Massilia species. To secure sufficient material for further structural analyses as well as biological testing, we selected the most promising producer strains from our molecular networking analysis and subjected them to larger&#8208;scale cultivation. Following extraction and UV&#8208;directed isolation, we obtained five metabolites in milligram quantities. In addition to a cyclic dipeptide, we elucidated the structures of four acyl amino acids that are related to thalassotalic acid C from the marine bacterium Thalassotalea sp. The Massilia&#8208;derived kyonggic acids were found to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis influencing skin and hair pigmentation. This study illustrates the value of combining spectroscopic and computational tools in natural product discovery in order to detect and guide the isolation of previously overlooked bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Peroxidation of Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls (cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones, and Meldrum&#8216;s acids) towards metal/hydroperoxide system was disclosed. An efficient method for the peroxidation of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids with TBHP has been developed using Co2+ salt as a catalyst. Cycle cleavage, expected from previous reports for cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls, was observed only for cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones. Overall, this work extends the understanding of metal&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation towards different structural motifs.







Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls (cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids) with TBHP has been disclosed. A series of the alkylperoxy derivatives of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids were synthesized in moderate to good yields (13&#8211;86&#8201;%). The functionalization of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones by the tBuOO group was performed with high selectivity in the presence of the cocktail of reactive oxidizing species, including metal and radical intermediates. The key species in the peroxidation process are probably the tert&#8208;butylperoxy radical or its Co(III) complex, which are generated from the Co(II)/TBHP system. Cycle cleavage, which would be expected for cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls based on previous reports, was observed to a large extent only for cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones.

         <title>Recent Advances of 2&#8208;Nitroglycals as Powerful Glycosyl Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advance of 2&#8208;nitroglycals from 2014 to 2023. A plethora of applications on the synthesis of bioactive compounds via Michael&#8211;type addition, sugar ring opening reaction, Ferrier rearrangement were summarized. Organo&#8211;catalysis glycosylation plays a pivotal role in these applications.







Abstract
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advances of 2&#8208;nitroglycals including its synthetic methods and its applications. Using 2&#8208;nitroglycals, 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, nitro&#8208;polyol derivatives, sugar&#8208;furan derivatives, sugar&#8208;pyrrole molecules, 2,3&#8208;diaminoglycosides and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithioglycosides were obtained via Michael&#8211;type addition, retro&#8208;Henry&#8208;type reaction, C1/C3&#8208;Ferrier rearrangement and [3+2] N&#8208;heterocyclic addition. Most of these conversions are achieved via mild organo&#8208;catalysis glycosylation methods.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkene&#8208;Bound Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a selective, mild method for the visible light&#8208;photocatalyzed trifluoromethylation and cyclization of unactivated tethered alkenes to provide tri&#8208; and tetracyclic quinazolinones. Trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride are inexpensive and readily available reagents for the process which proceeds without the addition of a strong oxidant. Broad substrate scope and the formation of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings are demonstrated in 44&#8208;82% yields. Control experiments provide the basis for a proposed mechanism involving photocatalyzed SET from fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 to TFAA, and trifluoromethyl radical&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization. The practicality of the protocol was illustrated by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis in 76% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8722;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reveal here a metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP).&#160;&#160; The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing g&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8211;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending on the nucleophile. The reaction is initiated by a halogen&#8208;sulfur bond that causes C&#8211;S bond cleavage. Moreover, the reaction with iodine proceeds through homoallyl iodide intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Urea&#8208;, Thiourea&#8208;, and Isothiourea&#8208;Based Bifunctional Tetraarylphosphonium Salt Catalysis for Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the development of bifunctional organocatalysts for the reaction of epoxides with atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide. Isothiourea, thiourea, and urea groups are effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Computational mechanistic studies disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.







Abstract
A novel bifunctional isothiourea derived from a tetraarylphosphonium salt catalyzes the coupling reaction of monosubstituted epoxides with 1&#8197;atm of carbon dioxide to afford five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates in high yields. Thiourea and urea groups are also effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies on this catalysis using theoretical calculations disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Alkylsulfanyl)quinolines from Aryl Isothiocyanates and Allenes or Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and convenient approach to new families of variously substituted 2&#8208;(alkylsulfanyl)quinolines, which are difficult to access via traditional methods for quinolines synthesis, is reported. Allenes or alkynes, aryl isothiocyanates, and alkylating agents have been shown to be readily available building blocks for the one&#8208;pot assembly of functionalized quinoline systems.







Abstract
In this work, a conceptually novel approach to diversely substituted 2&#8208;(alkylsulfanyl)quinolines is described. The approach includes the assembly of the target molecules from allenic or acetylenic carbanions, aromatic isothiocyanates, and alkylating agents. The process proceeds in a single synthetic operation via the formation and 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;trienes, R2R3C=C=C(R1)C(SAlk)=NAr, with the participation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond of the phenyl group and the azadiene fragment of the azatrienic system.

         <title>Reactivity of Electrophilic Trifluoromethylating Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order rate constants for the reactions of Umemoto's reagents I (X=H) and II (X=F) with carbanions follow the correlation lg k2=sN(N+E) and allow to calculate their electrophilic reactivity parameters E. The reactivities of Togni's hypervalent iodine&#8208;based CF3 transfer reagents do not follow this correlation.







Abstract
Kinetics of the reactions of colored carbanions (reference nucleophiles) with S&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium ions (Umemoto's reagents) and hypervalent trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted iodine compounds (Togni's reagents) have been determined photometrically using stopped&#8208;flow techniques. The second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#8201;&#176;C) for the reactions of Umemoto's sulfonium ions (generation I and II) with the reference nucleophiles in DMSO follow the correlation lg&#160;k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E) and can be used to determine the electrophilicity parameters E of these trifluoromethylating reagents. It is shown that the conditions reported for the reactions of Umemoto's generation I reagents with a variety of C&#8208;nucleophiles are in line with the electrophilicity parameter E&#8776;&#8722;13 determined for these reagents. Though Togni's hypervalent iodine&#8208;based trifluoromethylation reagents do not follow this linear free energy relationship, the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions indicate that they cover the same reactivity range as Umemoto's generation I and II reagents.

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Responsive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Quinoxaline Emitters for Luminescent Solar Concentrators: Potential Integration in Agrivoltaic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>the integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaic, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a PMMA matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Strategy for the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Crambescin B Decarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crambescin B decarboxylate is an inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium&#8208;channel and a potential biochemical tool. Herein, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of crambescin B decarboxylate using a new synthetic strategy. The key aspects of this new protocol include: 1) the use of an optically pure epoxide, synthesized by the Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, as the starting material for guanidino&#8208;aziridine, and 2) the introduction of the THF ring through nucleophilic substitution using an acyl anion equivalent. The synthetic protocol reported herein is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined the cytotoxicity and protective effects of crambescin B decarboxylate in mouse&#8208;hippocampus&#8208;derived neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. In addition, crambescin B decarboxylate protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report triflic anhydride mediated synthesis of ureas starting from hydroxamic acids. The scope of triflic anhydride was also expanded to encompass carbamates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to activation of hydroxamic acid derivative of dipeptide giving &#945;&#8208;uriedopeptidomimetics in good yield. The mechanistic study of reaction was carried out by DFT. This study is important because it demonstrates that Tf2O has the potential to be effective when used on a substrate that possesses amide bond. A broad substrate scope and mild conditions render this protocol a promising approach to the synthesis of diverse types of ureas.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ&#160;NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an&#160;automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5 mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored&#160;in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine&#160;ex&#8208;situ&#160;analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35 &#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibits a smaller RMSD, which indicates a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pyrazolone moiety bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center is frequent in biologically active products and pharmaceuticals. The catalytic route for the construction of a quaternary carbon center possesses challenges. In this report, catalytic asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones catalysed by primary amine&#8208;Br&#248;nsted acid composite has been developed. An array of pyrazolone derivatives bearing vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in moderate to good diastereoselectivities (up to 92:8 dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99% ee). In addition, antipode for enantiomers of the pyrazolone derivatives were also be realized in good to high stereoselectivities (up to 92:8 dr and up to 98% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations on Superbase Mediated Reactivity of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones with Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of&#160; &#160;2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of&#160;an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Transformation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclooctadiene into Novel Functionalized Azaheterocycles, &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters, and Lactams by Means of Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and&#160; current challenges to overcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Polyheterocycles from Nitroarenes and Glycols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Vinyl&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives Functionalized with Two 2,6&#8208;Dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Units</title>

Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene functionalized two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units have been successfully synthesized, and characterized by X&#8208;ray structural analyses, cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and emission spectroscopies.







Abstract
Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) functionalized with two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units (3&#8201;a&#8211;c) have been successfully synthesized. Cyclic voltammograms of all the derivatives are composed of three pairs of redox waves. The first and second redox waves correspond to one&#8208;electron transfer processes, in which the extended TTF moiety participated predominantly. The third redox wave corresponded to a two&#8208;electron transfer process, in which the two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units were involved. The redox potentials at which the tetracations of 3&#8201;a&#8211;c were generated were considerably more negative than expected, probably due to the formation of stable closed&#8208;shell structures by conjugation between 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of 3&#8201;b, 3&#8201;c, and (3b2+)(Sb2Cl82&#8722;)(C6H5OCH3) revealed that the vinyl&#8208;extended TTF moiety in all the compounds adopts an almost planar structure, while the phosphinine units are significantly rotated relative to the extended TTF plane. The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the emission intensity of 3&#8201;b was very small in both the neutral and oxidized states.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a new application of fluorosulfonylazide (FSO2N3) for diazotizing a series of activated methylene compounds to deliver the corresponding diazo products. Notably, by the judicious choice of bases, the selective generation of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) or the Seyferth&#8722;Gilbert reagent (SGR) has been realized from FSO2N3 and dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropylphosphonate. We also investigated the kinetics of the homologation of aldehydes using these two reagents with K2CO3 as a base in MeOH, finding that a faster reaction rate was achieved by using SGR. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

         <title>Practical and Divergent Synthesis of Carbocyclic Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion through a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed to synthesize a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed via a base build&#8208;up strategy to the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophane&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung of N&#8208;Bromoimides for Dibromination of Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source, wherein a new type of catalytic umpolung strategy of N&#8208;bromoimides is revealed. The mechanistic investigation revealed that in&#8197;situ generated 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene was the actual catalyst, which was responsible for the catalytic umpolung of NBS.







Abstract
A thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source has been developed, providing a low&#8208;cost and mild methodology for preparing vicinally dibrominated compounds from electron&#8208;neutral or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanistic investigation showed that 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of thiophane with NBS was the actual catalyst, which reversed the polarity of NBS to yield bromide ion.

         <dc:description>The formyl C&#8208;H thiolation of aldehydes using thiosulfonates using the decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst is reported. Using this photocatalytic protocol, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields.

The transformation involves gold-catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid-promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position.

         <title>Simple and Efficient Method for Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Amination of Polypyridine N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and convenient one&#8211;pot procedure for reductive ortho&#8211;amination of pyridyl N&#8208;oxides is described, using potassium phthalimide and tosyl chloride followed by hydrolysis. The scope and applicability of the reaction was demonstrated, providing various mono&#8208; and di&#8208;aminated products in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein we report a simple synthetic route towards both known and novel aminated polypyridyl ligands. The use of tosyl chloride in combination with potassium phthalimide followed by hydrolysis allows for chemo&#8211;selective ortho&#8211;amination of (poly)pyridyl mono&#8208; and di&#8208;N&#8208;oxides with good to excellent yield. The reactions are scalable and reproducible while using inexpensive, commercially available reagents.

         <title>Unsymmetrical Anthracene Platforms as Singlet Oxygen Batteries: Effects of Substituents on Photooxygenation and Endoperoxide Thermolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical anthracene derivatives have been synthetized and demonstrated a good ability to capture, store and release singlet oxygen (1O2). Kinetic studies performed by UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy revealed the influence of the substituents on the photooxygenation and the thermal cycloreversion steps. These derivatives appeared as promising 1O2 batteries for dark photooxygenation.







Abstract
Aromatic architectures able to capture, store and release singlet oxygen have sparked the interest of the scientific community as an attractive strategy to generate singlet oxygen. Among these structures, anthracenes are efficient singlet oxygen batteries with applications in various fields such as chemistry, materials science or medicine. Until now, studies have mainly focused on symmetrical 9,10&#8208;disubstituted anthracenes bearing (hetero)aryl groups or substituted alkyne motifs. In this work, we investigated unsymmetrical anthracene molecules to explore their propensity to trap and to release singlet oxygen. Kinetic studies confirmed the impact of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents on the photooxygenation step and on the release of singlet oxygen triggered by thermolysis of the endoperoxides.

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones were prepared. Their facile synthesis relies on arylboronic acids for boron incorporation, enabling significant structural diversity, dual&#8208;state emission, and reversible electrochemical reductions. Donor&#8208;acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300&#8197;nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.

Donor-acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole-functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation-induced emission enhancement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye-dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &amp;gt;300&#8197;nm &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Molecules containing ether skeletons are widely present in drugs, natural products, functional materials, and life science. Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H bond ether functionalization is considered a powerful strategy for the construction of novel ether derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign method was developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones from dicarbonyl compounds, bio&#8208;renewable glyoxal, and amines. More than 25 new 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;one compounds were synthesized in good to high yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
Described herein is an effective and green reaction between diketones, amines and bio&#8208;renewable glyoxal, affording a wide range of 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and releasing water as the only byproduct. The reaction features step&#8208;economy, high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, hazardous waste avoiding and easy scale&#8208;up. The further transformation between the products and aldehydes can be potentially applied for fluorescent dye synthesis.

         <title>Direct ortho&#8208;Selective Amination of Naphthols with Nitroarenes through Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols from nitroarenes has been developed for the first time using alcohols or ethers as a hydrogen donor.







Abstract
Hydrogen atom transfer from commonly used solvents to nitroarenes occurred. Such solvents required C(sp3)H&#8208;C(sp3)H bond adjacent to oxygen atoms, such as 1,4&#8208;dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, alkanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol and bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl) ether. The transformation was transition&#8208;metal free and the reduced nitroarenes were trapped by naphthols and their analogues at ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provided a favourable and efficient route to access ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols and a possible mechanism is depicted.

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached in a NaNO2/HFIP reaction system.







Abstract
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields (28&#8211;98&#8201;%). These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8211;19&#8201;%).

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X-ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Preparative Application of Amine Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions with Integrated Crystallization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ product crystallization (ISPC) was used to semicontinuously remove chiral amines from amine transaminase catalyzed reactions. The use of a constant mild vacuum facilitated the synthesis of six compounds in this way in a preparative fashion at gram scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%. The process included intermittent removal steps of the product salt and the replenishment of substrates every 24&#8197;h







Abstract
Transaminases are valuable catalysts in the synthesis of chiral amines. However, secondary techniques are typically required to shift the reaction equilibrium to the product side. This study focuses on the in&#8197;situ product crystallization, specifically at preparative synthetic scale as a non&#8208;synthetic tool for a selection of aromatic and aliphatic substrates using the transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi. Herein the technique is implemented in a simplified manner to facilitate in&#8197;situ product removal and downstream&#8208;processing in a combined crystallization step. After a series of optimizations, product concentrations of &gt;0.9&#8197;mol/L and &gt;99&#8201;% e.e. (S) were obtained implementing a repetitive batch reaction approach using a universal carboxylate as anion.

         <title>Synthesis of Methylenecyclobutenes by [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allene Ethers and Alkyne</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutenes are synthesized via thermal conditions between allene ethers and alkyne and successfully transformed to other four&#8208;membered ring compounds. This strategy provides a series of methylenecyclobutenes in moderate yields with broad functional groups.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutenes are useful precursors to provide other organic compounds. We report intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of allene ethers and alkynes at 100&#8201;&#176;C, which gives methylenecyclobutenes in 50&#8211;60&#8201;% yields. The reaction does not require any metal catalyst and shows broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn&#8217;t require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Short Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;Secoagroclavine via Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Csp3&#8722;Csp2 and Csp3&#8722;H bonds are formed on the same carbon atom by reacting the tosylhydrazone of chiral Uhle's ketone with 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid. This metal&#8208;free reductive coupling afforded an unexplored disconnection for the asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.







Abstract
A concise, convergent, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine, a pivotal intermediate in the synthesis of both clavine and ergot alkaloids, was accomplished from a derivative of the renowned Uhle's ketone. The synthesis is centered on metal&#8208;free reductive coupling of the tosylhydrazone derivative of protected 4&#8208;amino Uhle's ketone and commercially available 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid, which is used as a four&#8208;carbon building block. This novel approach directly sets the stereochemistry on the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access aryl vinyl methane carbon stereogenic center of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.

         <title>Synthesis of 5,9&#8208;Diaza Analogues of [5]&#8208; and [6]Helicene and their Chiroptic and Photophysical Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,9&#8208;Diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicenes were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryls. The [6]helicene could be resolved in its enantiomers. Photophysical properties of both compounds were determined by measurements and calculations.







Abstract
6,10&#8208;Dipropyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicene were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryldicarboxamides. Key steps in the synthesis of the teraryls are azide formation with subsequent reduction and amidation followed by Suzuki cross couplings. The ortho fusions were achieved with phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoryl oxide. The total syntheses could be accomplished with 10&#8201;% and 3&#8201;%, respectively, in seven consecutive steps starting with meta&#8208;dibromobenzene. The helicenes were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by quantum chemical calculation of, inter alia, the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Racemization barriers of the helicenes were calculated, whereupon the optical resolution of 5,9&#8208;diaza[6]helicene was attempted and carried out successfully; ECD spectra were measured of its enantiomers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroamide&#8208;Directed Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization Through Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization via intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations usually exhibit high efficiency, excellent selectivities and good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalization is an important strategy for the rapid synthesis of valuable organic molecules. Radical&#8208;involved remote C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization based on hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) becomes an important method enabling selective direct transformation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds at specific distal position(s). In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization through intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high selectivities and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

         <title>DMAPO/Boc2O&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot Direct N1&#8208;Acylation of Indazole with Carboxylic Acids: A Practical Synthesis of N1&#8208;Functionalized Alkyl Indazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

         <title>Rational Design of Metallylenes for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theory&#8211;driven design! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical analyses, we screened the hydrogenation capability of a range of diverse metallylene catalysts with varying Group 14 atoms and ligands. Our design features identify that stannylenes featuring a phosphorus&#8211;based ligand have the potential to activate dihydrogen and facilitate the hydrogenation of a spectrum of unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, and imines by H2&#8208;activated metallylenes (H3C&#8722;EH2&#8722;L, CELH2; E=Si, Ge, Sn and L=NMe2, PMe2) was studied using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BP86/TZ2P. By means of activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses, the physical factors underlying the trends in reactivity were identified and quantified. Firstly, the hydrogenation reactivity increases on descending Group 14, that is from silylenes (E=Si) to stannylenes (E=Sn). This reactivity trend originates primarily from a reduced energy required to break the bonds between the Group&#8197;14 atom and the hydrogen atoms because the strength of these bonds decreases from Si&#8722;H to Ge&#8722;H to Sn&#8722;H. Secondly, the reactivity decreases as the Group&#8197;15 ligand changes from nitrogen to phosphorus (L=NMe2, PMe2) which stems from the trigonal pyramidal PMe2 geometry compared to the trigonal planar NMe2 geometry. The latter can, therefore, effectively engage in stronger orbital interactions with the substrate than the former, due to a more efficient HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap. By combining our insights, we rationally designed an optimally tuned catalyst (Group&#8197;14 atom and ligand) considering the overall catalytic cycle involving H2 activation of the metallylene and subsequent hydrogenation.

         <title>Exploiting Hydroxamic Acids as Organocatalysts for the Epoxidation of Alkenes with Hydrogen Peroxide as the Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic epoxidation of alkenes synthesis is presented in which hydroxamic acids are used as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant. Mechanistic studies by direct infusion HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates.







Abstract
The epoxidation of alkenes has altered and reshaped the way scientists think in modern organic synthesis. Herein, a novel, sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol for the epoxidation of alkenes is reported, utilizing hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant and, for the first time, hydroxamic acid derivatives as the organocatalyst. The presented methodology is very effective, leading to good to high yields for the oxidation of a variety of olefins, while various functional groups are well tolerated. Mechanistic studies utilizing direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8208;HRMS) provide strong evidence for the mechanism of the organocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of furfural can be achieved by photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation of the aldehyde and coupling to electron&#8208;deficient olefins. With (Bu4N)4W10O32 as the photocatalyst, furfural can be added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to form the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.







Abstract
Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8722;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8722;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Chlorosulfenylation of Indoles by Dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2&#8208;Dichloroethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective metal&#8208;free method for vicinal Csp2&#8722;H difunctionalization of indole was reported. The common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE) were used as precursor to generate chlorodimethylsulfonium ion for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination by enabling 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.







Abstract
Direct chloromethylthiolation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of indole was achieved with the commonly used solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE). Initially, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of DMSO and DCE on simple heating at 120&#8201;&#176;C and is used for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination, enabling the synthesis of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green choice: Cyrene has been used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to environmentally harmful polar aprotic solvents in SNAr reactions. This innovative protocol enabled the facile synthesis of a wide library of novel nicotinic esters, valuable precursors of bioactive compounds. This methodology could also be extended to scale&#8208;up processes, microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis, and one&#8208;pot telescoping reactions, thus enhancing its applicability in various eco&#8208;friendly synthetic contexts.







Abstract
The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Tandem Oxidation&#8210;Organocatalyzed Aromatic C&#8210;S Bond Functionalization: Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzenesulfonamide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated a visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8210;organo catalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8210;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8210;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8210;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8210;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well. A radical mediated mechanism was proposed for the tandem oxidation&#8210;organocatalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
