      <title>Stereoselective Mannich reaction driven by crystallization</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we disclose an efficient and experimentally straightforward method for the stereoselective synthesis of a variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted Mannich salts. This direct three&#8208;component Mannich reaction operates on readily available reagents in almost stoichiometric ratio and enables the preparation of both enantiomers. Crystallization controlled epimerization allows isolation of the target compounds in high enantio&#8208; and diastereomeric purities by a simple filtration. The efficiency of this chromatography&#8208;free approach predestines it for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and industrial applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy for the Characterization of Asymmetric Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
  Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, the chiroptical version of IR spectroscopy, is introduced as powerful a tool for the characterization of conformational preferences of asymmetric catalysts, catalyst&#8208;reactant complexes, and activated species. Examples from ion&#8208;pairing catalysis, hydrogen&#8208;bonding organocatalysis, and enamine chemistry demonstrate that the computational analysis of VCD spectra can give deep insights into structural preferences of catalytically relevant species.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this Minireview, we summarize our recent efforts to use vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, the chiroptical version of IR spectroscopy, for the characterization of conformational preferences of asymmetric catalysts and complexes, formed upon the respective interactions or reactions of catalysts with substrates. After giving a brief overview of the general aspects of the technique, we showcase how VCD spectra of a chiral ion&#8208;pairing catalyst could be used to confirm a conformational shifting mechanism that determines the enantioselectivity of the catalyst. Chiral thioureas serve as examples for hydrogen bonding organocatalysts for which we demonstrate that both conformational preferences of the catalysts as well as of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes with substrates can be obtained from a detailed computational spectra analysis. J&#248;rgensen&#8211;Hayashi&#8208;type prolinol ether catalysts serve as examples to introduce experimental challenges associated with catalysts that operate by covalent activation of reactants.

      <title>Iso&#8208;maleimycin, a Constitutional Isomer of Maleimycin, from Streptomyces sp. QL37</title>
      <dc:description>
  Streptomyces sp. QL37 produces a previously undescribed constitutional isomer of the known antibiotic maleimycin, which received the name iso&#8208;maleimycin. Chemical synthesis was used to access reference samples of iso&#8208;maleimycin and maleimycin. GC&#8208;MS analysis and comparison with a bacterial isolate unambiguously revealed the presence of iso&#8208;maleimycin, but not maleimycin.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Iso&#8208;maleimycin, a previously unknown constitutional isomer of the antibiotic maleimycin, has been detected in an extract of Streptomyces sp. QL37. Chemical synthesis of both maleimycin (20&#8201;% yield over seven steps) and iso&#8208;maleimycin, (15&#8201;% yield over six steps) allowed access to reference materials for identification. Gas Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) analysis demonstrated that of the two isomers, only iso&#8208;maleimycin was present in the extract. This finding supports our hypothesis that iso&#8208;maleimycin is a biosynthetic intermediate of lugdunomycin. Iso&#8208;maleimycin displays low antibiotic activity, with a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value on both E. coli and B. subtilis of 250 &#181;g/mL.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>Novel application of polymer networks carrying tertiary amines as catalyst inside microflow reactors used for Knoevenagel reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A novel application is described for utilizing hydrogel dots as organocatalyst carriers inside microfluidic reactors. Tertiary amines were covalently immobilized in the hydrogel dots. Due to the diffusion of reactants within the swollen hydrogel dots, the accessible amount of catalysts inside a microfluidic reactor chamber can be increased compared to the accessible amount of surface&#8208;bound catalysts. To perform fast Knoevenagel reactions, important flow parameters had to be validated to optimize the reactor performance while keeping the dimensions of the reactor chamber constant; e. g. the height of the hydrogel dots had to be adjusted to the invariable dimensions of the reactor chamber, or an adjustment of organocatalysts in the hydrogel dots had to be validated to achieve the highest conversion rate during a certain residence time. To characterize the conversion, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopy were utilized as an offline and online method, respectively. With suitable hydrogel dots, the influence of different flow parameters (e.g., operating flow rate and reactant concentration) on the selected model reactions in the microfluidic reactor was investigated. Finally, a variety of reactants were screened with the optimized flow parameters. With these results, the turnover frequency was determined for the Knoevenagel reactions in a microfluidic reactor, and the results were compared with published data that were determined by other synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new one&#8208;pot method has been developed for the synthesis of highly substituted quinoline derivatives from &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives/glycine esters/ glycine amide and aromatic/aliphatic alkynes/alkenyl esters using molecular I  2  , K  2  CO  3  and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant combination in water at room temperature within 30&#8208;50 min. in moderate to good yields. This protocol has advantages like oxidant free, aqueous medium, simple operation, tolerance of various substrates and useful for the synthesis of bioactive azalignans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mild Deprotection of Dithioacetals by TMSCl/NaI Association in CH3CN</title>
      <dc:description>
  TMSCl associated with NaI was used to deprotect various dithioacetals in CH3CN with good to excellent yields. This metal&#8208;free process can also be applied with success for the regeneration of carbonyl of O,O&#8208;acetals, O,S&#8208;oxathianes, S,N&#8208;acetals, ketimines, and hydrazones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A mild process using a combination of TMSCl and NaI in acetonitrile is used to regenerate carbonyl compounds from a variety of dithiane and dithiolane derivatives. This easy to handle and inexpensive protocol is also efficient to deprotect oxygenated and mixed acetals as 1,3&#8208;dioxanes, 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;oxathianes quantitatively. As a possible extension of this method, it was also shown that nitrogenated substrates such as hydrazones, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and ketimines reacted well under these conditions to give the expected ketones in high yields. The methodology proposed herein is a good alternative to the existing methods since it does not use metals, oxidants, reducing agents, acidic or basic media, and keto&#8208;products were obtained in high to excellent yields.

  A series of ether (and thioether) substituted helicate&#8208;type complexes are presented which act as cation dependent molecular switches and in the cases of covalently linked systems show a counterion and length dependent &#8220;spring&#8221;&#8208;type expansion/compression behaviour.

Hierarchical helicates with ether or thioether substituents show in solution a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium which is independent of the heteroatom in the ester substituent. However, dimerization constants are significantly lower than for corresponding alkyl derivatives. Dinuclear helicates with oligoether spacers are well obtained in the presence of lithium cations. Upon removal of the cations the helicates expand and successive addition of LiCl results in compression again.

      <title>Successive Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Couplings for the Modular Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Di&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Thiophenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  A thiophene building block, with opposing bromide and ester&#8208;protected acid moieties, is utilized as a starting material for the efficient synthesis of an array of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophene through successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings, with an intermediate saponification step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Oligothiophenes are important organic molecules in a number of burgeoning industries as semi&#8208;conducting materials due to their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation and charge transport properties. Typically, non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophenes are prepared by the successive formation of Grignards, organotin, and/or boronic acid intermediates that can be subsequently employed in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. While reliable, these approaches present synthetic difficulties due to the reactivity of organo&#8208;metallic/pseudo&#8208;metallic species, and produce considerable amounts of waste due to necessary pre&#8208;functionalization. We have developed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling route as an effective strategy for the modular and less wasteful synthesis of a wide range of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;arylthiophenes. This method uses a thiophene ester building block for successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings that allows for the efficient synthesis and evaluation of the opto&#8208;electronic properties of a library of candidate semi&#8208;conductors with functional groups that could be challenging to access using previous routes.

      <dc:description>
  Fluoroalkyl(hetero)arylation of allylic alcohols with perfluoroalkyl iodide and difluoroacetic acid as coupling partners is reported herein. Mechanistic studies disclosed that the aryl migration proceeded through neophyl rearrangement in a radical pathway controlled by radical polarity. Moreover, promising antifungal activity against Magnaporthe grisea is also described for the first time.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Fluoroalkyl(hetero)arylation of allylic alcohols with perfluoroalkyl iodide or difluoroacetic acid as fluoroalkyl source was developed herein, delivering functionalized ketones containing an &#945;&#8208;quaternary center. Formation of the fluoroalkyl radical was followed by its intermolecular addition to alkenes and the migration of a (hetero)aryl group with the concomitant generation of a ketone group to finish the domino sequence. Mechanistic studies indicated that the aryl migration proceeded through neophyl rearrangement in a radical pathway. Moreover, preliminary antifungal evaluation against Magnaporthe grisea is also described for the first time.

      <title>Grafting Bis(heteroaryl) Motifs into Ring Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
  (N&#8208;isocyanimino)phosphorane has been utilized to synthesize bis(heteroaryl) motifs from a wide range of azoleamines and glyoxals in a variety of ring sizes, ranging from medium&#8208;sized rings to macrocycles. The macrocycles are synthesized in a facile manner from unfunctionalized linear histidine&#8208;terminated peptides and show a high degree of conformational rigidity over their homodetic counterparts. This method allows for rapid access to previously inaccessible bis(heteroaryl) scaffolds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Here we demonstrate an approach to graft bis(heteroaryl)&#8208;containing motifs into ring structures. The process occurs by redirecting a previously reported oxadiazole&#8208;forming reaction towards a pyrazole&#8208;forming process affording pyrazolyl&#8208;azole containing molecules. Through the use of (N&#8208;isocyanimino)phosphorane (Pinc), heteroatom&#8208;rich fused tricyclic heterocycles can be synthesized in a single step from readily accessible starting materials. The cyclization of peptides results in macrocycles that feature bis(heteroaryl) motifs with uncommon connectivity as compared to their natural counterparts.

      <title>Intramolecular Cyclization of Brominated Oxime Ether Promoted with Ytterbium(0) to the Synthesis of Cyclic Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A general, efficient, and experimentally simple one&#8208;pot new method for the synthesis of cyclic imines through intramolecular cyclization of brominated oxime ether promoted by ytterbium(0) was reported for the first time. In this new strategy for the construction of cyclic imines, the N&#8211;O bond is used as a receptor of ytterbium reagent rather than as a source of N&#8208;centred radical.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The first utility of ytterbium(0) as a mediating&#8208;metal in the intramolecular cyclization of brominated oxime ether was reported in this paper. In contrast to the prior methods, the N&#8211;O bond was used as a receptor of nucleophilic reagent, rather than as a source of N&#8208;centered radicals. Cyclic imines were obtained in this one&#8208;pot reaction with a broad scope of substrates and feasible reaction conditions.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

  A practical, versatile, and efficient method for the palladium catalyzed regioselective acylation of ketazines with toluene has been developed which provides a new approach for ortho&#8208;acylation of aryl ketones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A highly efficient and practical procedure for chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of ortho&#8208;diacylbenzenes through Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8211;H bond activation has been developed. Using this method, a variety of ortho&#8208;diacylbenzenes were prepared in moderate to good yields, by direct acylation of diazines with toluene derivatives as acylation source. Ortho&#8208;diacylbenzenes may be used as precursors in synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), a preferred synthetic procedure, generates by&#8208;products and effluents in multiples of equivalents for one equivalent of desired product. Presented here is the use of a fast and efficient coupling protocol for SPPS using a benzoisothiazolone (BIT), which can be fully recycled. The BIT, as redox activator, works under very mild conditions and generates very minimal waste. As a case study, the BIT coupling protocol is applied to the synthesis of side chain of recently discovered antibiotic, teixobactin.</dc:description>

      <title>Dehydrative Ring&#8208;Opening of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropyl Carbinols to Allylic Trifluoromethyl and Difluorohalomethyl Derivatives Promated by Titanium Tetrahalide</title>
      <dc:description>
  An effective approach to (E)&#8208;allylic CF3, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Cl, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Br derivatives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoromethylene, and polyfluorinated compounds has been developed, based on a titanium tetrahalide&#8208;promoted dehydrative ring&#8208;opening of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinols.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We report herein the titanium tetrahalide&#8208;promoted dehydrative ring&#8208;opening of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinols as a novel method for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;allylic CF3, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Cl, and (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Br compounds. This TiF4&#8208;promoted reaction appears to proceed via a concerted SN2' mechanism. A control experiment revealed that the TiCl4&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening initially proceeds by conversion of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinol into a gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl chloride intermediate.

      <title>ortho&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Hydrocarbons Assembled Using Olefin Metathesis</title>
      <dc:description>
  Macrocycles have been assembled from vinyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. The major products are trimers with congested, twisted structures. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations show that heterochiral configurations are favored. Photophysical properties are also discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  While many foldamer systems reliably fold into well&#8208;defined secondary structures, higher order structure remains a challenge. A simple strategy for the organization of folded subunits in space is to link them together within a macrocycle. Previous work has shown that o&#8208;phenylenes can be co&#8208;assembled with rod&#8208;shaped linkers into twisted macrocycles, showing an interesting synergy between folding and thermodynamically controlled macrocyclization. In these systems the foldamer units were largely decoupled from each other both conformationally and electronically. Here, we show that hydrocarbon macrocycles, with very short ethenylene linkers, can be assembled from o&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations shows that the products are approximately triangular trimer macrocycles with helical o&#8208;phenylene corners in a heterochiral configuration. Their photophysics are dominated by the 4,4'&#8208;diphenylstilbene moieties, the longest conjugated segments, with further conjugation broken by the twisting of the o&#8208;phenylenes.

      <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs): Synthesis of New Fluorinated Silanes and Diversity of their Synthetic Character</title>
      <dc:description>
  We present here the hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofloroolefins catalyzed by Pt, Pd, and Rh complexes as an efficient route toward a family of new polyfluorinated silanes as well as their use as versatile building blocks for subsequent functionalization based on C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  New polyfluorinated silanes were synthesized via the Pt, Rh and Pd catalyzed hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) in moderate to excellent yields. HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) and &#8211;1234ze (1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) were reactive with Pt catalyst to form tetrafluoropropylsilanes along with defluorosilylation products. The Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers of HFO&#8208;1336mzz (1,1,1,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobut&#8208;2&#8208;ene) gave the desired silanes with Pd catalysis in good to excellent yields, while with Pt catalyst only the dehydrofluorination product CF2=CHCH2CF3 (HFO&#8208;1345czf, 1,1,4,4,4&#8208;pentafluorobut&#8208;1&#8208;ene) was obtained. Synthetic applications of the new polyfluorinated silanes were illustrated by conversion of dichloro(hexafluorobutyl)(methyl)silane to the cyclic trisiloxane, which can serve as a monomer for the preparation of polysiloxanes. In addition, the hexafluorobutylsilanes showed defluorinative reactivity with lithium reagents, thereby demonstrating their synthetic utility as valuable building blocks for further transformations via C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.

      <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Thermal Isomerization of Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>
  Thermal isomerization of nitrile N&#8208;oxide (NO) provides isocyanate. However, the reaction mechanism for the isomerization has not been systematically evaluated. Herein, we report the concentration&#8208;dependent isomerization of NOs for the first time. The time&#8208;course plots indicate that the isomerization of NO would be driven by a very small amount of polymeric intermediate generated in situ in a substituent&#8208;dependent equilibrium.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Kinetically stabilized nitrile N&#8208;oxides (NOs) have been regarded as viable tools for the postpolymerization functionalization of common polymers. However, thermal isomerization of NO to isocyanate restricts the applications of NO to industrial use. The reaction mechanism for the thermal isomerization has not been systematically evaluated. Herein, we report the concentration&#8208;dependent isomerization of NOs for the first time. The time&#8208;course plots suggest that the isomerization of NO would be driven by a very small amount of polymeric intermediate generated in situ in a substituent&#8208;dependent equilibrium. The substituent effects of NO on the isomerization have been clarified with the kinetic parameters and the reaction order. It is indicated that an electron&#8208;donating para&#8208;substituent facilitates both the intermediate&#8208;forming reaction and the rearrangement reaction.

      <title>GABA Analogues and Related Mono&#8208;/Bifunctional Building Blocks Derived from the Fluorocyclobutane Scaffold</title>
      <dc:description>
  Two different approaches to fluorocyclobutane&#8208;containing GABA analogues and related building blocks were developed, which allowed for the multigram preparation of the title compounds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A series of GABA analogs and related mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks based on the monofluorinated 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane scaffold was designed and synthesized. The synthetic approaches included desilylative deoxyfluorination of TMS&#8208;protected cyanohydrin and iodofluorination of methylenecyclobutane carboxylate as the key steps. Both approaches were highly efficient for the multigram synthesis of &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids, monoprotected diamines, amino alcohols, and hydroxy acids. The first method was diastereoselective (dr 3:1) but it failed to produce the target products as pure, separable diastereomers. On the contrary, the second approach lacked diastereoselectivity but provided pure cis and trans isomers of the corresponding fluorocyclobutanes by separation of diastereomers; the products were obtained on up to 100 g scale in a single run. Moreover, the method was applied for the preparation of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that the synthesized building blocks are appropriate analogs of GABA with either somewhat larger or smaller size as compared to the parent amino acid.

      <title>Specific Optical Rotation and Absolute Configuration of Flexible Molecules Containing a 2&#8208;Methylbutyl Residue</title>
      <dc:description>
  The specific optical rotations of flexible molecules containing a 2&#8208;methylbutyl residue were calculated using density functional theory and correlated with their absolute configurations. The existence of a nitrogen atom could increase the uncertainty of the prediction and the geometry optimization step is more influential. To achieve unambiguous results, the calculation need be performed at more than one level of theory.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Establishing the absolute configuration of flexible molecules is difficult, and specific optical rotation (SOR) might be an optional strategy. However, complex conformation distributions inevitably generate ambiguous results. Herein, the relationship between SORs and the absolute configuration of flexible molecules containing a 2&#8208;methylbutyl residue was studied using quantum chemical calculations. The existence of a nitrogen atom might increase the uncertainty of the predicted SOR. Compared with the optical rotation calculation step, the geometry optimization step is more influential. Computational parameters including hybrid functionals, basis sets, and solvation models could exert a great effect on the Boltzmann distribution, leading to substantial variation in the SORs. To achieve unambiguous SOR prediction results for flexible molecules, the calculation needs to be performed using at least two combinations of different levels.

  Synthesis of new 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles bearing the 3&#8208;hydroxymethylated 4&#8208;hydroxyisoxazolidine moiety in a diastereoselective manner has been developed starting from readily available 4,5&#8208;unsubstituted 2,3&#8208;dihydroisoxazoles.

  A synthetic approach towards new 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles bearing the 3&#8208;hydroxymethylated 4&#8208;hydroxyisoxazolidine moiety has been described. The strategy has relied on dihydroxylation and epoxidation reactions of 4,5&#8208;unsubstituted 2,3&#8208;dihydroisoxazoles, allowing the introduction of the hydroxy group at the isoxazolidine ring in a trans stereoselective manner with respect to the substituent at C&#8208;3 carbon atom. The requisite 5&#8208;azidoisoxazolidines have been prepared from activated isoxazolidines possessing a good leaving group at C&#8208;5 carbon atom by treatment with trimethylsilyl azide and Lewis acid (isoxazolidinyl benzoates) or with sodium azide (chloroisoxazolidines). The 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety has been synthesized through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition.

      <title>Novel Preparation of Hemiaminal Derivatives with BPO and N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides and Their Synthetic Use for (Aminomethyl)indoles</title>
      <dc:description>
  Hemiaminal derivatives could be obtained in good yields by the reaction of BPO and N,N&#8208;dimethylamides under irradiation or warming condition. By using the hemiaminal derivatives, indoles bearing a (N&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;methylamino)methyl group could be smoothly obtained by the reduction of the indoles bearing a (N&#8208;acyl,N&#8208;methylamino)methyl group through the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction of indoles and the hemiaminal derivatives.

Further treatment of the obtained hemiaminal derivatives with indoles in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol generated the corresponding C&#8211;C bonded indoles bearing an amide group in good yields.

      <title>Exploring the Labile Nature of 2,4,6&#8208;Trimethoxyphenyl Moiety in Allylic Systems under Acidic Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
  A study aimed to comprehend the labile behavior of electron&#8208;rich aryl groups connected to allylic framework under acidic medium is carried out. Reveresible protonation and deprotonation at the ipso&#8208;carbon was found to be a driving factor in the C&#8211;C bond breaking reaction
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An investigation of the unexpected lability of the Csp&#179;&#8211;Csp&#178; bond connecting 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group and an allylic moiety is carried out. We observed that the catalytic presence of either Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid can render such 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group labile. Several nucleophiles were found to substitute the labile C&#8211;C bond in mild reaction conditions resulting in very good yields of the allylated products. Even in the absence of a nucleophile, intramolecular cyclization of the parent substrate under acidic activation caused the labile C&#8211;C bond to cleave. A major motivation of this study is to understand the lability of electron&#8208;rich aryl group in acidic medium, employing 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl moiety as a case study. A plausible mechanism is proposed after carrying out several control reactions as well as UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies. This work provides an insight into the activation of electron&#8208;rich arenes as a labile entity in acidic medium while also adding a conceptually novel C&#8211;C bond breaking approach to the vast literature of allylation of arenes.

      <title>A new mechanism for selective recognition of cyanide in organic and aqueous solution</title>
      <dc:description>
  We report that 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;(N&#8208;phenyl)benzamide is proposed as a simple colorimetric and fluorimetric chemosensor for selective determination of cyanide anion in organic and aqueous solutions via novel chemodosimeter approach named as nucleophilic aromatic substitution of hydrogen (NASH). Moreover, novel biological important benzisoxazole derivative has been synthesized with cyanide&#8208;induced ring closing mechanism.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A simple colorimetric and fluorimetric chemosensor 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;(N&#8208;phenyl)benzamide (DNBA), was synthesized for selective determination of cyanide anion in organic and aqueous solutions via novel chemodosimeter approach. The chemosensor DNBA showed a chromogenic and fluorogenic selective response to CN&#8211; against competing anions such as F&#8211;, AcO&#8211;, and H2PO4&#8211; in organic (DMSO and ACN) and in aqueous solutions (in DMSO/H2O: 8:2, v/v). The intensive colorimetric and fluorimetric color changes were observed in ambient light and UV&#8208;light (&#955;ex. 365 nm) after cyanide interacted with DNBA. A method that can be used in the synthesis of new biologically active benzisoxazole compound was described by the reaction of DNBA with TBACN and KCN in DMSO or DMSO/H2O, respectively. All interaction mechanisms between DNBA and cyanide and fluoride anions were demonstrated by experimental studies using various spectroscopic methods such as UV/Vis, fluorescence, 1H/13C NMR, and mass spectrometry as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction method. In addition, the experimental results were also explained with theoretical data. The spectroscopic results showed that cyanide interacts with three different mechanisms; deprotonation, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and formation of benzisoxazole ring.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cassane&#8208;Type Furanoditerpenoids: Total Synthesis of Sucutiniranes C and D</title>
      <dc:description>
  Intriguing reactivities were encountered en route to the first total synthesis of aromatic C ring vouacapanes featuring a substituted B ring (III and IV) through exploitation of the pivotal intermediate II. A new modification of the Caglioti reaction had to be developed to allow efficient reductive deoxygenation at low temperature.

  &lt;p&gt;Intriguing reactivities were encountered en route to the first total synthesis of aromatic &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; ring vouacapanes featuring a substituted &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; ring (&lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;IV&lt;/b&gt;) through exploitation of the pivotal intermediate &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;. A new modification of the Caglioti reaction had to be developed to allow efficient reductive deoxygenation at low temperature.

      <title>Arene vs. Alkene Substrates in Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: a DFT Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>
  Why olefin metathesis by Grubbs catalysts is not valid for aromatic arene substrates? DFT calculations, aromaticity indices, as well as the effects of non&#8208;covalent interactions between rings provide the solution.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  DFT calculations have been performed to compare metathesis of olefin, diene, and arene substrates catalyzed by a 2nd generation Ru(SIMes)&#8208;based complex. A large screening of modified substrates has been performed with the intention to explore the energetic gaps between acyclically conjugated alkenes and arenes in metathesis processes. The results are analyzed through the effects of conjugation vs. aromaticity, as quantified by the HOMA and NICS aromaticity indices, as well as the effects of non&#8208;covalent interactions between coplanar rings and/or any ring with functional groups nearby.

      <title>Deracemization and Stereoinversion of Alcohols Using Two Mutants of Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus</title>
      <dc:description>
  A one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step deracemization approach for alcohols that uses two mutants of Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus secondary alcohol dehydrogenase that exhibit different extents of stereoselectivity is reported. This approach is also used in stereoinversion of (R)&#8208;alcohols (i.e., Mitsunobu&#8208;like reaction).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We developed a one&#8208;pot sequential two&#8208;step deracemization approach to chiral alcohols using two mutants of Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (TeSADH). This approach relies on consecutive non&#8208;stereospecific oxidation of alcohols and stereoselective reduction of their prochiral ketones using two mutants of TeSADH with poor and good stereoselectivities, respectively. More specifically, W110G TeSADH enables a non&#8208;stereospecific oxidation of alcohol racemates to their corresponding prochiral ketones, followed by W110V TeSADH&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction of the resultant ketone intermediates to enantiopure (S)&#8208;configured alcohols in up to &gt; 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. A heat treatment after the oxidation step was required to avoid the interference of the marginally stereoselective W110G TeSADH in the reduction step; this heat treatment was eliminated by using sol&#8208;gel encapsulated W110G TeSADH in the oxidation step. Moreover, this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach was implemented in the stereoinversion of (R)&#8208;configured alcohols, and (S)&#8208;configured alcohols with up to &gt; 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess were obtained by this Mitsunobu&#8208;like stereoinversion reaction.

      <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Simple Aliphatic Ketones Using Ammonium Iodide and Hydrogen</title>
      <dc:description>
  On the direct asymmetric reductive amination of aliphatic ketones to primary amines: By using Ru&#8208;Binaphane as catalyst and NH4I as the amine source, it is possible to aminate prochiral aliphatic ketones with moderate ee values up to 74&#8201;%.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The direct conversion of ketones into chiral primary amines is a key transformation in chemistry. Here, we present a ruthenium catalyzed asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) of purely aliphatic ketones with good yields and moderate enantioselectivity: up to 99&#8201;% yield and 74&#8201;% ee. The strategy involves [Ru(PPh3)3H(CO)Cl] in combination with the ligand (S,S)&#8208;f&#8208;binaphane as the catalyst, NH4I as the amine source and H2 as the reductant. This is a straightforward and user&#8208;friendly process to access industrially relevant chiral aliphatic primary amines. Although the enantioselectivity with this approach is only moderate, to the extent of our knowledge, the maximum ee of 74&#8201;% achieved with this system is the highest reported till now apart from enzyme catalysis for the direct transformation of ketones into chiral aliphatic primary amines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the spring view of the rectorate building of Gazi University that was established in 1926 by Mustafa Kemal Atat&#252;rk. This building was designed by the famous Turkish architect Kemalletin and is one of the first educational institutions in the Republic of Turkey. The synthetic organic and chemosensor chemistry in this study was developed on this campus. Cyanide interacts with 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl)benzamide by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of hydrogen (NASH) and the colorimetric and fluorimetric changes were observed.

      <title>Interfering with the Sugar Code: Ten Years Later</title>
      <dc:description>
  With the aim of interfering with the information (sugar code) exchanged between glycans and their protein receptors, we have been developing carbohydrate mimics (glycomimetics) which are more efficient and more selective than naturally occurring saccharides. Here we outline our efforts over the past decade.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  This paper reviews the past ten years of our research in the field of glycomimetics synthesis and design. The structure&#8208;based design of mono&#8208; and polyvalent lectin ligands is one of the three main areas that we have explored in this period. We summarize here our work on ligands targeted against the dendritic cell receptor DC&#8208;SIGN. A second direction we have followed involves the discovery of lectin antagonists by screening of glycomimetic libraries. This approach has led to interesting hits against cholera toxin and related bacterial enterotoxins, as well as, in a different campaign, against the human C&#8208;type lectin dectin&#8208;2. Underlying both approaches, the development of robust synthetic methodologies for the rapid and selective synthesis of unnatural glycoconjugates has been our attempt to contribute to the diversification and enrichment of the chemical toolbox of glycoscience.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Direct Application of Sulfinate Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
  Sulfinate salts are versatile and convenient reagents to construct C&#8211;S, N&#8211;S, C&#8211;C and various other bonds. Herein we summarized recent progress in the synthesis of sulfinate salts as well as their direct application, focusing on both improvement of classical methods and new developments in last two decades.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Sulfinate salts have attracted considerable attentions due to their versatile reactivity. They have emerged as highly useful building blocks for the construction of all kinds of sulfonyl&#8208;group containing molecules, such as sulfones or sulfonamides, and for the construction of various carbon&#8211;carbon&#8208; and carbon&#8211;heteroatom&#8208;bonds via sulfur dioxide (SO2) extrusion. Herein, we want to summarize the latest developments in the synthesis of sulfinate salts. Both improvement of classical methods and the development of various novel protocols will be discussed. Also selected one&#8208;pot methods directly utilizing in situ generated sulfinate salts as intermediates will be covered in this review article.

      <title>Amide Bond Formation Strategies: Latest Advances on a Dateless Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
  The amide function is unarguably of primary importance, being the constituent of natural and synthetic polymers and found in a wide variety of bioactive molecules. This review will discuss specifically the very recent advances in the area of amide synthesis, specially focusing on metal&#8208;free strategies, based either on stoichiometric or on catalytic methods that were published in the last three years.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The synthesis of amides remains one of the most important transformations and it is one of the more frequently performed reactions. In the pharmaceutical industry, the formation of the amide group is pivotal and among the more important transformations in the design of the synthetic plan. This review presents an overview of only very recent contributions, published in the last three years, to highlight the latest progress in this &#8220;dateless&#8221; reaction, with a special focus on metal&#8208;free methodologies. New, more efficient and/or greener stoichiometric methods, as well as catalytic strategies, have been discussed, either for the &#8220;classic&#8221; coupling approach between an amine and a carboxylic acid (or its activated equivalent) or for more innovative approaches, mainly involving oxidation procedures to generate amides starting from amines.

  An asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones with vinylethylene carbonates in the presence of Pd2dba3&#183;CHCl3 and axially chiral phosphoramidite ligand was developed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones with vinylethylene carbonates (VECs) had been achieved in the presence of Pd2dba3&#183;CHCl3 and axially chiral phosphoramidite ligand. The reaction of various substituted VECs and 2&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones proceeded smoothly under mild conditions, giving the highly functionalized spirocyclic 1,3&#8208;indanedione derivatives in good to excellent yield with moderate diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity. The reaction on the gram scale had also been demonstrated.

      <title>Expedient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation towards Dibenzoxepinones: Pivotal Manske's Ketone for the Formal Synthesis of Cularine Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>
  We report on the intramolecular Pd&#8208;catalysed &#945;&#8208;arylation/cyclization sequence for the synthesis of dibenz[b,f]oxepin&#8208;10&#8208;ones from diaryl ethers. The substrate scope was investigated by varying substitution pattern on both aryl rings. The present work demonstrates the shortest route to Manske's ketone, a pivotal intermediate for the synthesis of four of the Cularine alkaloids.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The general synthesis of diversely substituted dibenzoxepinones by a combined Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation and SNAr strategy is reported and applied to the synthesis of Manske's ketone, a key intermediate en route to the total synthesis of cularine alkaloids. In the course of this work, an unanticipated ring contraction reaction to a xanthone was observed and serves as a caveat for the conditions of the widely used &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.

      <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Polymers: Energy Transfer to Various Polyaromatic Acceptors</title>
      <dc:description>
  Supramolecular polymers formed from phosphodiester&#8208;bridged phenanthrene trimers are doped with charged and uncharged acceptor chromophores. Excitation of the phenanthrenes is followed by efficient energy transfer to the acceptor molecules.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting antenna consisting of 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phosphodiester&#8208;linked phenanthrene trimers (donors) was doped with different charged and uncharged polyaromatic and heteroaromatic acceptor chromophores. Excitation of the phenanthrene moieties is followed by energy transfer to the acceptor molecules and radiative relaxation. The self&#8208;assembled fiber structure of the phenanthrene trimers is not altered by the dopant, as verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Among several neutral and cationic acceptor chromophores, benzo(a)pyrene emerged as one of the highest fluorescence quantum yields, reaching 31&#8201;% at a chromophore/phenanthrene ratio of 12 mol&#8208;%. The energy transfer is probably a combination of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and a coherent energy transfer mechanism.

      <title>Tuning the Chemoselectivity of Dehydroacetic Acid Derived Enones by Isoniazid and Phenylhydrazines: An Efficient Access to 3&#8208;Styryl Pyrano[2,3&#8208;c]pyrazolones</title>
      <dc:description>
  A nitrogen source&#8208;based chemoselectivity of dehydroacetic acid derived enones has been tuned by isoniazid, and phenylhydrazines, which resulted into various fused 3&#8208;styryl pyrano[2,3&#8208;c]pyrazolones and 3&#8208;pyrazolyl pyranones, respectively.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The first&#8208;time reported nitrogen source&#8208;based chemoselectivity of dehydroacetic acid (DHA)&#8208;derived enones has been tuned by isoniazid (INH), and phenylhydrazines respectively. When INH a first&#8208;line antitubercular drug, was employed as a new surrogate for nitrogen source, preferentially unconventional 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl addition occurred, providing a series of fused 3&#8208;styryl pyrano[2,3&#8208;c]pyrazolones in good yields. While in the presence of phenylhydrazines and molecular iodine, the reaction was proceeded via oxidative annulation across enone framework, resulting in the efficient and straightforward access to 3&#8208;pyrazolyl pyranones.

      <title>Regiodivergent Late&#8208;Stage Pd&#8208; or Ru&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Bond Functionalization Applied to the Straightforward Synthesis of N&#8208;Methylated Diflufenican Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
  When appropriate reaction conditions are employed, the regiodivergent Pd&#8208; and Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond functionalization of Diflufenican proceeds quite nicely. With a Pd&#8208;catalyst, Diflufenican was arylated at the C&#8211;H position which is flanked by two fluorine atoms; whereas, with a Ru&#8208;catalyst the arylation occurred at the less hindered ortho&#8208;position of the ether function of the trifluoromethylbenzene ring.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H diversification methodology was applied to the preparation of arylated Diflufenican derivatives. Using a palladium catalyst associated with potassium pivalate, a regioselective arylation of the C&#8211;H bond flanked by the two fluorine atoms was observed. The reaction tolerated a wide range of useful functional groups on the aryl bromide. Conversely, the use of a ruthenium catalyst allowed to arylate the trifluoromethylbenzene ring of Diflufenican. To the best of our knowledge, these synthetic schemes are the first ones allowing the preparation of such arylated Diflufenican derivatives.

      <title>One&#8208;Electron Reduction of Redox&#8208;Active Esters to Generate Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
  Radical decarboxylative functionalization of redox&#8208;active esters induced by one&#8208;electron reductions (OER) has recently become a research focus in synthetic chemistry. Here we present the new advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The one&#8208;electron reduction (OER) can profoundly affect the structure and reactivity of organic compounds. OER induced radical decarboxylative functionalizations of redox&#8208;active esters have gained wide concerns in this century. In this review, we present recent advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.

     alt="One&#8208;Electron Reduction of Redox&#8208;Active Esters to Generate Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Radical decarboxylative functionalization of redox&#8208;active esters induced by one&#8208;electron reductions (OER) has recently become a research focus in synthetic chemistry. Here we present the new advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The one&#8208;electron reduction (OER) can profoundly affect the structure and reactivity of organic compounds. OER induced radical decarboxylative functionalizations of redox&#8208;active esters have gained wide concerns in this century. In this review, we present recent advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

  Regiospecifically trideuterated (2,6,6&#8208;2H3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;terpinene was prepared in six steps and with a deuterium incorporation of &gt;99&#8201;% in 24&#8201;% yield from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedione monoethylene ketal. The synthetic procedure involved twofold cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkylcuprates (lithium dimethylcuprate and chloromagnesium cyano(isopropyl)cuprate, respectively) with enol triflates to introduce the alkyl substituents on the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene backbone. By changing the alkylcuprates, the synthetic approach could serve as a prototype for the synthesis of various 1,4&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives, which could be deuterium&#8208;labeled as well, for example for mechanistic studies.

      <title>Mechanism and Regioselectivity of Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Ene&#8211;Ketenes: A DFT Study</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8211;ketenes gives either fused&#8208;ring (via normal [2+2] cycloaddition) or bridged&#8208;ring (via cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition) cyclobutanones. For example, terminal ene&#8211;ketenes give the fused&#8208;ring cycloadducts, whereas dimethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes furnish bridged&#8208;ring cycloadducts. For monomethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes, both [2+2] cycloadducts are generated. However, there are no systematic theoretical studies on such a regiochemistry in the literature. Here we report our DFT study on the mechanism and regioselectivity of these intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions. DFT calculations reveal that both normal and cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloadditions are concerted processes. The normal [2+2] cycloaddition transition state is forming an internal carbocation while the cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition transition state is generating an external carbocation (see  Scheme 1  of the paper). On the basis of the relative stability of these carbocations, which is affected by both the tether and the substituent(s) on the alkene, a regiochemistry prediction model is proposed to understand and predict the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

  CF3O, CF3S, and CF3Se chemistries have been widely described in the last years. Tellurium is the following chalcogen but the CF3Te chemistry remains poorly described. This review presents the different strategies and methods currently available.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Fluorinated substituents confer specific properties to molecules. In the last years, the merging of chalcogenes with trifluoromethyl or fluoroalkyl moieties has known a growing interest.

     alt="Chemoselective Bromination of Dienoates"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One isomer or another! Chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity of dienoates bromination depends strongly on the substituent nature in starting ester and reaction conditions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A variety of tetra&#8208;, di&#8208; and monobromo derivatives of dienoates were prepared from parent polyunsaturated esters under mild conditions. According to proposed protocol the target bromoesters were easily obtained as a rule in good yields and high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
  Three&#8208;component one pot assembly of 4&#8208;fluoropyrazoles is described. The method involves formal oxidative [3+2]&#8208;annulation between elusive fluoroalkynes and azomethine imines.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A new approach for the synthesis of highly pharmaceutically relevant 4&#8208;fluoropyrazoles via oxidative annulation of &#945;&#8208;fluoronitroalkenes with in situ prepared hydrazones was developed. The reaction is efficiently promoted by trifluoroacetic acid while atmospheric oxygen was used as an oxidant. Broad substrate scope was demonstrated, using both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient nitroalkenes as well as different hydrazones derived from aromatic aldehydes. The mechanistic details were also outlined.

      <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Quinolines via a Scalable Tandem Photoisomerization&#8208;Cyclization Process</title>
      <dc:description>A continuous photochemical process is presented that renders a series of quinoline products via an alkene isomerization and cyclocondensation cascade. It is demonstrated that a high&#8208;power LED lamp generates the desired targets with higher productivity and efficiency than a medium&#8208;pressure Hg&#8208;lamp. The scope of this tandem process is established and allows for the generation of various substituted quinolines in high yields and with throughputs of greater than one gram per hour. Finally, this effective flow process is coupled with a telescoped hydrogenation reaction to render a series of tetrahydroquinolines including the antimalarial natural product galipinine.</dc:description>

It is demonstrated that a high&#8208;power LED lamp generates the desired targets with higher productivity and efficiency than a medium&#8208;pressure Hg&#8208;lamp. The scope of this tandem process is established and allows for the generation of various substituted quinolines in high yields and with throughputs of greater than one gram per hour. Finally, this effective flow process is coupled with a telescoped hydrogenation reaction to render a series of tetrahydroquinolines including the antimalarial natural product galipinine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Simple Strategy for the Preparation of P&#8208;Chirogenic Trost Ligands with Different Absolute Configurations</title>
      <dc:description>
  A simple, short and convenient route towards P&#8208;chirogenic Trost ligands obviates the use of chiral auxiliaries and enables the access to diphosphines with differently configured P&#8208;stereocenters.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  P&#8208;chirogenic compounds are useful ligands and organocatalysts in asymmetric synthesis. However, the lack of preparative methods and their configurational instability have significantly hampered their development. Herein, we report a simple strategy for the preparation of enantiomerically pure P,C&#8208;chirogenic diphosphines. Amidation of the borane adducts of rac&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acids with enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane afforded a 1:2:1 mixture of the diastereomers (C*,C*,Rp,Rp), (C*,C*,Rp,Sp), and (C*,C*,Sp,Sp), which were separated by column chromatography on silica gel. The prepared (C*,C*,Rp,Rp) and (C*,C*,Sp,Sp) stereoisomers were identical to those obtained from the enantiopure phosphines, which were synthesized by a multi&#8208;step route using chiral auxiliaries. Hence, this simple, short and convenient route towards P,C&#8208;chirogenic diphosphines obviates the use of chiral auxiliaries and enables the access to diphosphines with differently configured P&#8208;stereocenters.

  The asymmetric catalytic Mukaiyama Michael reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and silyl enol ether derived from a cyclic ketone was catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether to afford Michael products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

      <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Chlorophylls&#8208;a and Their Bio/Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>

The synthetic 20&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 32 ,32&#8208;difluoro&#8208;Chls&#8208;a showed similar optical properties and enzymatic hydrolysis of the phytyl ester as original (intact) Chl&#8208;a . By contrast, their 132 &#8208;stereochemical inversion (epimerization) occurred more rapidly, and the removal of their central magnesium (pheophytinization) was more tolerant than Chl&#8208;a due to the electronic effect of the fluorine atom(s) through the chlorin &#960;&#8208;system in a molecule. Since a fluorine atom is comparable in the size to a hydrogen atom, these chemically stable fluorinated Chls&#8208;a are promising as the synthetic alternatives to naturally occurring Chl&#8208;a , and are useful for the structural and functional investigation in oxygenic phototrophs.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Spirocyclic Pyrrolidine&#8208;Lactones by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>
  Enantiomerically pure spirocyclic pyrrolidines are prepared by highly diastereoselective dipolar cycloaddition using chiral aminolactones. Silver shows dual catalysis activating the dipole and the dipolarophile simultaneously. Final products incorporated a high functional group density, a new quaternary sterogenic center, and a spiranic unit connecting a pyrrolidine and a lactone.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The preparation of two enantiomerically enriched amino lactones as chiral starting substrates for asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions is described. They act as precursors of the chiral imino lactones, which form in situ the corresponding azomethine ylides. They react with electrophilic alkenes under silver catalysis to afford spirolactone&#8208;pyrrolidines products. The sequential method consisting in one&#8208;pot imine formation &#8594; cycloaddition is optimized and compared with the multicomponent process. The scope of the reaction is studied as well as the stereochemical outcomes and the mechanistic details using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

      <dc:description>
  The synthesis of biologically relevant C&#8208;ketoglycosides, found in many important natural products and medicinally active molecules is reported. This strategy allows to connect a series of glycal units to activated olefins via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative Heck cross&#8208;coupling reaction.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides is of great importance in the field of carbohydrate chemistry given its ubiquity in biologically active molecules. Herein, we describe a protocol for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative Heck reaction of activated olefins and 2&#8208;iodoglycals. A variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;ketoglycosides were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield using d&#8208;glucal, d&#8208;galactal, d&#8208;xylal, and l&#8208;arabinal derivatives.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

  The synthesis of versatile 5&#8208;amino functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, both in the forms of N&#8208;heterocycle fused and acyclic amino group functionalized forms, have been realized via the annulation reactions of gem&#8208;diamino enaminones and tosyl azide under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The annulation reactions between gem&#8208;diamino enaminones (ketene aminals) and tosyl azide providing N&#8208;heterocycle fused and 5&#8208;amino side chain functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have been developed. The synthesis of these N&#8208;side chain functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles has been executed with high efficiency and broad synthetic scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions with the assistance of NaHCO3 only.

      <dc:description>
  The oxidative spirocyclization of phenols and naphthols containing pendent amides is described that grants access to unusual spirooxazoline compounds. These rare spirocycles are prepared by an iodine(I)/(III) catalytic cycle.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Spirocyclic compounds are of increasing importance owing to their potential applications in the development of new pharmaceuticals. Herein, we describe a new, rapid access to rarely seen spirooxazolines utilizing an I(I)/I(III) reaction manifold. The scope of the cyclization using phenols and naphthols is described along with the stereoselective functionalization of the spirocycles. The application of this method to the formation of dihydrooxazines is also demonstrated.

  Almost five decades ago, the first proposals of computer programs meant to reproduce man's chemical knowledge in organic chemistry became known. They were products of what was then called Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, a section of computer science that takes on the controversial task of mechanizing human perception and thought; the human mind. This essay describes some of the key elements of this effort, pointing at specific features that involve the mind in creating and working with chemical software. A brief proposal of whether the neurochemistry in our mind works according to quantum mechanical laws, rather than logical laws, as in a binary computer, is given (Neural Quantum Superposition).

  &lt;p&gt;Almost five decades ago, the first proposals of computer programs meant to reproduce man's chemical knowledge in organic chemistry became known. They were products of what was then called &lt;i&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AI&lt;/i&gt;) research, a section of computer science that takes on the controversial task of mechanizing human perception and thought; the human mind. This essay describes some of the key elements of this effort, pointing at specific features that involve the mind in creating and working with chemical software. A brief proposal of whether the neurochemistry in our mind works according to quantum mechanical laws, rather than logical laws, as in a binary computer, is given (&lt;i&gt;Neural Quantum Superposition)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Tetrabenzoporphyrin Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based architectures have emerged as excellent candidates for artificial light&#8208;harvesting antennae. Although tetra&#173;benzo&#173;porphyrins (TBPs), the  &#960;  &#8208;extended &#8220;bigger brothers&#8221; of porphyrins, benefit from increased absorptivity in the near&#8208;infrared, their utilization in light&#8208;harvesting systems is still in its infancy. Within this work, we prepared two donor&#8208;acceptor hetero dyads consisting of hexa&#8208;  peri  &#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) to harvest high energetic near&#8208;UV light, and a TBP core, which serves as visible to near&#8208;IR light antenna and as subsequent energy sink of the conjugate. The HBCs are either attached to the  meso  &#8208;position or via a maleimide&#8208;bridge on the periphery of the macrocycle. Upon excitation of the HBC moieties, both dyads exhibit an efficient energy transfer to the TBP core. Furthermore, the TBP&#8208;HBC dyads show superior light&#8208;harvesting properties compared to the respective HBC&#8208;porphyrin reference and the naturally occurring chlorophylls a/b.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Imidazopyrimidines with diverse substitution patterns are a prime class of heterocycles, present in many commercially available or late&#8208;stage clinical trials drugs. Here, we describe a fast access to diaminoimidazopyrimidines by means of a powerful multicomponent reaction; the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; reaction. We provide the design of such libraries of compounds, identifying all the structural motifs, and subsequently their synthesis. Scope and limitations are discussed, in addition to data mining in the Cambridge Structural Database and pharmacophore search with Crossminer. The presented approach highlights the vast amount of data available in the databases and provides potential future scaffold hopping alternatives for compounds with similar binding patterns. Further studies are ongoing to introduce more &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties into this scaffold and to investigate cellular mechanism&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer behaviours.</dc:description>

      <title>&#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview summarizes the recent applications of halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding in organocatalysis. In all these cases, a Lewis&#8208;acidic region around an element of group 15&#8211;17 (the so&#8208;called &#963;&#8208;hole) interacts with the electron pair of a suitable Lewis base. Besides a discussion of recent applications, this review focuses on mechanistic investigations and comparisons between the different &#963;&#8208;hole interactions.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Noncovalent interactions like halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding are known for a very long time. During the last decade, these interactions have found different applications in catalysis. These forces are often called &#963;&#8208;hole interactions which can be explained by the anisotropic distribution of the electron density around these atoms. In this MiniReview, we will present recent applications of halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding in catalysis and discuss experimental and computational investigations to gain more insights into the underlying mechanisms.

      <title>Synthesis of seven membered oxacycles: Recent developments and new approaches</title>
      <dc:description>This review focuses on recent advances in the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered ring oxacycles, whether saturated, unsaturated, fused or isolated. We cover a remarkable variety of strategies and methods developed during the past two decades, based mainly on cyclizations, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, conjugate additions and ring expansions. The cyclizations can be generated directly or triggered through an oxocarbenium ion, carbocation or iminium&#8208;type species. Also discussed are ring&#8208;closing metatheses and conjugate additions, in which the precursor has the functionalities and correct stereochemistry of the final seven&#8208;membered ring oxacycle. Finally, examples of ring expansions are described, predominantly involving cyclopropanes and epoxides. These cases include reactions governed by the intermediate species and others where the precursor holds the stereochemical information for the final oxacycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles from Thioimidazoles and Ketones Mediated by Selectfluor</title>
      <dc:description>This paper presents a pratical and efficient strategy for the preparation of imidazol[2,1&#8208;b]&#8208;thiazoles from thioimidazoles and ketones mediated by Selectfluor. Regarding the mechanism, it was proposed that this transformation took place through electrophilic thiolation at an &#945;&#8208;carbon of ketones by sulfur cation, which is produced by the oxidation of thioimidazole by Selectfluor. This metal&#8208;free protocol tolerated various ketones, including methyl ketones or non&#8208;methyl ketones, aryl ketones or aliphatic ketones. The experimental results indicated that steric hindrance of the substituents at a&#8208;position of ketones or on the aromatic ring of aryl ketones had significant influence on the yields of imidazol[2,1&#8208;b]&#8208;thiazoles. Thioimidazole and benzothioimidazoles were well tolerated while 5&#8208;substituted benzothioimidazoles provided the mixture of the corresponding 6&#8208;substituted and 7&#8208;substituted benzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole products.</dc:description>

      <title>Cycloalkyl Groups as Subunits of Artificial Carbohydrate Receptors: Effect of Ring Size of the Cycloalkyl Unit on the Receptor Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
  Interesting structure&#8208;activity relationships were identified on the base of systematic binding studies with acyclic carbohydrate receptors. In particular, this study allowed the evaluation of the influence of the ring size of cycloalkyl units, which are able to participate in van der Waals interactions with the carbohydrate substrate, on the receptor efficiency.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  1,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted 2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzenes consisting of isopropyl groups as recognition units have previously been shown to have interesting binding properties towards selected carbohydrates. The design of such artificial carbohydrate receptors was inspired by the mode of action of carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins, namely by the participation of the isopropyl side chain of valine in the formation of van der Waals interactions with the carbohydrate substrate. This study aimed to investigate how the replacement of the isopropyl groups by other structural motifs, such as cycloalkyl groups of varying sizes (three to seven&#8208;membered rings), influences the binding properties of the acyclic compounds towards carbohydrates. The cyclopropyl moiety represents a cyclic analog of the isopropyl group, whereas the other cycloalkyl units can be regarded as structural elements, which differ from the structure of the isopropyl group by a &#8211;(CH2)n&#8208;bridge (n = 1&#8211;4) between the two methyl groups. Furthermore, according to the natural interactions, the cyclopentyl group should be able to participate in the formation of van der Waals contacts in a similar way as that observed for the pyrrolidine ring of proline in some protein&#8208;carbohydrate complexes. Such systematic binding studies allow the identification of interesting structure&#8208;activity relationships, which are very useful for the development of artificial carbohydrate receptors with predictable binding properties.

      <title>Construction of 6&#8208;Aminopyridazine Derivatives by the Reaction of Malononitrile with Dichloro&#8208;Substituted Diazadienes</title>
      <dc:description>
  The 4,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were used as starting materials in the reaction with malononitrile to open access to 6&#8208;aminopyridazine derivatives in up to 98&#8201;% yield. Further highly effective intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of ortho&#8208;halogen derivatives leads to a new type of condensed nitrogen heterocycles. The structural features of obtained compounds and their influence on photophysical properties have been studied in detail.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactions of 4,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with malononitrile resulted in an efficient approach to highly functionalized 6&#8208;aminopyridazine derivatives isolated in up to 98&#8201;%. The process was found to provide straightforward access to the interesting type of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with an exocyclic double bond. Furthermore, the possibility of subsequent functionalization of the obtained compounds via intramolecular cyclization was demonstrated. As a result, condensed azaheterocycles can be prepared very efficiently in one&#8208;pot and tandem versions. Finally, the influence of structural features of all synthesized compounds on their absorption characteristics in the UV/Vis&#8208;range is also investigated.

      <title>Functionalization of Bis&#8208;Diazaphospholene P&#8211;P Bonds with Diverse Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
  Diazaphospholene dimers readily react with aryl and alkyl halides to form carbon&#8211;phosphorus bonds without requiring catalysts, under mild conditions. Both polar and radical mechanisms are operative, depending on the substrate.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Phosphorus&#8208;sp3 or &#8208;sp2 carbon bonds are readily formed by the reaction of bis&#8208;diazaphospholenes with several classes of electrophiles. These reactions result in cleavage of the phosphorus&#8211;phosphorus bond and formation of functionalized diazaphospholenes. The reactions proceed rapidly, without catalysis. Experimental evidence with aryl and alkyl halides suggests the intermediacy of radicals in some cases, however other evidence suggests either radical or polar mechanisms may be operative for certain substrates, with a dependence on reaction conditions. In three cases, the product aryl diazaphospholenes have been shown to transfer the aryl substituent to electrophiles. These results reveal that diazaphospholene dimers are potent participants in radical chemistry with organic substrates at room temperature without requiring chemical initiators.

      <title>Oligomerization: An Inherent Property of Sulfonimidamides?</title>
      <dc:description>
  Deprotection of sulfonimidamides with formic acid in a long period of reaction time (hours to days) leads to the formation of the unexpected oligomeric sulfonimidamides. This work demonstrates that an unprotected sulfonimidamide can also undergo a similar oligomerization in a neutral solvent. The results show that oligomerization is an inherent property of sulfonimidamides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The treatment of the TBS&#8208;protected p&#8208;toluenesulfonimidamide with HCl exclusively affords the deprotected product. However, when HCl was replaced with formic acid, and the reaction mixture was left for an extended time or treated at high temperature, a mixture of oligomers was obtained as main products. The relevant N,N'&#8208;capped oligomers were prepared through carbamoylation with p&#8208;chlorophenyl isocyanate. The key to dicarbamoylation is to remove formic acid from the reaction mixture. For comparison, methylsulfonimidamide (as the representative of alkyl sulfonimidamides) was tested under similar conditions. Dissimilarly, the oligomerization occurred slowly, and the N,N'&#8208;dicarbamoylation is needed for an adequate separation of the oligomeric derivatives by HPLC. Oligomerization is an unexpected but inherent feature of sulfonimidamides, thus it is suggested that sulfonimidamides should be prepared in the HCl form or the TBS&#8208;protected derivatives to minimize the risk of formation of oligomers. Additionally, this work provides a simple approach to access oligomeric sulfonimidamides, an unexplored motif.

      <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Divergent Alkylation and Olefination of Methyl 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines with Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
  The controlled alkylation or olefination of methyl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines with alcohols has been developed through choice of ruthenium catalysts. The successful application of this methodology for a gram&#8208;scale reaction indicates its potential for bulk synthesis.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed divergent alkylation and olefination of methyl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines with alcohols have been developed. The selectivity can be rationally tuned by the judicious choice of ruthenium catalyst, wherein Ru(PPh3)3Cl2 delivers alkylated 1,3,5&#8208;triazines and RuCl3 gives olefinated 1,3,5&#8208;triazines in up to 98&#8201;% yield. Following this simple, facile, and high atom economical protocol, a broad range of products was prepared in moderate to good yields and tolerated heterocyclic or benzylic alcohols containing functionalities. The overall transformation operates through dehydrogenation of primary alcohols under the reaction conditions to provide the corresponding aldehydes, which further undergo condensation with methyl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines.

Following this simple, facile, and high atom economical protocol, a broad range of products was prepared in moderate to good yields and tolerated heterocyclic or benzylic alcohols containing functionalities. The overall transformation operates through dehydrogenation of primary alcohols under the reaction conditions to provide the corresponding aldehydes, which further undergo condensation with methyl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
  This Minireview gives an overview of the four important intermediates generated in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis that have been applied in the total synthesis of natural products: Breslow intermediates, homoenolates, enolates, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azoliums.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) efficiently catalyze new bond formations with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity through umpolung and non&#8208;umpolung processes. These processes typically involve four species: Breslow intermediates, homoenolates, enolates, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azoliums. Organic syntheses are increasingly relying on NHC catalysis, and this minireview highlights developments in NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that, over the past two decades, have been used as key steps in the total syntheses of natural products. Crucial intermediates and reaction mechanisms are presented in detail.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Arylation of the Indole Side Chain of Tryptophan Using Triarylbismuthines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A simple protocol for the regioselective N&#8208;arylation of the indole side chain of tryptophan using triarylbismuth reagents as the arylating agent is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper(II) acetate in the presence of an organic base. The protocol allows the installation of electron rich or poor aryl groups with substituents at any position, shows excellent scope and functional group compatibility, and retains the integrity of the stereogenic center.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A simple protocol for the regioselective N&#8208;arylation of the indole side chain of tryptophan using triarylbismuth reagents as the arylating agent is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper(II) acetate, and operates in the presence of triethylamine or pyridine under air at 50 &#176;C. This reaction allows the transfer of aryl groups bearing electron neutral, donating or withdrawing substituents at any position of the ring, shows high functional group tolerance, and retains the integrity of the stereogenic center. The protocol was utilized to N&#8208;arylate tryptophan&#8208;containing di&#8208; and tripeptides.

      <title>Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituted quinazoline push&#8208;pull chromophores: Synthesis, electrochemical, photophysical and second order nonlinear optical properties</title>

The influence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the pyrimidine core as well as the nature of the amino electron donating group has been studied by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Whereas 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)quinazoline and 2&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluorophenyl)quinazoline derivatives are highly luminescent in chloroform solution, 4&#8208;cyanoquinazolines are poorly emissive. Interestingly all compounds are luminescent in the solid state with the emission ranging from blue to red. The second order nonlinear optical properties were studied using electric field induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) method. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations corroborate the aforementioned experimental results.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible Reaction&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Dynamic Sensing and Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>
  Dynamic covalent bonding&#8208;based reversible probes provide real&#8208;time, accurate insight into the dynamic information of bio&#8208;species. Several strategies to design reversible reaction&#8208;based fluorescent probes have been discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Diverse chemical species such as ions and molecules exist within living cells and organisms undergoing dynamic changes in their local environment by a web of continuously interacting reactions.

This review summarizes the current methods for constructing reversible reaction&#8208;based fluorescent probes. The sensing mechanisms and biological applications of these probes are also discussed.

      <title>Regioselective Olefination of 3&#8208;Substituted Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Achieving site selectivity in the olefination of heteroarenes constitutes a highly attractive yet often challenging synthetic target. Herein we discuss the development of catalyst systems for the regioselective functionalization of 3&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered heteroarenes, which constitute particularly challenging substrates due to competing effects favoring different positions and are therefore attractive systems to prove strategies in catalyst design.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Five&#8208;membered heteroarenes constitute ubiquitous moieties in bioactive compounds and materials. It is thus not surprising that a direct and selective access to multiply substituted heteroarenes is considered as a highly attractive synthetic target. The direct olefination of such substrates, also known as cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has raised significant interest in this context. However, achieving site&#8208;selectivity remains challenging with some substitution patterns such as 3&#8208;substituted heteroarenes. Suitable catalyst systems and reaction conditions have to be identified, which enable the differentiation between the competing C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;position. Over the last few years, substantial progress has been made to overcome this selectivity challenge mainly based on the use of novel ligand systems, which will be described herein.

      <title>Time&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Bis&#8208;Spiro Cyclopropanes via Cascade 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Addition/Dearomatization Reaction of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 3&#8208;Chlorooxindoles</title>
      <dc:description>
  A simple method involving DBN&#8208;mediated spirocyclopropanation of para&#8208;quinone methides with 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles is reported, providing a novel class of bis&#8208;spiro compounds in short reaction times under mild conditions. Twenty&#8208;four examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 96&#8201;% yield.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A spirocyclopropanation of para&#8208;quinone methides with 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles that proceeds via cascade 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition/dearomatization reaction has been established, leading to a novel class of bis&#8208;spiro compounds in a concise, rapid, and practical manner. This transformation could be completed in high yields at room temperature within 5 min. The resulting bis&#8208;spiro cyclopropane derivatives are of great interest because of their potential biological activity and further reaction potential.

  &lt;p&gt;A simple method involving DBN&#8208;mediated spirocyclopropanation of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;quinone methides with 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles is reported, providing a novel class of bis&#8208;spiro compounds in short reaction times under mild conditions.

  &lt;p&gt;A spirocyclopropanation of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;quinone methides with 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles that proceeds via cascade 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition/dearomatization reaction has been established, leading to a novel class of bis&#8208;spiro compounds in a concise, rapid, and practical manner. This transformation could be completed in high yields at room temperature within 5 min. The resulting bis&#8208;spiro cyclopropane derivatives are of great interest because of their potential biological activity and further reaction potential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Molecules for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) &#8208;based molecules have shown an interesting behaviour within the field of perovskite solar cells, thanks to their promising application as electron transporting materials. In this paper, three novel NDI&#8208;containing molecules are synthesized and fully characterized, more specifically two polymers and an analogue small molecule. Each one of the NDI units contains an amine, either ternary or quaternary, which is a moiety known for improving the conductivity. The newly synthesized compounds are suitable for the use as n&#8208;type buffer layers on the top of PC 61  BM, thanks to their appropriate energy levels and their solubility in polar solvents. The photovoltaic performances of the NDI&#8208;containing cells are highly comparable to those of the reference cells, which contain bathocuproine (BCP) as buffer layer. Furthermore, the stability of the NDI&#8208;containing cells is higher than that of the BCP reference.</dc:description>

      <title>Can Heteroarenes/Arenes Be Hydrogenated Over Catalytic Pd/C Under Ambient Conditions?</title>
      <dc:description>
  Pd/C&#8208;mediated dearomatic hydrogenation under ambient conditions such as balloon pressure and room temperature can be a powerful tool for constructing alicyclic skeletons. Density functional theory calculations have been performed to confirm the mechanistic aspects and the utility of the established methodology has been demonstrated by donepezil synthesis.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Hydrogenation of over a dozen aromatic compounds, including both heteroarenes and arenes, over palladium on carbon (Pd/C, 1&#8211;100 mol%) with H2&#8208;balloon pressure at room temperature is reported. Analyses using pyridine as a model substrate revealed that acetic acid was the best solvent, as using only 1 mol% Pd/C provided piperidine quantitatively. Substrate scope analysis and density functional theory calculations indicated that reaction rates are highly dependent on frontier molecular orbital characteristics and the steric bulkiness of substituents. Moreover, the established method was used for the concise synthesis of the anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug donepezil (Aricept&#174;).

      <title>An Alternative Approach to the Hydrated Imidazoline Ring Expansion (HIRE) of Diarene&#8208;Fused [1.4]Oxazepines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A new approach to the synthesis of 10&#8208; and 11&#8208;membered lactams via hydrated imidazoline ring expansion is described. In addition to the ring expansion an alternative course of the hydrated imidazoline evolution was discovered, for the first time, which gave N&#8208;aminoethyl derivatives.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A four&#8208;step approach to the &#8220;hydrated imidazoline ring expansion&#8221; (HIRE) is presented. In most cases, the ring expansion was the sole process. However, for the first time, an alternative course of the hydrated imidazoline evolution was discovered which gave N&#8208;aminoethyl derivatives. These can, in principle, be converted into the target HIRE products under sufficiently forcing conditions. The approach offers improved flexibility with respect to the peripheral substituents and is also applicable to the synthesis of eleven&#8208;membered lactams. We observed that the latter can exist in two stable isomeric forms due to lactam&#8211;amide bond isomerization. The latter finding further demonstrates the value of medium&#8208;sized rings as multiple&#8208;conformer probes for biological target interrogation.

      <title>Application of Chiral Sulfinamides into Formation and Reduction of Sulfinylketimines to Obtain Valuable &#945;&#8208;Chiral Primary Amines</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview focuses on the use of sulfinamides as chiral auxiliaries in a condensation/reduction process to give access to &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amines. This paper gives an overview of all the methodologies developed around this process including metal hydride and transition metal reduction reactions, and of the application of these methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active chiral compounds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Chiral sulfinamides are very valuable, commercially available, and easy to handle chiral auxiliaries. One of the most interesting transformations that can be performed with a chiral sulfinamide is its condensation onto a ketone to form a chiral sulfinylketimine, followed by a reduction to obtain an &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amine. We review here all the methodologies developed around this condensation/reduction transformation. In the second part, we survey applications of these newly developed methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active compounds, including multikilogram scale synthesis.

      <dc:description>This investigation describes a one&#8208;pot reaction to prepare a series of building blocks for glycosylation reactions, such as 3&#8208;alcohol glucosamines, fully protected glucosamines,  O&#8208;  4 and  O&#8208;  6 alcohol glucosamines. These reactions readily produce not only glycosyl donors and acceptors, but also different glycosyl units that can be changed based on the needs of the experiment. The synthesis of some molecules containing glucosamines, including saccharide chains of glycopeptide (GP) and precursors of lipid A disaccharide backbone, are also described. GP has good selectivity for tumor angiogenesis and this phenomenon makes the GP a potential target drug. Lipid A has recently been adopted as an adjuvant for human vaccines.</dc:description>

Lipid A has recently been adopted as an adjuvant for human vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Detergent&#8208;Like Polymerizable Monomers: Synthesis, Physicochemical, and Biochemical Characterization</title>
      <dc:description>Three monomers with a maltose polar head, an alkyl hydrogenated chain, and an acrylamide&#8208;based polymerizable moiety were synthesized. The self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous solutions of these monomers were studied by means of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface tension (SFT) measurements, and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which indicated the formation of small micellar aggregates of about 6 nm diameter. The critical micellar concentration (CMC) was found to depend on the length of the alkyl chain and on the nature of the polymerizable moiety, ranging from 0.35 mM to ~10 mM. The monomers were found to solubilize phospholipid vesicles and to extract a broad range of proteins from  Escherichia coli  membranes. Finally, the extraction of two membrane proteins, namely, the full&#8208;length, wild&#8208;type human G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) adenosine receptor (A  2A  R) and the bacterial transporter AcrB was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterogeneous catalysts &#8220;on the move&#8221;: flow chemistry with fluid immobilised (bio&#8208;)catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>As both, continuous synthesis and (bio&#8208;)catalysis gained increasing interest in research as well as for industrial applications, ways for merging these fields enables novel opportunities for modern sustainable process development. In this contribution, an alternative approach for the application of immobilised enzymes in continuous flow processes is presented utilizing heterogeneous biocatalysts as a mobile phase. Based on superabsorber&#8208;entrapped enzymes and whole cells as a &#8220;fluid heterogeneous phase&#8221;, a segmented hydrogel/organic solvent system was developed. Its applicability was investigated with two entirely different model reaction systems, namely the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)&#8208;catalysed reduction of acetophenone, and the aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd)&#8208;catalysed dehydration of octanal oxime. In particular for solvent labile catalytic systems, this approach offers an alternative for the application of immobilised biocatalysts in a continuously running process beyond the &#8220;classic&#8221; packed bed and wall coated reactors.</dc:description>
