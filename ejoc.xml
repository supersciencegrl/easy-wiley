         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone, skipping the stepwise synthesis. The thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized &#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Strategy for C&#8722;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, recent advancement in the strategy for C&#8722;H functionalization of cubanes is summarized. There are two main categories: directed ortho&#8208;metalation and radical functionalization. Both classical stoichiometric conditions, which cover most of the literature precedents, and catalytic methodologies, which are expected to open a new aspect of cubane chemistry, are described.







Abstract
We summarized a strategy for C&#8722;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field. Cubane, known as a bioisostere of benzene ring, and its functionalization hold significant potential for future drug development. However, owing to its highly strained and thermodynamically unstable nature, the methodologies are limited and their precise and diverse functionalization is challenging in current organic chemistry. In this Concept, we categorized and explained these methodologies, which represents a majority of current cubane C&#8722;H functionalization. In addition, we discussed recent advancements in catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization methods, demonstrating their potential to address these challenges effectively.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of the Pyoverdine Chromophore: Expanding the Toolbox for the Preparation of Pyoverdine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic strategy for the chromophore core of pyoverdines is reported here, achieved by the coupling of two precursors efficiently prepared from cost&#8208;effective starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8211;DOPA respectively. This strategy was further employed in the first synthesis of the isolated chromophore of pyoverdine D.







Abstract
The pyoverdine chromophore is an important component of a family of siderophores which are secreted by the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa for iron absorption. In this study, an efficient and improved synthetic route to the chromophore structure is reported, beginning from readily available starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8211;DOPA. This strategy has not only delivered the first synthesis of the free pyoverdine D chromophore, but also offers potential access to a wide range of other pyoverdine chromophore species.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photocatalyst&#8208;free enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acids under mild conditions. This novel approach demonstrates excellent enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
In this study, we present an efficient radical approach for the enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) as a catalyst under mild conditions, without the need for metals, photocatalysts, and other additives. Prochiral &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals generated from RAEs were successfully introduced to N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives, including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline, resulting in a range of valuable chiral alkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes with secondary amines in high yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The chiral phosphoric acid catalyst not only activates the substrate and induces asymmetry but also facilitates essential electron transfer processes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first vinylogous allylic alkylation reaction using &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides as the &#947;&#8208;nucleophile is developed. This synthetic approach is mild and effective with a broad substrate scope to achieve the construction of multifunctional chiral 1,5&#8208;diene compounds.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric vinylogous allylic alkylation is an efficient method to construct chiral 1,5&#8208;diene compounds. In this work, acyclic unsaturated amides are used as a nucleophile for enantioselective vinylogous allylic alkylation. With 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral tertiary amine C11, the enantioselective vinylogous allylic alkylation between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazoleamides and Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates is achieved, affording optically active multifunctional chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (74&#8211;99&#8201;%) with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities (67&#8211;94&#8201;% ee).

With 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral tertiary amine &lt;b&gt;C11&lt;/b&gt;, the enantioselective vinylogous allylic alkylation between &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated pyrazoleamides and Morita-Baylis-Hillman carbonates is achieved, affording optically active multifunctional chiral 1,5-dienes in moderate-to-excellent yields (74&#8211;99&#8201;%) with good-to-excellent enantioselectivities (67&#8211;94&#8201;% ee).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodoaniline Dependent Formation of N&#8208;Aroylguanidines Versus 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolinones from Palladium(0) Catalysed Aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;Arylguanidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Arylguanidines upon Pd&#8208;catalysed aminocarbonylation reaction involving aryl iodide, in&#8208;situ generated CO afforded the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines exclusively or a mixture of two types of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones or one type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone depending upon the substitution pattern in the substrates. The formation of either type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone involves the C&#8722;N bond cleavage of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, a rare process witnessed in the guanidine chemistry.







Abstract
A family of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70&#8201;%&#8211;92&#8201;% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70&#8201;%&#8211;93&#8201;% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.

         <title>A New CuI/Oxalamide Catalytic System for the Large&#8208;Scale Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial example illustrates the remarkable catalytic oxidation capacity of oxalamide/CuI in the oxidative field and its prospective applications. It demonstrates mild oxidizing power at room temperature under air (Example 53), with excellent selectivity towards primary alcohols and completed 100&#8197;mmol scale&#8208;up. In addition, the structural modification of bioactive molecule derivatives and the derivatization of drug molecules have also been successfully achieved.







Abstract
Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8722;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100&#8197;mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes by Organophotoredox Catalytic Diastereoselective Anion Radical [2+2] Photocycloadditions of Arylenones under Batch and Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones promoted by Eosin Y under visible light. The reaction achieved high yields of bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes, with diastereoselectivity influenced by the reaction conditions. Additionally, DFT investigations were performed to clarify the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this study, the anion radical [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones was investigated under batch and flow conditions. The reaction was promoted by LiBr as a Lewis acid and catalyzed by Eosin Y under visible light irradiation. Symmetrical enones and asymmetrical unsaturated ketoesters were effectively cyclized to yield substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes in high yield and diastereoselectivity. Through the exploration of different experimental setups and reaction conditions, a precise control over the diastereoselectivity of the process was achieved, favoring the formation of either cis or trans substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes. In&#8208;flow experiments allowed to further improve the efficiency of the methodology, leading to higher productivity and space time yields. Furthermore, DFT investigations were conducted in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Electrochemical Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes with 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present an efficient organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities in the synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylated 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines.







Abstract
Acridine scaffolds are present in biological and pharmaceutical molecules. However, achieving asymmetric functionalization of acridines remains challenging without an efficient and highly stereoselective approach. Here we demonstrate a facile electrooxidative asymmetric dehydrogenative coupling reaction of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes. This method offers a sustainable and effective route to various chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylation of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities facilitated by readily available aminocatalyst. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetric analyses reveal that this asymmetric electrochemical reaction proceeds through redox&#8208;mediated oxidation, followed by a nucleophilic attack with concurrently generated enamine. We anticipate that our research will open avenues for promising exploration in organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective transformations.

         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles via organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;N bond oxidative coupling reaction. Structurally diverse oxindole frameworks were rapidly obtained in good yields in complex oxidative systems. In this research, the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products.







Abstract
An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87&#8201;% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Allylic Addition to Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative (deutero)hydroallylation of (hetero)arenes has been realized via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium, thus providing rapid access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. Based on a chiral auxiliary strategy, the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation reaction was also investigated.







Abstract
In comparison with the well&#8208;established allylic additions to C=O, C=N, and C=C double bonds, the dearomative allylic addition to arene &#960;&#8208;systems is heavily underdeveloped due to the severe challenge in breaking aromatic resonance stabilization. Herein, we disclose a general and efficient dearomative allylic addition to chromium&#8208;bound arenes using allylsilanes as the pronucleophiles, thus affording convenient access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. With commercially available deuterium sources, the versatility of this strategy further enables an arene dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuteroallylation with a high level of deuterium incorporation. Finally, a preliminary try on the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation based on a chiral auxiliary strategy is described.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Enolizable 5&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles</title>

Donor&#8208;Acceptor cyclopropanes undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with 5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles, producing the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts. At ambient temperature, the product of S&#8208;attack are most commonly obtained, whereas upon heating, the products of formal N&#8208;attack are observed. Test experiments demonstrated that the initial products of the studied reactions are formed via the S&#8208;attack exclusively. The product distribution is also dependent upon the cyclopropane's aromatic donor group.







Abstract
Diversely substituted dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (DACD) react under mild conditions, at ambient temperature in the presence of catalytic scandium triflate, with enolizable 5&#8208;meracaptotetrazoles. Most commonly, this yields the corresponding 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts via insertion of the S&#8208;atom into the strained C,C bond, leading to ring&#8208;opening. Control experiments performed with dimethyl 2&#8208;phenylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate and 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole demonstrated that the initial product of the reaction is the corresponding sulfane, formed via S&#8208;insertion. However, thermal rearrangement performed at 60&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of the isomeric N&#8208;insertion product. This rearrangement is accelerated by electron&#8208;donating substituents present at the para&#8211;position of the arene. In contrast, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents prevent this rearrangement at room temperature, and in these examples the S&#8208;insertion products were formed exclusively.

The synthetic protocol uses only KOtBu and DMSO to generate aryl radicals at room temperature. The reaction was explored with different substituents groups on the starting materials, demonstrating moderate to good products yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78&#8201;%.







Abstract
This paper explores an original synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds derived from photoinduced intramolecular coupling reactions, involving the formation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds. Specifically, two classes of compounds were targeted: 4H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaacephenanthrylenes. The synthetic strategy involved nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare key sulfonamide starting substrates, followed by photoinduced cyclization (via the Substitution Radical Nucleophilic Unimolecular, SRN1) under mild conditions using visible light. The scope of the reaction was explored with different substituent groups on the starting materials, which demonstrated moderate to very good product yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78&#8201;%. Moreover, this strategy represents the first synthetic approach to obtain 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaphenanthrylenes.

Specifically, two classes of compounds were targeted: 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5-amino-6-thia-4,5&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-diazaacephenanthrylenes. The synthetic strategy involved nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare key sulfonamide starting substrates, followed by photoinduced cyclization (via the Substitution Radical Nucleophilic Unimolecular, S&lt;sub&gt;RN&lt;/sub&gt;1) under mild conditions using visible light. The scope of the reaction was explored with different substituent groups on the starting materials, which demonstrated moderate to very good product yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78&#8201;%. Moreover, this strategy represents the first synthetic approach to obtain 5-amino-6-thia-4,5&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-diazaphenanthrylenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohols with TCCA was elucidated by kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. We found hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 as the determining step, while strongly electron withdrawing groups diverted the reaction course to hydrogen abstraction from the respective organic hypochlorite as a special case.







Abstract
A systematic mechanistic study employing rate constant (kobs) kinetics measurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA)/H2O in 50&#8201;% MeCN/CH2Cl2 at 25.0&#8201;&#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961;=&#8722;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2 and 4&#8208;NO2 substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in&#8197;situ from TCCA and HCl. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.

         <title>Furano&#8208; and Thieno&#8208;Fused Carbazole&#8208;Containing Azaborines and Their &#960;&#8208;Extension: Synthesis, Structures, and Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of carbazole&#8208;containing BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds fused with furans and thiophenes as well as their &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives were synthesized to provide a deep understanding of the structural effects of the fused ring moiety, the patterns of the ring fusion, and &#960;&#8208;extension, which finely tuned the molecular properties including the solid&#8208;state emission.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;containing azaborines, furano&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2F and 1&#8211;3F and thieno&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T, were efficiently synthesized from a common carbazole boronic acid ester in two steps. The structural effects of the fused ring moieties and the patterns of the ring fusion were clarified. According to X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, the furano&#8208; and thieno&#8208;fused carbazole azaborines had planar structures and generally formed 1D columns. UV&#8211;vis analysis revealed that their absorption properties were significantly affected by the fused ring moieties. In contrast, the fluorescence properties were affected by the ring fusion patterns. &#960;&#8208;Extended derivatives of 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T, benzothieno&#8208;fused 1&#8211;2BT and 1&#8211;3BT and phenyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8211;2T&#8208;Ph2 and 1&#8211;3T&#8208;Ph2 were synthesized, and the effects of &#960;&#8208;extension on physical properties were also investigated. All the &#960;&#8208;extended compounds showed red&#8208;shifts in absorption and fluorescence spectra compared with the pristine 1&#8211;2T and 1&#8211;3T. The color of solid&#8208;state emission of the synthesized azaborines was tuned from purple to green without electron&#8208;rich or &#8208;deficient substituents. The structural effects on the electronic structures were also discussed based on theoretical calculations.

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;Ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA), in which the adenine base (ethA) was fixed to syn conformation, were synthesized. The ethA:thymine base pair in the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick and parallel Hoogsteen duplexes could form two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds and two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds, respectively.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) were synthesized in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed in the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases through the syn conformation in DNA.

By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the &lt;sup&gt;eth&lt;/sup&gt;A:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because &lt;sup&gt;eth&lt;/sup&gt;A and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick-type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano-dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases through the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; conformation in DNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids with [Me4N][SeCF3]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with the nucleophilic [Me4N][SeCF3] salt was successfully accomplished by copper catalysis using air as an oxidant, furnishing the corresponding alkynyl trifluoromethyl selenoethers in good yields. Mechanistic studies revealed that the copper catalyst plays a key role in the oxidation of [Me4N][SeCF3] and the decarboxylation of alkynyl carboxylic acid for the subsequent trifluoromethylselenolation.







Abstract
The synthesis of alkynyl trifluoromethyl selenoethers from copper&#8208;mediated aerobic decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with [Me4N][SeCF3] is reported. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions and enabled the facile conversion of both aryl and alkyl alkynyl carboxylic acids to the corresponding trifluoromethyl selenoethers in good yields, demonstrating that decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with the nucleophilic [Me4N][SeCF3] reagent is feasible at ambient temperature without irradiation. Advantages of the method include the use of bench&#8208;stable and non&#8208;volatile alkynyl carboxylic acids as starting materials, readily accessible SeCF3 reagent, excellent functional group tolerance, and the avoidance of harsh reaction conditions. This copper&#8208;mediated reaction represents the first decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with a SeCF3 source.

         <dc:description>
Thioglycosides as glycosyl donors were activated by trifluoromethyl radicals, generated from trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722;) under visible light irradiation with Rose Bengal as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation using a p&#8208;tolyl thioglycoside donor in the presence of trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722;) has been investigated. This approach involves generating a trifluoromethyl radical via single electron transfer between TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722; and the photocatalyst Rose Bengal, thereby activating thioglycosides and facilitating glycosylation. This method operates under mild reaction conditions and tolerates a variety of functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Boron&#8211;Imidazole Complexes and Studies on their Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel fluorophore skeleton imidazo[1,2&#8208;c][1,3,2]diazaborole was developed. Three aryl groups substituted compounds exhibit fluorescence in the solution, solid state, and glass state. Their crystals have multi&#8208;stimuli responsive properties that exhibit mechano&#8208; and thermochromism.







Abstract
Organoboron complexes represented by BODIPY are one of the candidates for fluorescent skeletons exhibiting good fluorescence properties in the solution. However, because most BODIPY have high planar skeletons and small Stokes shifts, their fluorescence is quenched in the solid state. Therefore, numerous approaches were challenged to prepare the solid state fluorescent BODIPYs. On the other hand, an alternative approach to developing solid state fluorophores involves imidazole&#8208;boron complexes. Herein, imidazole&#8208;based boron complexes featuring the imidazo[1,2&#8208;c][1,3,2]diazaborole skeleton were synthesized. This skeleton comprised two fused five&#8208;membered rings and could introduce substituent at the 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions. The boron complexes with aryl groups at the 3,5,6&#8208;positions exhibited fluorescence in both the solution and solid states. These compounds exhibited Stokes shifts exceeding 120&#8197;nm, effectively suppressing self&#8208;absorption. DFT calculations suggested that the large Stokes shift could be attributed to the planarization of &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon excitation. In the solid state, the complexes displayed mechanofluorochromism, with the altered fluorescence color being recovered upon annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Compounds with two or three methoxy groups underwent a phase transition to a glass state, resulting in long&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Furthermore, they demonstrated mechanochromism, thermochromism, and thermofluorochromism in the solid state, indicating their potential as scaffolds for multifunctional fluorophores.

         <title>Synthesis of Hemiindigo Derivatives via a Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization Strategy</title>

Hemiindigos, important indigo derivatives, could be synthesized through the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates.







Abstract
We described a gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of Z&#8208;hemiindigo frameworks from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and in a gram&#8208;scale. Importantly, this method enables a simple and efficient synthesis of the special hemiindigo derivatives for the development of environmentally sensitive photoswitches in biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;We described a gold-catalyzed synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-hemiindigo frameworks from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-propynol phenyl azides &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and in a gram-scale. Importantly, this method enables a simple and efficient synthesis of the special hemiindigo derivatives for the development of environmentally sensitive photoswitches in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of privileged 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines has been developed utilizing readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketodithioesters as a two&#8208;atom (CS) synthon and 2&#8208;bromohydrazones as a four&#8208;atom (CCNN) unit in a cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization cascade. The method has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provides a direct route to functionalized 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines not easily prepared by other methods.







Abstract
Privileged 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines were synthesized from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketodithioesters as a two&#8208;atom (CS) synthon and 2&#8208;bromohydrazones as a four&#8208;atom (CCNN) unit through a cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization cascade. The operationally simple metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free method shows broad substrate scope as well as high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provides a direct route to functionalized 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazines that are not easily prepared by other methods. This one&#8208;pot approach features easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nontoxic reagents, high yields, gram scalability, excellent selectivity and the formation of an exocyclic double bond with Z&#8208;stereoselectivity.

Selective synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions for the first time in binary mixture of ionic liquids [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] [BmIL1] as an excellent task specific bifunctional catalyst.







Abstract
A binary mixture of organic salts, also known as ionic liquids, [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] denoted as BmIL1 has been explored as bifunctional catalyst for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions. The methodology has been extended to the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones via another pathway from different precursors under the same catalytic system. Greener synthesis of existing drugs reestablished the multifunctionality of BmIL1. Gram scale synthesis of both the products, DFT calculations and sc&#8208;XRD data add significance to the developed protocol. Moreover, high atom economy and eco score values justify the sustainability of the methodology.

         <title>Front Cover: Strategy for C&#8722;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 46/2024)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates two main methodologies of the C&#8722;H functionalization of cubanes: directed ortho&#8208;metalation (left) and radical functionalization (right). The design is inspired by &#8220;Chinchirorin&#8221;, a traditional Japanese dice game. In the picture, the dice (the cubanes) are rolled into a pot (a reaction flask). This illustration shows that hand throwing (a metaphor for a catalytic methodology) the cubane into a reaction pot enables precise C&#8722;H functionalization of cubane. More information can be found in the Concept by M. Hosaka, S. Nagasawa and Y. Iwabuchi (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202401055).

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Fluorenes: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched fluorene derivatives have long captivated chemists due to their potential applications in medicinal chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. However, the chiral separation of racemic fluorenes remains the primary method for obtaining these optically pure molecules. This mini&#8208;review summarizes and discusses fifteen years of developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes.







Abstract
The chiral fluorene fragment constitutes one of the most important scaffolds frequently found in numerous bioactive molecules, ligands, and advanced functional materials due to its unique physical properties. In this context, various transition metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions have been developed to prepare chiral fluorenes with high optical purity. In the present mini&#8208;review, we summarize fifteen years of achievements in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes and their derivatives. Particular attention is given to the strategies used and mechanistic aspects of some significant reactions. Moreover, the cutting&#8208;edge developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silafluorenes are also highlighted.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes and Other Unsaturated Systems: A Literature Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes and different &#960;&#8208;systems offers easy access to highly substituted arenes and heteroarenes. Nickel catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool for replacing expensive platinum group metals for cyclotrimerization reactions. This review summarizes the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni&#8208;phosphine, Ni&#8208;NHC, Ni&#8208;pincer, Ni&#8208;diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio-/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni-phosphine, Ni-NHC, Ni-pincer, Ni-diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined. Highly substituted arenes have broad applications in pharmaceuticals and soft materials. The applications of cyclotrimerization in these areas have been illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se Bond Formation via Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se bond formations via three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes. Decade developments were categorized into three types, which include (1) C&#8722;S/C&#8722;Se bond formations using radical strategies; (2) Reactions triggered by three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; (3) Reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed conditions and others. Mechanisms have been given for nearly all reactions.







Abstract
Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three&#8208;component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8722;S/S&#8722;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco&#8208;friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three&#8208;membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring&#8208;opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkoxyamines for Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 46, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieved by electrochemical, photoredox, and chemical oxidation methods. Utilized in small molecule synthesis. Investigated by computational studies.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry have begun to find their spot in a synthetic chemist's toolbox. Apart from their use of renewable reagents (light and electricity respectively), these methods have enabled pathways that were previously viewed as inaccessible. It is therefore essential to develop methods to further advance the fields of photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry. Alkoxyamines have been viewed as prime building blocks for photoredox and synthetic electrochemists because of their facile reactivity to oxidatively cleave C&#8722;O bonds. This review begins with addressing the first method developed for generating carbocations via a mesolytic cleavage pathway, and then highlights the recent approaches to utilizing photoredox and synthetic electrochemistry on oxidative cleavage of alkoxyamines for nucleophilic substitution reactions. To demonstrate its applicability, this review also highlights its utilization in the enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;calycanthidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;psychotriasine.

         <title>Strong Acid&#8208;Free Homogeneous Catalytic Systems for the Ester Products Synthesis by Alkenes Alkoxycarbonylation: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last 15&#8197;years publications on alkenes alkoxycarbonylation with alcohols and CO using homogeneous catalytic systems (based on Pd, Ru, Co, and Ni) in the absence of strong H&#8208;acids commonly used in these reactions were analyzed. As a result of these works, polyesters, monomers, and other valuable intermediates were obtained.







Abstract
Alkoxycarbonylation represents a method for the ester products synthesis from available reagents &#8211; unsaturated compounds, alcohols, and CO. The beginning of research on this reaction was laid in W. Reppe&#8217; works in 1953. In early works, halides and carbonyls of Co, Ni, Rh, and Ir were used as catalysts, and alkoxycarbonylation was often complicated by the unsaturated compounds hydroformylation or alcohol carbonylation. In recent decades, in the presence of the most active and selective Pd&#8208;phosphine systems with strong protonic acids, the products are typically only isomeric esters, which corresponds to the creating waste&#8208;free production principles. At present, a large&#8208;capacity synthesis process for methyl methacrylate, dubbed Alpha, is in operation, with the initial stage being ethylene methoxycarbonylation. In light of these developments, there is a growing interest among chemists and technologists in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation. The use of strong protonic acids as co&#8208;catalysts is essential for the formation of active catalytic complexes. However, these acids are highly corrosive and can cause the alkenes isomerisation. This review is devoted to the analysis of acid&#8208;free homogeneous Pd&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;catalysts employed in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation over the past 15&#8197;years. As a result, polymers, monomers and other valuable linear and branched esters were obtained.

         <title>From Enzyme Encapsulation to Environmental Solutions: Photostable Laccase in Dopc Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.







Abstract
Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post&#8208;irradiation compared to the free enzyme. In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, the simplicity and ease of large&#8208;scale production of multilamellar vesicles present an advantageous option for various applications, including bioremediation.

         <title>Magnetite: a Green, Sustainable and Recyclable Catalyst for Direct Synthesis of Thioesters by C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable approach to the direct synthesis of thioesters has been developed using Fe3O4 as a low&#8208;cost, easily prepared, reusable and environmentally safe catalyst. The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkylsulfonylation of 1&#8208;Acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;Cyanoindoles with Hantzsch Esters through Sulfur Dioxide Insertion</title>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoledione derivatives has been developed.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.

         <title>Rare Earth Metal Reagents in Organic Synthesis: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth elements, as an important part of the periodic table, not only represent a frontier area but also possess unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from those of main group elements and transition metals. Exploiting these unique characteristics to develop reaction systems not only holds profound academic value but also demonstrates extensive practical applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated organic synthesis has significantly advanced the field of synthetic chemistry over the decades. While transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions have become foundational, characterized by well&#8208;understood mechanisms like oxidative addition and reductive elimination, rare earth metals have not received as much attention. This review aims to highlight the synthetic applications of rare earth metals, fostering increased interest in their exploration. We discuss various reactions facilitated by these metals, including substitution, addition, insertion into unsaturated bonds, and coupling reactions, showcasing their unique capabilities and potential in modern synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;C3N4) as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst was developed for thiocyanation of alkenes under visible light irradiation with oxygen as green oxidant and without any other additives. The present protocol has excellent functional group tolerance and the desired tetrasubstituted alkenyl thiocyanides were obtained in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the recyclable mpg&#8208;C3N4 catalyst could be used at least 6&#8197;times without significant loss of activities.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted 7&#8208;Deazapurine Ribonucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides were synthesized to investigate their biological activities. The key&#8208;intermediate chloronucleosides were prepared by an anion&#8208;base glycosylation with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloro&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine. The target compounds were obtained by diazotation, either Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions in the case of 2&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;hetaryl nucleosides or two consecutive Suzuki reactions in the case of 2,6&#8208;diaryl nucleosides. The sequence of diazotation and the first Suzuki reaction is flexible and can be changed depending on the target compounds. Some of the final nucleosides showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines and low antagonistic activity against a panel of adenosine receptors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reported here is a photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type C&#8208;H amination of alkylarenes with nitriles. Under the irradiation of blue light and the catalysis of a simple Ce(III) salt, alkylarenes were brominated by CBr3COOH and thereby channeled to the normal Ritter pathway to afford amide products. A wide range of alkylarenes and nitriles were tolerated, with a few equivalents of a nitrile being feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8208;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A simple, efficient, metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly approach for the C3&#8208;H regioselective chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed by using diphenyl dichalcogenides and iodine as support in green solvent PEG&#8208;400 under ambient temperature and aerobic condition. Furthermore, chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone has also been accomplished in similar conditions. The proposed mechanism is based on the control experiments and suggests an ionic pathway. The reaction offers a green synthetic path with a high yield, and the methodology is crucially significant due to its operational simplicity, convenient execution, scalability, and tolerance of various functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.e. 90% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9:1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building blocks derived from tyrosine N&#8208;oxime have been used to construct natural products. We report the synthesis of nine halogenated tyrosine N&#8208;oxime derivatives reminiscent of biosynthetic precursors. Full conversion was ensured by the addition of p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TsOH) for monohalogenation and a key oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence using excess N&#8208;bromo, N&#8208;chloro, or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NBS, NCS, NIS) to provide dihalogenated derivatives.







Abstract
Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71&#8201;%, 50&#8211;53&#8201;%, and 78&#8211;80&#8201;% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8211;76&#8201;%, 54&#8211;56&#8201;%, 79&#8211;80&#8201;%). This strategy was extended to synthesize hetero&#8208;dihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8211;77&#8201;%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.

         <dc:description>Iodine(III)&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenated addition reaction have been realized. A series of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives bearing multiple functional groups were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies indicated that the reaction proceeds via a proton transfer followed by ring opening and ring formation to produce the target product. Moreover, preliminary biological evaluations revealed that both of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives show good antitumor activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Hydroxylation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids. This review summarizes the representative methods over the past decade. The paper categorizes these methods based on the types of catalysts employed, encompassing a range of metal catalysts and non&#8208;metal catalysts, as well as other reaction types of catalyst&#8208;free.







Abstract
Hydroxylated compounds represent a significant and diverse class of substances in the field of chemistry. These compounds play critical roles in various chemical reactions and are essential components in numerous industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds, especially those derived from boronic acids. The synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids typically involves the utilization of various types of catalysts, which are essential for enhancing reaction rates and selectivity, including metal catalysts such as CuFe&#8322;O&#8324;, Cu@C&#8323;N&#8324;, AgNPs, and Ti0.97Ni0.3O1.97, as well as non&#8208;metal catalysts like polycaprolactone (PCL), TFB&#8208;BMTH COF materials, C70, and graphene oxide (GO). These catalytic reactions often require the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) or molecular oxygen, which serve as critical reagents in the hydroxylation process. In certain cases, organic bases act as electron donors to propel the reaction. Furthermore, some studies have reported oxidative hydroxylation reactions that are catalyst&#8208;free.This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and breakthroughs in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids, with a particular focus on research conducted from 2014 to 2024.

         <title>A General Protocol for the Aqueous Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction between Cyclic Enones and 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general methodology for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction of cycloenones and a variety of di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds. The methodology involves the use of a bifunctional Lewis base as catalyst in aqueous medium at room temperature. The synthetic applicability of the polyfunctionalized MBH adducts is demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.







Abstract
In this report, we present an extensive methodological study of the aqueous Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of a range of cycloenones with di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto esters, 1,2&#8208;diketones, diethyl ketomalonate, ninhydrin, acenaphthenequinone, and phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, through mediation of a bicyclic imidazolyl alcohol (BIA) as catalyst in aqueous medium. The desired MBH adducts were obtained in up to 98&#8201;% yield. The synthetic applicability of the MBH adducts was demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, which facilitates many useful and challenging transformations, particularly in the formation of C&#8211;N bonds. In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been developed for the synthesis of allenes using propargyl electrophiles and various nucleophiles. However, the construction of allenes through reductive cross&#8208;coupling remains a challenging topic. This paper presents a strategy for synthesizing multisubstituted allenes through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The method employs propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to generate a range of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are mild, and the process exhibits high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, along with good substrate universality. Moreover, the method can be extended to chlorogermane and chlorostannane, leading to the formation of germanium or stannium substituted allenes. This study provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes and expands the synthetic toolbox for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Photoelectrochemical&#8208; Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Aldehydes to Acyl Radicals and Their Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactive nature. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes for the generation of acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss some of the key advancements in the past 6 years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their utilization. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Gem&#8208;Difluoroallylic Ketones Formation via Selective Carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) Bond Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;Ketone Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

         <title>S&#8208;Nucleophilic Imidazoline Ring Expansion: a Novel Approach to the Formation of Medium&#8208;Sized Thiolactames</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the formation of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles with a thioamide moiety has been developed. This is based on the expansion reaction of the imidazole ring under the action of an S&#8208;nucleophile.







Abstract
A novel method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles containing thioamide groups. This approach facilitates the expansion of the imidazoline moiety within the condensed ring system through the action of S&#8208;nucleophiles, enabling access to a broader and more diverse chemical space for natural product analogs and bioactive compounds. A series of [1,4,7]thia&#8208;(oxa&#8722;)diazecin&#8208;9&#8208;thiones were efficiently synthesized from diarene&#8208;fused [1.4]heteroazepines using this transformation, achieving yields ranging from 28&#8211;58&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concurrent installation of C&#8208;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8208;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8208;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8208;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.</dc:description>

Abstract
Bicyclic diaziridines are important heterocyclic scaffolds, which can be cleaved into 1,3&#8208;zwiterionic species to serve as a versatile precursor in fabricating biologically important N&#8208;hetero&#8208; and spiro&#8208;cyclic structural frameworks. Owing to their staple architecture, inherent ring strain and ease of synthesis, considerable advancements have been made by employing bicyclic diaziridines towards the construction of heterocyclic systems of biological importance. A significant surge with appreciable efforts in the adoption of such strategies has led to their implementation by the synthetic chemists. This article focuses on the developments in ring expansion of bicyclic diaziridines employed in N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. In fact, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a critical and comprehensive review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the synthesis of natural products through diverse synthetic routes employing (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt. Additionally, newly developed catalysts and synthetic protocols using (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol amongst their substrates scope are also analyzed and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl Aldehydes: Multifaceted Versatile Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioslective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactives heterocycles by using various C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;S and C&#8208;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new synthetic strategy for the construction of C2&#8208;quaternary indole for the formation of Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has been explored via indium(III) trifluoromethansulphonate catalyst at room temperature with TBHP as a green oxidant in water. This approach for the oxidative dearomatization process allows to produce natural product Halichrome A and a broad range of C2&#8208;arylated Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under a milder condition in very good yields. The oxidative self&#8208;dimerization and self&#8208;trimerization of various indole derivatives have also been achieved under the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Reductive N&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Carboxylic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent, achieving up to 90&#8201;% yield and broad functional group tolerance. It has been successfully applied to synthesize cariprazine, an antipsychotic drug, showcasing its potential in complex amine synthesis.







Abstract
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent. The direct amidation of esters with amines and t&#8208;BuMgCl generates the intermediate amides. Subsequently, without the need for isolation or purification, these intermediates reacted with Red&#8208;Al in the same reaction flask to generate amines up to 90&#8201;% yield. This process is characterized by the rapid reaction time, quantitative conversion, and broad ester scope with various functional groups. Notably, this method enables the successful transformation of amine with carboxylic esters to produce cariprazine, a pivotal antipsychotic drug substance.

         <title>DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Isoxazolone&#8208;Based Bisspiroheterocyclic Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines is reported, which provides an efficient access to spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazolone derivatives bearing CF3 group and quaternary carbon stereocenters in good to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A strategic approach to incorporate CF3 group into oxindoles, pyrrolidines, and isoxazolones to construct spiro heterocyclic skeletons with quaternary carbon stereocenters was developed. Using a DMAP catalyst under mild conditions, the controllable synthesis of spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazoline derivatives was achieved via concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines. This method exhibits robust regioselectivity and provides a series of isoxazolone&#8208;based bispiro heterocycles in good to high yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (in all cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), offering new candidate compounds for drug screen.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategic approach to incorporate CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group into oxindoles, pyrrolidines, and isoxazolones to construct spiro heterocyclic skeletons with quaternary carbon stereocenters was developed. Using a DMAP catalyst under mild conditions, the controllable synthesis of spiro oxindole-pyrrolidine-isoxazoline derivatives was achieved via concerted 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions of arylidene isoxazolones with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines. This method exhibits robust regioselectivity and provides a series of isoxazolone-based bispiro heterocycles in good to high yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (in all cases &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), offering new candidate compounds for drug screen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescence active ligand system consisting of a BODIPY derivative, linked to a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl coordinating moiety via alkyl or benzyl spacers, is presented. The designed ligands exhibit remarkable emission properties even in solid state, which is complemented by crystal structure analysis. This enables future application of the ligands in various fields of coordination chemistry including spin&#8208;crossover photoluminescence coupled systems.







Abstract
Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8211;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n=1&#8211;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions. Photophysical studies revealed high fluorescence quantum yields (69 &#8211; 95&#8201;%) in solution for the &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208; bridged ligand 3 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) and the &#8208;(CH2)3&#8208; bridged ligand 4 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene). Non&#8208;radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208; and/or &#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208; moiety for 2 and 1 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[4&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)phenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety and a spacer in meso&#8208;position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first total synthesis of a glycolipid, deinococcucin A, isolated from a gut bacterium, member of extremophilic Deinococcus family. The synthesis started from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, a sugar arising from chitin biomass, major constituent of crustacean's shell. The major difficulty was the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide moiety linked in alpha anomeric position of GlcNAc, which was efficiently obtained from the corresponding allyl group.







Abstract
Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>
Phenyl, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) fragments are assembled around a central porphyrin core and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve the merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing optical features.







Abstract
A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Preliminary In&#8208;Vitro Activity of 6&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl &#946;&#8208;Carboline Derivatives for the Development of Drug Conjugates Targeting MDM2</title>

The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. A series of MDM2 inhibitors based on a &#946;&#8208;carboline scaffold and containing a functionalized alkyl chain of variable length at the 6&#8208;position, was synthesized, docked in the active site of MDM2 protein and tested for antiproliferative activity towards U87MG glioblastoma cell line







Abstract
The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein, the main downregulator of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. However, the lack of selectivity and poor effectiveness in tumors bearing mutated&#8208;p53 impaired the approval of several MDM2 inhibitors for the market. In this context, the possibility of generating drug&#8208;conjugates within a MDM2 inhibitor is a growing research area aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Considering the promising MDM2 inhibition by the &#946;&#8208;carboline&#8208;based 1, in this work we explored the introduction of a new functionalization on it for a future conjugation while preserving its anticancer properties. Based on preliminary docking studies, we synthesized derivatives 2&#8201;a&#8211;d having linear hydroxyalkyl chains with different lengths at the 6&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;carboline core, which effectively preserved the submicromolar IC50 on wild&#8208;type&#8208;p53&#8208;U87MG glioblastoma cell line observed with 1. Candidates 2&#8201;a, d showed the functionalization was tolerated with respect of bioactivity also on mutated&#8208;p53&#8208;U138MG glioblastoma cell line, and their hydroxyl groups proved to be easily accessible when coupled to 4&#8208;pentynoic&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine affording derivatives 10&#8201;a, d with high yields. In summary, our results led to generating novel 6&#8208;hydroxyalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline compounds displaying a suitable hydroxyl&#8208;site useful to improve the efficacy and/or the tumor specificity of 1 through conjugation strategies.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dioxane as Precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;: A Simple and Convenient Strategy to Synthesize 1,2&#8208;Disulfide Substituted Ethanes Initiated by Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved via the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4&#8208;dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane generated in&#8208;situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented I2&#8208;initiated nucleophilic ring opening reaction of 1,4&#8208;dioxane with thiols for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes has been developed. Previously, dihalogenated ethane, acetylene or ethylene are often used as the pre&#8208;cursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;. Through the cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, 1,4&#8208;dioxane as precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved for the first time. In the presence of HI, thiols could be replaced by disulfides as nucleophile. This protocol is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides is explored in the formation of a C&#8211;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides. The products obtained were applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via Heck reaction as proof of concept, illustrating the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides.







Abstract
The unique reactivity and stability of enamides make them attractive reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we investigated the reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides in the formation of a C&#8722;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction using arylalkenyl boron&#8208;based reagents yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl enamides with an E configuration. The products obtained have been applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, an important scaffold in several biologically active compounds, via sequential Heck reaction to prove the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl enamides.

         <title>Immobilized Eosin Y on Modified Silica Nanoparticles and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized, functionalized with amino groups and covalently linked to Eosin Y (EY) through amide bonds. The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was characterized by microscospy and spectroscopy techniques. It displayed efficient photocatalytic activity in oxidation, reduction, and energy transfer reactions, demonstrating its potential as a heterogeneous photocatalyst with superior catalytic performance compared to its homogeneous counterpart.







Abstract
The development of novel photocatalytic systems is crucial for advancing sustainable chemical processes in organic synthesis. In this study, we report the preparation, characterization, and application of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on Eosin Y (EY) covalently immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including SEM, TEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and DLS. These analyses confirmed the successful immobilization of EY on SNPs and demonstrated the uniformity and favourable photophysical properties of the resulting hybrid material. The photocatalytic performance of SNPs&#8208;EY was evaluated in a series of model reactions, including aza&#8208;Henry reaction (cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling), reduction of nitrocompounds, and photooxidation of dimethylanthracene. The reaction results demonstrated that SNPs&#8208;EY is an effective and recyclable photocatalyst, offering yields comparable to or higher than those of homogeneous systems, while providing the advantages of easy separation and reuse. This study highlights the potential of SNPs&#8208;EY as a versatile photocatalyst for various organic transformations, promoting the advancement of green and sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Application of Laser&#8208;Generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) Furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid</title>

With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal&#8208;support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal&#8208;support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.

&lt;p&gt;With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum-based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser-generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal-support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the Au&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal-support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal-support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Chemoselective Enrichment of sp3 Character in Post&#8208;Ugi Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+3)&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Mercaptobenzimidazoles With &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Styrene Under Ultrasonic Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol developed (3+3)&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene under ultrasonic irradiation. The cyclized product was formed through the Michael addition and intramolecular substitution reaction successively. The pure products were obtained with simple recrystallization.







Abstract
A rapid and facile sonochemical route for the [3+3] annulation of 2&#8208;mercapto benzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene was reported for the synthesis of fluorinated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]thiazines. The reaction proceeds through the SN2/SNV pathway while the selective SN2 pathway is completely inhibited. The developed method is effective with a wide range of substrates, tolerating diverse functional groups. The pure products are obtained with high yield (up to 92&#8201;%) directly via recrystallization without column chromatography. Furthermore, applying sonochemical methodology reduces the reaction time and eliminates the need for expensive photocatalysts, ligands or oxidants.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Physical Properties of ExTTF Substituted with Aryl Groups through Sulfur Bridges and the Electron Transfers with C60</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four molecular tweezers with good electron donor ability were synthesized and fully characterized. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption studies showed that intermolecular electron transfer existed between compounds 1&#8211;4 and C60.







Abstract
ExTTF derivatives (1&#8211;4) bearing aryl groups attached through sulfur bridges have been synthesized. The peripheral aryl groups have a certain influence on both the electronic and crystallographic properties of the exTTFs. Compounds 1&#8211;4 show two bands typical of exTTF derivatives near 360 and 430&#8197;nm. Compound 1 and 4 exhibit the characteristic electrochemical exTTF behavior, with one reversible two&#8208;electron process ranging depending on their substitution the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability. But 2 and 3 exhibit a similar single two&#8208;electron oxidation wave but electrochemically irreversible redox with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak potential separation. And 3 has a low redox potential, which is significantly inconsistent with the electron absorption of pyridine substituents. The crystal structures of 1&#8211;4 exhibit the characteristic butterfly shape. Moreover, the peripheral aryl groups exhibit multiple alignment modes with respect to the central exTTF core, caused by their rotation about the two C&#8722;S bonds of the sulfur bridges. Under the interaction of multiple molecules, exTTF shows different molecular packing structures. Compounds 1&#8211;4 have charge transfer with C60 due to their good electron&#8208;donating ability, butterfly configuration, and free rotation of peripheral aryl groups. These results indicate that 1&#8211;4 organic electronic materials have potential applications in the field of supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Photochemical Reactions of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. This paper provides an overview of organic transformations achieved through metal and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts or even without the necessity of photocatalysts from 2019 to 2024.







Abstract
The adoption of clean and renewable light sources is becoming increasingly prevalent in organic synthesis due to their welfare, workability and economic benefits. In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. Since harmful or polluting reagents are not needed for the organic photochemical reactions, these reactions provide insights into sustainable processes and green chemistry. N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds (NHC's) constitute fundamental structural motifs in numerous organic compounds and are widely encountered in natural products and pharmaceuticals with diverse biological activities. Consequently, investigations into the synthesis and modification of these NHC's such as indole, carbazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline and pyridine hold particular significance for chemists and pharmacologists. This review provides an overview of the impact of photocatalysis on synthesis of NHC's and their modification from 2019 to 2024. These transformations are achieved through the utilization of both metal photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Ir, Pd, Co, Gd etc.) and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Eosin&#8208;Y, 4CzIPN, Mes&#8208;Acr+ClO4&#8722; etc.), or even without the necessity of photocatalysts. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers delving into the promising realm of photocatalyzed transformations.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8208;B bond in a range of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polystyrene into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent studies in the photooxidative degradation of polystyrene into benzoyl compounds. It includes a comparative analysis of various degradation methods, highlighting their effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, the review discusses the underlying mechanisms involved in the degradation process and addresses the challenges that remain in this field.







Abstract
Plastics play a crucial role in the survival and advancement of human civilization. However, the increasing challenge of plastic pollution presents significant obstacles. Disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling result in substantial resource wastage and pose potential environmental hazards. The slow progress in recycling and reusing waste plastics hinders their industrial application and effective response to environmental crises. Photocatalysis offers promising solutions for the future of plastic recycling, particularly with the recent increase in photocatalytic degradation methods for polystyrene (PS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the photooxidation of PS into high&#8208;value chemicals.

It is shown that the regioselectivity of the reaction can decrease in the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the tetrazole, as well as in the presence of protic acids.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we have reported a reaction that allows performing a Knoevenagel condensation, its adduct reduction, and subsequent decarboxylation in a single preparative step using cheap, stable, and convenient sodium hypophosphite. No metal catalyst is required. The reaction is scalable. The limitations of the method are also described in the paper.







Abstract
Saturated carbon chain elongation is a common refrain in numerous synthetic pathways. While the formation of C&#8722;C single bonds is of primary importance in organic synthesis, the simultaneous introduction of functional groups such as nitrile or ester can reasonably increase its practical utility for the preparation of multifunctional products. The Knoevenagel reaction is a powerful tool to create carbon backbones of organic molecules; however, it requires subsequent reduction and/or decarboxylation to achieve a product with a saturated carbon chain. Herein we report a convenient one&#8208;step protocol for the reductive condensation between methyl cyanoacetate and aldehydes in the presence of stable, ecologically benign, cheap and available in bulk amounts sodium hypophosphite as a reductant. A description of both the reaction capabilities and limitations is given in this paper.

         <title>Construction of Sulfur(IV)&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric (4+2) Dipolar Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) cyclization was disclosed, providing a modular platform for the synthesis of chiral sulfur(IV)&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.







Abstract
Chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds play an important role in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral pharmaceuticals, and chiral materials. While great progress has been made in the synthesis of these compounds, the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles remains relatively limited compared to acyclic ones. In this study, we successfully report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of structurally diverse chirality&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur(IV) six&#8208;membered heterocycles under mild conditions via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) dipolar cyclization. More importantly, these products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization: Selective Synthesis of Trifluoroethylated Benzopyran and Benzopyranone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction has been developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. This oxidant&#8208;free protocol offers several other advantages, including low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity.







Abstract
We have realized a photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be readily accomplished.

         <title>Homobarrelenones: Versatile Building Blocks for the Construction of Novel and Structurally Diverse Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through hydrogenation, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reduction leads to structurally complex and highly functionalized scaffolds. Results from preliminary sperm motility assays underscore the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.







Abstract
We describe the derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through simple transformations, including catalytic hydrogenations, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reductions. Despite being structurally complex and highly functionalized, the novel compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in sperm motility assays, underscoring the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.

         <title>Aryl Radicals Generated from Aryl Pinacol Boronates Modify Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl pinacol boronates generate aryl radicals under aqueous conditions. The formed aryl radicals can be used to functionalize peptide disulfides yielding&#160;S&#8208;arylated products, but they react readily with proteins as well competing with Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling used in bioorthogonal chemical biology applications. The overall reaction does not rely on metal, electro&#8208; or photocatalysis, and reflects the tunable Lewis acidity of organoboronates.







Abstract
We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages the versatile reactivity of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from the accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines has been developed on the basis of palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition. The synthetic approach features ready substrate availability, broad substrate scope, satisfactory yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition of propargylic carbonates with benzyl allenyl ethers has been developed for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines. The reaction proceeds by a pathway involving decarboxylative allenylpalladium formation, regioselective intermolecular insertion, and intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In this way, the sequential formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds results in the generation of a 2&#8208;benzoxepine skeleton in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime complexes catalyze highly diastereoselective radical cyclopropanation of olefins with &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates under mild conditions and low catalyst loading. A broad substrate scope including biologically active molecules is tolerated with high yields. This method is also amenable for gram&#8208;scale reactions, showcasing the application of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed metalloradical catalysis (MRC) in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>Xanthone Synthesis through Catalysis: Exploring the Green Limits of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advancements in the synthesis of xanthones, focusing on the transition from stoichiometric to catalytic methodologies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches. Key environmental metrics, solvent selection, and reaction steps, among others, are analysed, showcasing the potential of modern catalytic techniques to develop greener synthetic processes.







Abstract
The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in by&#8208;products and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Fischer Indole Synthesis: A Highly Efficient Construction of Complicated Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient scandium&#8208;catalytic reaction protocol for the classical Fischer indole synthesis, which can tolerate a wide variety of polycyclic substrates and allow us to easily construct complex indole structures in high yields for most cases. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the reaction efficacy, we also synthesized two quinazolinone&#8208;containing natural alkaloids, their analog, as well as an anticancer indenoindolone compound.

         <dc:description>
Using &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones and acetylenedicarboxylate as the respective reactive partners, the [5+1] and [5+2] cycloaddition reactions with isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates facilitate the construction of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazine and seven&#8208;membered N, S&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks under mild conditions. This cycloaddition approach exhibits exceptional substrate versatility and tolerance towards diverse functional groups.







Abstract
Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5+1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5+2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;Diarylation of Isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxylate by Double C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

         <title>Structurally Innovative Benzimidazole&#8208;fused Ionic Organoselenium Compounds: Prevalence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N/Se Chalcogen Bonds with the Selenocyanate Receptor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen Bond. Presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se chalcogen bonds are highlighted in the structurally innovative benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates, cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed the participation of both N and Se atoms of the SeCN counterions as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8211;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8211;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8211;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, surface electrostatic potential (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.







Abstract
An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Axially Diaryl Aldehydes by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Desymmetrization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Construction of Axially Chiral Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral carbonyl compounds are widespread in biologically active compounds and are useful chiral ligands or organocatalysts in asymmetric catalysis. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches have become powerful tools for constructing axially chiral carbonyl compounds, offering high efficiency, selectivity, and versatility. This concept aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carbonyl compounds. According to the reaction mode, the discussion is mainly divided into four categories: cross&#8208;coupling reactions, cycloaddition reactions, desymmetrization reactions, and other C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral carbonyl compounds are widespread in biologically active compounds and are useful chiral ligands or organocatalysts in asymmetric catalysis. Transition-metal-catalyzed approaches have become powerful tools for constructing axially chiral carbonyl compounds, offering high efficiency, selectivity, and versatility. This concept aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carbonyl compounds. According to the reaction mode, the discussion is mainly divided into four categories: cross-coupling reactions, cycloaddition reactions, desymmetrization reactions, and other C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;Oligomannurarates with Purported Anti&#8208;Alzheimer Activity</title>

Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides with purported anti&#8208;Alzheimer's activity, utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages.







Abstract
Sodium oligomannate, a sophisticated mixture of acidic linear &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;oligomannurarate ranging from dimers to decamers with an average molecular weight of 670&#8764;880&#8197;Da, has gained conditional approval for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8211;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.

         <title>Filling the Gap within 10&#8208;Membered Heteroenediynes: Thiaenediyne &#8211; An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiaenediyne, as a member of the heteroenediynes fused to a benzothiophene core, was synthesized using the S&#8208;type Nicholas cyclization. NBO analysis was used to demonstrate the primary role of the heteroatom in an enediyne core for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization.







Abstract
The heteroatom nature in 10&#8208;membered enediynes plays a crucial role in tuning of their reactivity in the Bergman cyclization, which is a decisive factor for the biological activity of enediynes. Although benzothiophene&#8208;fused O&#8208; and N&#8208;enediynes have been identified as promising biological objects, the corresponding thiaenediyne remains unknown. To fill this gap, we synthesized the thiaanalog and studied it in both practical and theoretical terms. While the Nicholas reaction has proven to be an effective cyclization technique for the preparation of heteroenediynes, in the case of thiaenediyne it was accompanied by an unusual acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization, forming a thiepinium salt. The S&#8208;enediyne has reduced reactivity in the Bergman cyclization relative to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;enediynes, attributed to the diminished alkyne bending and extended cd&#8208;distance. The NBO analysis of the entire series, namely the evaluation of &#960;in/out(C2&#8208;CC)&#8594;&#963;*(C&#8722;X) hyperconjugation, revealed that the S atom in S&#8208;enediyne provides stronger stabilization of the initial compound than the N atom in N&#8208;enediyne, while exhibiting the weakest stabilization of the Bergman cyclization transition state. NICS values were employed to examine the change in aromaticity along the Bergman cyclization coordinate. This approach, in conjunction with the NBO analysis, provides a foundation for further rational design of unnatural enediynes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

         <title>Tunable and Selective Transformation of Aromatic Thioether Enabled by Regulating Active Species Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the effective regulation of active species, the controllable upgrading transformations of aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions have been achieved by a pyridinium photocatalyst, which are ROS&#8208;dominated aerobic oxidation and the chlorine radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, revealing the great potential of pyridinium molecules in photocatalytic field.







Abstract
Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8901;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8722;S bond activation and cleavage.

         <title>Structural Modifications on Dopamine Molecules toward Polydopamine Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the structural modifications of dopamine in the organic chemistry level to enhance polydopamine (PDA) coatings. By altering the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, researchers aim to improve PDA's adhesive properties and expand its applicability across various surfaces. The study highlights the significance of these modifications in optimizing PDA for diverse applications.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic material synthesized through the oxidative self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. This material emulates the adhesive properties of mussel foot proteins, allowing the formation of robust and stable organic coatings on various surfaces. Researchers have attempted to identify and improve the surface&#8208;coating properties of PDA by incorporating additional organic functional groups. This review explores the structural modifications of dopamine molecules at the organic chemistry level, with a focus on changes in the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, and examines their impact on the applications of PDA. The flexibility of these modifications underscores their importance for optimizing PDA coatings for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent Thiazole Fused Benzo[a] Carbazoles by Sunlight Driven Photocyclization of Indolylthiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles has been reported for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles. The Key features of this method include the use of sun light as the source of energy, catalyst&#8208;free conditions and presence of medicinally important thiazole and carbazole moieties. Most of these synthesized products show very good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time a sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles, for the synthesis of highly fluorescent thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles using a mixture of solvents (CH3CN: DMSO; 3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Ring opening of indole moiety was observed in the case of thiazole derivatives having 2&#8208;methyl indole substituents. Under similar reaction conditions, photocyclization of trisubstituted thiazoles having cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls in place of indole moiety also worked. This reaction provides products having two medicinally important moieties thiazole and benzocarbazoles. We have studied the photophysical properties of all the products and found that most of the synthesized products have very good fluorescence quantum yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.

The reaction exhibits notable solvent effects in pyrazole's reactivity. The ionic liquid DBU&#8208;AcOH triggered the reactivity of 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;pyrazole, whereas the reaction in PEG proceeded selectively at the 3&#8208; &amp; 5&#8208;positions of pyrazole. Key applications of this method include the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamide, sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a copper-catalyzed, solvent-dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazolo-sulfonamides directly from nitro-pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]Thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. This review summarizes the developments in the construction of benzo[b]thiophene skeletons from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles by electrophilic and radical cyclization reactions.







Abstract
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
