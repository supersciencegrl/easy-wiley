         <title>Synthesis of Sulfur Enriched Cyclohexenes via the Tungsten&#8208;Promoted Dearomatization of a Phenyl Sulfone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for synthesizing sulfur&#8208;substituted cyclohexenes is reportedthat leverages the &#951;2&#8208;coordination of a phenyl sulfone to [WTp(NO)(PMe3)] (Tp = trispyrazolylborate). Three sequential protonation and nucleophilic additions to the bound arene, followed by oxidative decomplexation, affords functionalized cyclohexenes bearing sp3&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;enriched frameworks pertinent to drug discovery.

Prior work with the dearomatization agent [WTp(NO)(PMe3)] (Tp = trispyrazolylborate) has demonstrated the ability to synthesize cis, cis&#8722;3,4,6 trisubstituted cyclohexenes from phenyl sulfones. Herein, the compatibility of these methods with sulfur nucleophiles was investigated for the synthesis of sp3&#8208;enriched thioether&#8208; and thioacetate&#8208;functionalized cyclohexenes. Protonation of the WTp(NO)(PMe3)(&#951;2&#8208;PhSO2Me) complex followed by addition of a sulfur nucleophile was only successful for a thioacetate salt. However, when the first nucleophile was an ester enolate, subsequent protonation and nucleophilic addition successfully yielded a range of cyclohexene complexes with thioacetate, thiol, and sulfonyl substituents. Oxidative decomplexation of these complexes liberated the corresponding cyclohexene products. This strategy was then applied to the synthesis of a thioglycolate ester functionalized tetrahydrophenanthridinone.

Consecutive (Pseudo&#8208;)Four&#8208;Component Synthesis of Meta&#8208; and Ortho&#8208;Biaryl Triarylamines with Tunable Emission and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of Suzuki and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling in (pseudo&#8208;)four&#8208;component reactions paves an efficient one&#8208;pot route to twisted, redox&#8208;active triarylamine (TAA) emitters. Biaryl substitution patterns and para&#8208;substituents serve as key levers for tuning redox potentials, as well as absorption and emission energies, complemented and, by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, establish a solid framework of structure&#8211;property relationships for the rational design of finely tunable TAA.

The strategic combination of Suzuki coupling and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination in consecutive (pseudo&#8208;)four&#8208;component syntheses provides a highly efficient and modular route to meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (m&#8208; and o&#8208;bTAA), thereby expanding a substance library that has previously focused on para&#8208;bTAA. The broad range of novel bTAA enables comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties and reveals highly tunable emission in solution from blue to yellow, with quantum yields up to 55%, and up to 26% in the solid state. The bTAA also show strong potential as stimulus&#8208;responsive luminophores due to their pronounced positive emission solvatochromism, which indicates substantial charge transfer character&#8212;particularly in the m&#8208;bTAA&#8212;as well as aggregation&#8208;induced emission in DMSO/water mixtures with with intensity enhancements of up to 75&#8208;fold. Quantitative 2D Hammett correlations combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations systematically rationalize substituent effects not only on the emission properties but also on the low, reversible redox potentials determined by cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry further reveals irreversible dimerization processes in certain unsubstituted bTAA. In addition to para&#8208;substituents, the biaryl substitution pattern (meta, ortho, or para) also proves to be a finely tunable parameters, opening new opportunities for the rational design of tailored bTAA emitters with predictable structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Fenton's Reagent Mediated Radical Cascade Trideuteromethylation of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Oxime With DMSO&#8208;d6: Synthesis of Trideuteromethylated Isoxazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trideuteromethylated isoxazolines were efficiently synthesized via trideuteromethylation of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated oximes by employing Fenton's reagent system with DMSO&#8208;d6 as the &#8220;CD3&#8221; source. Mechanistically, it was postulated that the hydroxyl radical generated from Fenton's reagent system first reacted with DMSO&#8208;d6 to give the trideuteromethyl radical, which underwent radical substitution followed by cyclization with &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated oximes to give the title products.

         <title>Synthesis of the Pentasaccharide Repeating Unit Corresponding to the Cell Wall O&#8208;Polysaccharide of Salmonella riogrande O:40 (Group R) Strain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a pentasaccharide corresponding to the cell wall O&#8208;polysaccharide of Salmonella riogrande O:40 has been achieved in very good yield. During the synthesis, construction of the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine moiety was achieved by using 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine thioglycoside donor in ether&#8208;based reaction solvent. Construction of the &#946;&#8208;mannosidic linkage in the pentasaccharide was achieved using remotely placed picoloyl group influenced H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery.

All glycosylation steps were high yielding with satisfactory stereochemistry at the newly formed glycosidic linkages. Azido group was directly converted into acetamido group by the treatment with thioacetic acid and triethylsilane was used as the source of hydrogen in a catalytic transfer hydrogenation condition.

All glycosylation steps were high yielding with satisfactory stereochemistry at the newly formed glycosidic linkages.

         <title>TBAF&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion of Carbamates Into Unsymmetrical Ureas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, additive&#8208;free approach enables in&#8201;situ generation of isocyanates from N&#8208;alkyl/aryl O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with catalytic amount of TBAF at room temperature that react smoothly with amines to produce unsymmetrical ureas in moderate to excellent yields. This practical , ishort reaction time, operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, method led to gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a celiprolol intermediate.

This study investigates the synthesis of unsymmetrical ureas involving tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) catalyzed in&#8201;situ generation of isocyanate of N&#8208;alkyl/aryl O&#8208;phenyl carbamates at room temperature that subsequently reacts with alkyl/aromatic amines to yield unsymmetrical urea with moderate to excellent yields including gram scale synthesis of celiprolol intermediate. The process of employing TBAF an organocatalyst, thus, eliminates the use of hazardous reagents, hence making the process sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and additive free.

         <title>T&#8208;Shaped 8&#8208;Aryl(ethynyl)&#8208;Substituted Psoralens With Tunable Charge&#8208;Transfer Absorption</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 8&#8208;methoxypsoralen, new 8&#8208;arylated and 8&#8208;alkynylated psoralen derivatives are accessible by cross&#8208;coupling. These T&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;expanded chromophores are luminescent and photophysics reveal a highly polar excited state with tunable charge&#8208;transfer character.

Two series of novel T&#8208;shaped 8&#8208;substituted psoralen derivatives bearing (hetero)aryl and arylethynyl substituents were synthesized via Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling starting from 8&#8208;methoxypsoralen (8&#8208;MOP). Predominantly, electron&#8208;donating substituents such as anisyl and phenothiazine were introduced at the 8&#8208;position of the psoralen for increasing the electron density in comparison to 8&#8208;MOP. Photophysical properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state. Increasing the donor strength of the substituent causes a bathochromic shift of both absorption and emission maxima. The absorption behavior can be correlated with Hammett substituent parameters of remote substituents at the p&#8208;aryl moieties that are directly or by ethynyl spacing positioned at the 8&#8208;position of psoralen. In most cases, fluorescence in the solid state is more pronounced than in solution. One derivative also displays significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission. For two amino&#8208;substituted psoralen derivatives, positive emission solvatochromism was observed and associated with a considerable change of dipole moment upon photonic excitation according to Lippert&#8211;Mataga analysis. Furthermore, the pKa value of the T&#8208;shaped dimethylaminophenyl psoralen derivative was determined from absorption spectra. In addition, emission quenching is caused by protonation on the nitrogen atom. TD&#8208;DFT (time&#8208;dependent density functional theory) calculations are in good agreement with experimental data and rationalize the electronic structure.

         <title>Photochemical Amination of Thioethers Under Biphasic Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic reaction conditions for the iron&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of sulfilimines and sulfoximines in continuous flow using 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethyl&#8208;N&#8208;mesyloxycarbamate (TrocNHOMs).

A practical, continuous flow, biphasic photochemical amination of thioethers, employing N&#8208;mesyloxycarbamates as nitrene precursors, is reported. Using UVA irradiation at 365&#8201;nm and Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, the reaction efficiently converts aromatic and aliphatic thioethers into Troc&#8208;protected sulfilimines in high yields. The biphasic ethyl acetate/water system plays a critical role in preventing clogging of the reactor by dissolving the mesylate byproduct.

         <title>Telescopic Synthesis of Triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl Modified Phenylalanine Conjugates and Peptide Modification Using a Sonogashira Domino Strategy at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A telescopic one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;phenylalanine conjugates is reported. The method features the in&#8201;situ generation of terminal alkyne and organic azide. This approach provides milder conditions, enhanced step economy, preservation of chiral integrity, and enables post&#8208;synthesis peptide modification.

We report a telescopic two&#8208;step synthetic strategy for efficiently constructing [1H]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl modified phenylalanine conjugates. The method combines Sonogashira coupling and a one&#8208;pot domino reaction involving desilylation, azidation, and click chemistry. This protocol enhances the potential for peptide modification and facilitates the synthesis of polyazide derivatives that can be suitable for dendrimeric cores. This reaction yields good results and provides a scalable route, successfully accommodating a wide range of aromatic and heteroaromatic methyl bromides, while achieving excellent chiral integrity and 100% 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity. We also explored the application of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted [1H]&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl phenylalanine conjugate as a directing group for C(sp2)&#8208;H di&#8208;halogenation.

This review surveys recent progress in the synthesis of extended aromatic quinolizinium derivatives via intramolecular SNAr and oxidative 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. Conventional thermal approaches are discussed alongside emerging, sustainable activation methods such as electrosynthesis and photochemical processes. Particular attention is given to the mechanistic influence of leaving groups and substituents, as well as current limitations and opportunities to broaden the synthetic scope.

In this review, we explore recent advancements in synthesizingextended aromatic quinoliziniumderivatives via intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr) or oxidative 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization mechanisms. We first explore their historical synthesis through standard thermal activation and then focus on their synthesis using more efficient and greener activation methods, such as electrosynthesis or photochemical processes. We compare the efficiency of these methods and rationalize through a mechanistic point of view how the choice of leaving groups and substituents on the aromatic backbone affects synthesis outcomes and reaction scope. Finally, we give an overview of the readily accessible quinolizinium skeletons prepared through this intramolecular reaction and explore the current challenges that remain to be addressed to expand their synthetic toolbox.

A TFA&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 9&#8208;fluorene propargylic alcohol with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls as nucleophiles resulted in functionalized conjugated diene&#8208;dione&#8208;appended and propargyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives of fluorenone. In contrast, the reaction under Lewis acid conditions afforded an unusual spirocyclic product, and a plausible mechanism is provided. The scope and synthetic utility of the products have also been investigated.

A TFA&#8208;catalyzed reaction of fluorene propargylic alcohol with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls as nucleophiles, resulting in highly functionalized conjugated diene&#8208;diones appended and propargyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives of fluorenone, has been developed. A plausible mechanism for forming title compounds via allene and propargyl carbocation intermediates has been proposed. On the other hand, the reaction under Lewis acid conditions (BF3OEt2) afforded an unusual spirocyclic product, and a plausible mechanism is provided. The scope and synthetic utility of the synthesized products by reduction and base&#8208;promoted cyclization have also been investigated. Spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal XRD of the compounds have been utilized to determine the structure of the products.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Glycosylation of d&#8208;Idopyranosyl and 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl Donors: Toward the Repeating Unit of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c Capsular Polysaccharide</title>

A comprehensive glycosylation study of diversely protected and activated d&#8208;idopyranosyl and 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl donors using intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling strategies is reported. Intramolecular aglycon delivery afforded 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;idopyranosides, while intermolecular glycosylation yielded chromatographically separable &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked disaccharides, the latter corresponding to the repeating unit of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c capsular polysaccharide.

The synthesis of disaccharide mimics of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c capsular polysaccharide, a major pathogen associated with campylobacteriosis, is challenged by the presence of a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside. Herein, the development of a synthetic route to orthogonally protected d&#8208;ido&#8208;hexo&#8208; and 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl donors is reported bearing diverse anomeric leaving groups, which represents, to the best of knowledge, the second direct access to 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides from ido&#8208;configured precursors. These donors were evaluated in intramolecular aglycon delivery (IAD) and intermolecular glycosylation protocols. While IAD enabled complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity with hexosyl donors, it failed with the heptosyl analog. Intermolecular glycosylation provided mixtures of anomers, but the use of a 7&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;protected heptosyl donor allowed access to the disaccharide in good yield, with chromatographic separation of the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers. Structural analysis revealed unexpected conformational behavior, with the &#945;&#8208;disaccharide adopting the 1C4 chair conformation. This work establishes a foundation for the synthesis of C. jejuni HS:4c disaccharides and represents a step toward well&#8208;defined sugar&#8208;based vaccines candidates against campylobacteriosis.

Cross&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;supported copper(II) biocomposite (CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2) catalyzed one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step synthesis of thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines via N&#8208;aryl propargylamine intermediates and conversion of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines to formamides using Vilsmeier reagent.

Facile synthetic routes for the conversion of a series of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines to thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and formamides are described. A cross&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;supported copper(II) biocomposite (CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2) was employed as a heterogeneous catalyst in a one&#8208;pot multicomponent reaction involving primary amines, formaldehyde, terminal alkynes, and isothiocyanates in toluene, yielding thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines in moderate to good yields (25%&#8211;70%) via N&#8208;aryl propargylamine intermediates. Additionally, N&#8208;formylation of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines using the Vilsmeier reagent afforded formamides in high yields (70%&#8211;88%). A total of 20 thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine derivatives and 22 formamide derivatives were successfully isolated. All isolated products were characterized by 1H and 13C {1H} NMR and HRMS spectroscopy. The CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2 biocomposite catalyst was recyclable for up to three catalytic cycles through simple filtration. Reaction intermediates for both transformations were identified by LC&#8208;MS analysis. Furthermore, the structures of two thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine compounds, 4h and 4t, were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <dc:description>
An alkyne oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition domino reaction containing nitro groups and alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones, employing gold catalyst, furnishes a diverse array of complex isoxazolidine&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds in moderate to good yields, with up to excellent diastereoselectivities. The domino process features simple operation, step economy, and atom economy.

Herein, we described an efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed redox cycloisomerization/[3+2] dipolar cycloaddition domino reaction of o&#8208;(alkynyl)nitrobenzenes. The domino process involves the in situ generation of &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes via intramolecular redox reactions of alkynes and nitro functional groups, followed by the formation of nitrones and subsequent intramolecular [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition reaction to furnish a diverse array of complex isoxazolidine&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds in moderate to good yields, with up to excellent diastereoselectivities.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Elacestrant, an FDA&#8208;Approved Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 26, 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core skeleton of elacestrant was synthesized by one&#8208;pot conversion of 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;tetralone into a cyclic olefin, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclic olefin arylation. Two different strategies were established for the transformation of this intermediate into the target compound: reductive amination of an aldehyde and nucleophilic substitution of a bromo compound with the core skeleton.

Herein, we report an efficient and scalable synthesis of the core skeleton of elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader used in breast cancer treatment. The present synthesis features simple synthetic transformations, involving one&#8208;pot conversion of 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;tetralone into a cyclic olefin followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed arylation of the cyclic olefin (iodometathesis) with a diaryliodonium salt as a key strategy to achieve the core skeleton on a gram scale. This procedure was extended to the total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;elacestrant by employing two different coupling strategies: reductive amination of an aldehyde and nucleophilic substitution of a bromo compound with the core skeleton.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Difluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 26, 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a photoinduced synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds using a combined method of fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Utilizing benzimidazoline derivatives as photoreductant and hydrogen atom donor, difluoromethylarenes were synthesized through the C&#8211;F bond reduction of trifluoromethylarenes.

The difluoromethyl group is a bioisostere of hydroxy and sulfanyl groups. The photocatalytic reduction of trifluoromethyl groups is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds. We have developed a photoinduced synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds using a combined method of fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Utilizing benzimidazoline derivatives as photoreductant and hydrogen atom donor, difluoromethylarenes were synthesized through the C&#8211;F bond reduction of trifluoromethylarenes. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoreduction proceeded via an electron&#8208;donor&#8211;acceptor complex between trifluoromethylarenes and benzimidazoline derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]oxepines Through an HFIP&#8208;Promoted Peri&#8208;Selective Arene&#8211;Epoxide Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 26, 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient two&#8208;step strategy for the synthesis of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]oxepines was developed via peri&#8208;selective intramolecular epoxide&#8208;opening of C1&#8208;tethered naphthalene epoxides. Regioselectivity was achieved through steric blocking at C2, and the method was demonstrated to be mild, scalable, and extendable to the diastereoselective synthesis of tetrahydrooxepino[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indoles.

We describe a hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8208;promoted epoxide ring&#8208;opening cyclization of readily accessible 2&#8208;[(2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1&#8208;naphthyloxy)methyl]&#8208;3&#8208;aryloxiranes, proceeding via a regioselective 7&#8208;endo cyclization at the peri (C8) position of the naphthalene ring. This transformation provides a new class of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]oxepine derivatives with complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The C2 substituent on the naphthalene framework, along with the &#960;&#8208;activating aryl group on the epoxide, plays a pivotal role in enabling the reaction. The method operates under mild conditions, tolerates a broad substrate scope, and is readily amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy is underscored by its successful extension to the diastereoselective synthesis of oxepino[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indoles.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Glycals With Alkynes via C&#8211;H Activation: Synthesis of Pyridone&#8208; and Pyranone&#8208;Fused Sugar Derivatives</title>

Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation of glycal derivatives with alkynes enables the efficient synthesis of pyridone&#8208; and pyranone&#8208;fused sugar frameworks. The reactions proceed smoothly under mild conditions and tolerate a variety of amide and carboxylic acid substrates, providing a versatile platform for the construction of complex carbohydrate&#8208;based heterocycles.

Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation reactions of glycal derivatives with alkynes have been developed, providing an efficient approach to structurally diverse pyridone&#8208; and pyranone&#8208;fused sugar frameworks. The catalytic system of [Cp*RhCl2]2/Ag2CO3 in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane effectively promoted the annulation to give the pyridone&#8208;fused product. The methodology was applicable to a wide range of glycal&#8208;derived primary and secondary amides as well as carboxylic acids, affording the corresponding annulated sugars in moderate to excellent yields. Remarkably, the carboxylic acid&#8208;based annulation proceeded under mild conditions (40&#176;C&#8211;80&#176;C) to give pyranone&#8208;fused derivatives in high yields. The annulated products underwent smooth acidic deprotection to furnish the corresponding triols without decomposition, demonstrating the robustness of the fused heterocyclic frameworks.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of [18F]Togni Reagent I: An Electrophilic 18F&#8208;Labeled Trifluoromethylating Reagent for Positron Emission Tomography Tracer Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 26, 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Togni reagent I, one of the most used electrophilic trifluoromethylating reagents, has been radiolabeled with fluorine&#8208;18 starting from the widely available fluoro&#8208;benziodoxole and the [18F]Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent. To demonstrate the broad potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, aliphatic carboxylic acids were successfully converted into their 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylated analogs via metallaphotoredox catalysis.

The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is a ubiquitous motif in drug discovery campaigns due to its ability to markedly improve the ADME properties of small molecules while maintaining potency. The isotopologue labeling of CF3&#8208;bearing drugs with fluorine&#8208;18 has gained attention for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, their radiolabeling via conventional 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylation methods relies almost completely on nucleophilic and radical [18F]CF3&#8208;reagents, whereas there remains no general means to incorporate a formal [18F]CF3+ into PET tracer candidates. Herein, we disclose the realization of a novel electrophilic 18F&#8208;labeled trifluoromethylating reagent based on the family of 10&#8208;&#955;&#8208;3 hypervalent iodines: [18F]Togni reagent I. The method uses nucleophilic ligand substitution at iodine by the [18F]Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent, providing [18F]Togni reagent I in a radiochemical yield of 4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8% and a molar activity of 15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.6&#8201;GBq/&#956;mol. Initial studies on the utility of this reagent demonstrate the direct, late&#8208;stage formation of C(sp3)&#8722;[18F]CF3 bonds via metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated conversion of naturally abundant carboxylic acids. Hence, this work illustrates the potential of the novel electrophilic [18F]CF3&#8208;reagent as a complementary approach leading to valuable 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylated architectures in PET tracer development.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Based H2S Scavengers: Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules containing electron&#8208;deficient alkene functionalities (Michael acceptors) have been synthesized and evaluated for their H2S scavenging properties. The most effective compounds exhibit performance comparable to commercial chemicals while displaying lower ecotoxicity toward marine organisms.

Michael acceptors derived from biomass resources, such as carbohydrates, have been synthesized and their H2S scavenging properties studied. The most promising candidates were compared with the commercial H2S scavenger MEA&#8208;triazine by studying the aqueous phase scavenging reactions using in&#8201;situ Raman spectroscopy and the gas&#8211;liquid reactions were evaluated in a flow setup. Based on cost and scavenging efficiency considerations, the industrially most promising candidates were submitted to ecotoxicity studies. We have found three families of Michael acceptors, which are readily available and can be tailor&#8208;made to serve as sulfide scavengers under different conditions.

         <title>Magic Blue Initiated SN2&#8211;Type Ring Opening of Azetidines with Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes/Heteroarenes: Formal Synthesis of Nonracemic Tolterodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy for the synthesis of racemic and nonracemic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;di(hetero)aryl propylamines in up to 98% yield and 62% ee has been developed. The transformation involves Magic Blue initiated SN2&#8208;type ring opening of activated azetidines with arenes/heteroarenes under mild reaction conditions in THF solvent system and enabled the formal synthesis of optically active tolterodine, a clinically used antimuscarinic agent.

A simple and atom&#8208;economical protocol to access racemic and nonracemic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;diaryl/heteroaryl&#8208;substituted propylamines in excellent yields (up to 98%) and with moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 62%) starting from azetidines and electron rich arenes/heteroarenes is described. The reaction involves Magic Blue&#8208;initiated and incipient SbCl5&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;type nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of activated azetidines with electron rich arenes/heteroarene under mild reaction conditions.

     alt="Magic Blue Initiated SN2&#8211;Type Ring Opening of Azetidines with Electron-Rich Arenes/Heteroarenes: Formal Synthesis of Nonracemic Tolterodine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward strategy for the synthesis of racemic and nonracemic &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-di(hetero)aryl propylamines in up to 98% yield and 62% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; has been developed. The transformation involves Magic Blue initiated S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type ring opening of activated azetidines with arenes/heteroarenes under mild reaction conditions in THF solvent system and enabled the formal synthesis of optically active tolterodine, a clinically used antimuscarinic agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and atom-economical protocol to access racemic and nonracemic &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-diaryl/heteroaryl-substituted propylamines in excellent yields (up to 98%) and with moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 62%) starting from azetidines and electron rich arenes/heteroarenes is described. The reaction involves Magic Blue-initiated and incipient SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type nucleophilic ring-opening of activated azetidines with electron rich arenes/heteroarene under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Induced [2 + 2] Photodimerization of Vinylenes Within a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Cage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homodimers and heterodimers of different guests were included in a water&#8208;soluble cage, which effectively facilitates the photodimerization reaction under light irradiation due to the preorganization by the cage confinement.

Molecular confinement is a viable method to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of chemical species. Metal&#8211;organic cages, which have large void spaces within, are especially attractive entities for encapsulating various guests. Here, a water&#8208;soluble flexible metal&#8211;organic cage was used to confine two guest molecules, as either homo&#8208; or heterodimers with a high uptake efficiency. Photo irradiation of the inclusion complexes results in a smooth photo [2 + 2] dimerization reaction in aqueous solution despite the flexibility of this metal&#8211;organic cage. The preorganization of two molecules within the cage was responsible for the smooth photo&#8208;dimerization, both for the homodimer and heterodimer. Kinetic study of the photoreaction revealed a pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order reaction, implying a preformed dimer of guests within the cage was responsible for the reaction.

         <title>Cyclization of Carbonyl Electrophiles via Dual HAT/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular cyclization of ester and ketone electrophiles to produce cyclic ketone and alcohol products, respectively, is reported. The reaction is enabled by photocatalytic reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover and proceeds via formation of a nucleophilic benzylic carbanion equivalent.

Photocatalytic reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover is a versatile platform for achieving carbon&#8211;carbon bond formations under mild conditions and is complementary to traditional radical reactivity. Herein, we report a study on the reactivity of esters and ketones under this platform to produce cyclic ketone and alcohol products, respectively. The process is amenable to a variety of functionalized systems, and mechanistic experiments suggest intermediacy of both a benzylic radical and anion arising from photocatalytic reduction.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of Benzoxazole Derivatives with Diazo Compounds Catalyzed by Fe(OTf)3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzooxazole undergoes ring&#8208;opening reactions with diazo compounds under the catalysis of Fe(OTf)3, yielding products containing phenolic hydroxyl groups and amides, which exhibit potential antibacterial properties. This reaction offers benefits including high yields, broad substrate compatibility, and efficient atomic utilization.

An efficient approach for the ring&#8208;opening of benzoxazole derivatives involves utilizing diazo compounds in the presence of Fe(OTf)3 as a catalyst. This method enables the efficient conversion of the oxazole ring into highly functionalized products that bear N&#8208;amino, amide, and hydroxy groups. This approach overcomes the strong steric hindrance of benzoxazole when it carries substituents at the C2 position. And it has the advantages of high yield, broad substrate scope, efficient atom utilization, and so on. Moreover, some of these compounds exhibit antibacterial activity, which offer a valuable reference for the future development of novel antimicrobial agents.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl sulfonium salts have been extensively used in the photoredox trifluoroethylations, Fe&#8208;catalyzed insertions, cyclopropanations, Johnson&#8211;Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions, annulations, trifluoromethylcyclopropylation, and others for the facile synthesis of trifluoroethylated and trifluoromethylated compounds. This review provides a comprehensive summary of these reagents, highlighting their advantages and significant applications.

2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl sulfonium salts have emerged as the highly versatile trifluoroalkyl reagents in modern organic synthesis, due to their exceptional stability, ready availability, and ease of handling. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethyl diphenylsulfonium salt has enabled many innovative trifluoroalkylation strategies, including photoredox trifluoroethylations, Fe&#8208;catalyzed insertions, cyclopropanations, Johnson&#8211;Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions, and [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] annulations, for the concise synthesis of a great deal of trifluoroethylated compounds and a variety of trifluoromethylated cyclopropanes, epoxides, aziridines, pyrrole derivatives, and pyrazolines, respectively, with high diastereoselectivity. This salt has also been used as an efficient cross&#8208;coupling partner in the Pd&#8208; or Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed Mizoroki&#8211;Heck, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura, and Sonogashira arylation reactions. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethyl sulfonium analogues, including pentafluoroethyl, &#945;&#8208;diazo trifluoroethyl, and 1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl sulfonium salts, have been developed to meet a wider range of synthetic requirements. These reagents can readily introduce pentafluoroethyl group, serve as an equivalent of trifluoromethyl carbyne cation, allow the simultaneous transfer of both trifluoromethyl and diazo groups, and enable the direct radical trifluoromethylcyclopropylation, highlighting their significant potentials for synthetic applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. This review provides a comprehensive summary of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl diphenylsulfonium salt and its analogues in organic synthesis, with emphasis on trifluoroalkylation and annulation.

         <title>Annulative Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Ketothioamides with &#945;&#8208;Ester Sulfoxonium Ylides: A Practical Route to Functionalized Thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;Ones</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free annulative coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with &#945;&#8208;ester sulfoxonium ylides affords diverse thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;ones via concurrent C&#63743;S/C&#63743;N bond formation under mild reaction conditions with excellent yields and scalability.

A metal&#8208;free annulative coupling strategy has been developed to synthesize functionalized thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;ones from &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and &#945;&#8208;ester sulfoxonium ylides. This cascade process proceeds via concurrent C&#63743;S and C&#63743;N bond formation under mild conditions, delivering a wide range of thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. The method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, with most products isolated via filtration without chromatography. The scalability and synthetic utility were demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale synthesis and oxidative late&#8208;stage functionalization, highlighting the potential of this strategy for accessing structurally diverse heterocycles.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Skeletal Editing of Aromatics: Advances in Carbon&#8208;to&#8208;Nitrogen and Nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;Carbon Transmutation</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom skeletal editing has emerged as a transformative strategy in modern organic synthesis. Among the most compelling advances are carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8208;to&#8208;N) and nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;carbon (N&#8208;to&#8208;C) transmutations, which enable precise atomic substitutions within heteroaromatic frameworks without disrupting the surrounding molecular architecture. This review comprehensively summarizes recent developments in these two complementary transformations, highlighting both mechanistic innovations and synthetic applications.

The selective modification of aromatic ring systems through single&#8208;atom skeletal editing has emerged as a transformative strategy in modern organic synthesis. Among the most compelling advances are carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8208;to&#8208;N) and nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;carbon (N&#8208;to&#8208;C) transmutations, which enable precise atomic substitutions within heteroaromatic frameworks without disrupting the surrounding molecular architecture. This review comprehensively summarizes recent developments in these two complementary transformations, highlighting both mechanistic innovations and synthetic applications. C&#8208;to&#8208;N transmutation strategies, including oxidative ring expansion and electrophilic rearrangement, have enabled the conversion of quinolines and related azaarenes into pharmaceutically relevant quinazolines. Conversely, N&#8208;to&#8208;C editing approaches such as ring&#8208;opening, skeletal rearrangement, and rearomatization allow the deconstruction of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles like pyridines into substituted benzenes. These methodologies have opened new avenues in drug design, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and heterocycle diversification. The review also discusses the current limitations, mechanistic insights, and future opportunities for extending single atom editing to broader classes of aromatic systems, positioning this field at the forefront of molecular editing and precision synthesis.

         <title>Carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of 1&#8208;Iodoglycals Mediated by the N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyst PEPPSI: Preparation of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was developed for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides. Using Pyridine&#8208;Enhanced Precatalyst Preparation, Stabilization, and Initiation (PEPPSI&#8208;IPr) catalysis and Mo(CO)6 as a solid CO source, the reaction enables selective carbonylation of three components in synthetically useful yields, providing a versatile platform for accessing new glycochemistry derivatives.

Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has been widely explored, particularly in the development of pharmaceutically relevant structures. Its carbonylative variant enables the insertion of a CO bridge, granting access to a variety of bioactive biaryl ketone scaffolds. Herein, we describe a carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura strategy for the preparation of a series of C&#8208;acyl glycosides, thereby expanding the chemical space for the development of new derivatives in glycochemistry. The reaction proceeds under Pyridine&#8208;Enhanced Precatalyst Preparation, Stabilization, and Initiation (PEPPSI&#8208;IPr) ([1,3&#8208;Bis(2,6&#8208;Diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](3&#8208;chloropyridyl)palladium(II) dichloride) catalysis, employing Mo(CO)6 as a solid CO source for the in situ generation of CO, which enables the selective formation of the carbonylated products. The desired compounds were obtained in synthetically useful yields (up to 84%).

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Bromo Succinimide Enables Achmatowicz Rearrangement with Oxone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic version of N&#8208;bromo succinimide (NBS)&#8208;mediated Achmatowicz rearrangement was documented, featuring (1) employment of NBS as the catalyst with low loading (5%) and (2) the use of nontoxic, environmentally friendly, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, inexpensive, and shelf&#8208;stable oxone as the terminal oxidant. The efficacy and synthetic utility of this protocol are fully demonstrated, representing a good surrogate of stoichiometric NBS.

Achmatowicz rearrangement (AchR) has been widely used for the synthesis of various heterocyclic building blocks and natural products. N&#8208;bromo succinimide (NBS) was often used as a stochiometric oxidation reagent to promote AchR with many synthetic advantages; however, the generation of stochiometric succinimide as the byproduct is undesirable from the perspective of green chemistry and occasionally complicates the purification process in a large scale. Herein, we report the development of catalytic NBS (5&#8201;mol%) for AchR with oxone as the terminal oxidant, which generates only small amount (5%) of the succinimide byproduct and substochiometric K2SO4 (95%). The 24&#8208;times reduction of NBS (from 1.2 equivalent to catalytic 5&#8201;mol%) substantially improves the greenness of this protocol and greatly eases the purification of the AchR product. The efficiency and utility of this protocol are consistently superior to the NBS condition and demonstrated with the broad substrate scope (21 examples including steroid substrates), excellent yields, and scalability. Moreover, mechanistic studies suggested that NBS initiated the AchR reaction and the concomitant bromide byproduct could be oxidized by oxone into reactive brominating species in the form of NBS and/or HOBr for subsequent AchR reaction. We believe this new catalytic NBS protocol will find wide applications in organic synthesis.

         <title>Di&#8208;tert&#8208;Butyl&#8208;Peroxide&#8211;CuI Promoted Radical Hydrogermylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement protocol for the radical alkene hydrogermylation with hydrogermanes initiated by tBuOOtBu and CuI in methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether (MTBE) is reported. The method has good generality regarding alkene substrate&#8208;types and triorganogermanes. It is particularly well&#8208;suited for the hydrogermylation of indenes, offering a new synthetic approach to original 2&#8208;germylated indanes.

A new protocol for alkene hydrogermylation with hydrogermanes involving a radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism initiated by di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) and CuI in methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether (MTBE) is disclosed. The method has good generality regarding both appropriate alkene substrate&#8208;types and hydrogermanes, and compares well to other existing protocols, sometimes improving them, while being easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement. The developed system is particularly well&#8208;suited for indenes and allows for the preparation of original 2&#8208;germylated indanes through a previously unexplored approach.

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis for the Cascade Silylation and Cyclization of N&#8208;Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient strategy for the synthesis of silylated oxindoles from N&#8208;acrylamide with hydrosilane is described. This protocol enables access to diverse, high&#8208;yielding products with excellent functional group tolerance. The mechanistic study suggests that the process involves dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalytic silyl radical formation, followed by a cascade of radical addition and cyclization.

A photoredox silylation protocol of N&#8208;acrylamides with stable hydrosilanes as radical precursors is reported, affording a series of silylated oxindoles in yields up to 87%. This transformation proceeded through a tandem radical addition and cyclization cascade. This protocol is advantageous, as it features broad functional tolerance and mild reaction conditions. The successful late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug hybrids further demonstrated the utility of this method. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the key silyl radical is generated via a crucial synergistic photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalytic system.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Heteroditopic Receptors for Ion&#8208;Pair Binding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bond (ChB)&#8208;based heteroditopic receptors for ion and allosteric ion&#8208;pair binding.

Chalcogen bond (ChB)&#8211;based heteroditopic receptors integrating neutral or positively charged thiazole motifs as anion binding sites and glycol chains as cation binding sites into a host framework were synthesized. 1H NMR titration experiments revealed that the neutral receptors showed stronger binding ability for cations than for anions, whereas the protonated receptors demonstrated significantly enhanced anion binding but largely diminished cation association. In solution, the charge&#8211;neutral receptors displayed ion&#8208;pair binding due to the allosteric effect from the bound cation and anion. Single&#8211;crystal X&#8211;ray analysis demonstrated the ion pairs are stabilized by the thiazoles through ChB interactions, the glycol chain through ion&#8211;dipole interactions, and cation&#8211;anion interactions.

         <title>Synthesis of C3v&#8208;Symmetrical 1,3,5&#8208;Tris&#8208;O&#8208;Me&#8208;Calix[6]arene: New Perspectives</title>

We developed an efficient method for the synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;tris&#8208;O&#8208;Me&#8208;calix[6]arenes. These molecular platforms were further derivatized selectively on the small and large rims, producing notably a tris&#8208;imidazole calix[6]arene&#8208;based ligand forming a biomimetic funnel complex upon coordinating Zn2+, with an open cavity suitable for the inclusion of a bulky dopamine derivative.

The alternate O&#8208;methylation of p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[6]arene is a well&#8208;known method leading to the C3v&#8208;symmetrical 1,3,5&#8208;tris&#8208;O&#8208;Me&#8208;p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[6]arene, a key compound for the development of platforms for supramolecular studies and in particular for the access to receptors in host&#8211;guest chemistry. The alternate O&#8208;methylation of the parent de&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated calix[6]arene remained elusive, precluding the development of similar C3v&#8208;symmetrical 1,3,5&#8208;tris&#8208;O&#8208;methylated receptors with an open cavity devoid of bulky tBu groups at the large rim.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Oxidation and Carbene Transfer Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Cyclopropane Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophotochemical method merges electrosynthesis and photochemical to enable a one&#8208;pot oxidation/carbene transfer cascade, converting stable hydrazones into cyclopropanes. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free method operates under mild conditions, providing a green and practical alternative for synthesizing diverse cyclopropane derivatives.

Electrophotochemical synthesis is emerging as a powerful and sustainable methodology in organic synthesis. This work describes the successful integration of photochemical and electrosynthesis to achieve an oxidation and carbene transfer cascade reaction for the synthesis of cyclopropane compounds. This strategy operates without stoichiometric oxidants or reductants, enabling efficient and highly selective redox transformations under mild conditions. Key to this process is the in&#8201;situ electrochemical generation of diazo compounds from stable hydrazones, which subsequently undergo photolytic carbene formation and cyclopropanation with olefin derivatives in a single pot. This approach effectively mitigates the handling and stability issues associated with isolated diazo compounds. The reaction system was optimized, identifying acetonitrile as the optimal solvent with graphite and platinum electrodes in the presence of NH4OAc and KI, achieving high yields of various cyclopropane derivatives. This electrophotochemical method provides a practical, metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free, and environmentally friendly alternative for accessing valuable cyclopropane architectures.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dihalogenative Cyclization of Amide&#8208;Fused 1,6&#8208;Enynes for the Synthesis of Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>

         <title>Design, Stereoselective Synthesis, and in Silico Evaluation of Novel Pyran&#8208;Based C&#8208;Fucosides as Potential COX&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>

Eight &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;aryl&#8208;L&#8208;fucosides were forged from 3,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;L&#8208;fucal via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with ArBF3K under open air conditions at room temperature, with a yield up to 94% and only &#945; stereoselectivity. In&#8208;silico ADMET and COX&#8208;2 docking identified low&#8208;toxicity hits (2, 7) surpassing rofecoxib affinity, validating the potential strategy for C&#8208;glycoside drug discovery.

C&#8208;Glycosides represent a class of structurally robust and pharmacologically significant molecules due to their stable anomeric C&#8211;C bonds and diverse biological profiles. Herein, a novel series of stereodefined C&#8208;fucosides, specifically (2S,3S,6R)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;aryl/aryloxy&#8208;3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3&#8208;ols (1&#8211;8), was efficiently synthesized from 3,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;L&#8208;fucal via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with diverse aryltrifluoroborates. The reactions proceeded under mild conditions with excellent stereoselectivity, delivering high yields (78%&#8211;94%). All &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides were thoroughly characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and optical rotation. To evaluate their therapeutic potential, an integrated in silico assessment was conducted. ADMET profiling using SwissADME, BOILED&#8208;Egg, and ProTox&#8208;II predicted favorable pharmacokinetics and acceptable toxicity, identifying compounds 3, 6, and 8 as low&#8208;toxicity candidates (Class 5). Molecular docking against cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2), a validated anti&#8208;inflammatory target, revealed strong binding affinities. Notably, compounds 7 and 2 exhibited docking scores comparable or superior to the reference drug rofecoxib (Vioxx), with MM/GBSA binding energies of &#8722;31.99 and &#8722;35.26&#8201;kcal/mol, respectively. Compound 7 demonstrated a unique binding mode involving hydrogen bonding with TYR355 and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with TYR385 and TRP387, whereas compound 2 formed the most distinctive electrostatic interaction among all tested ligands. These results underscore the successful synthesis, structural characterization, and promising computational profile of these pyran&#8208;based C&#8208;fucosides as potential COX&#8208;2 inhibitors.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of the Cap Tetrasaccharide of Leishmania Lipophosphoglycan</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and convergent synthesis of the Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG) terminal cap tetrasaccharide has been achieved through a &#8220;cyanide effect&#8221;&#8208;mediated regioselective axial benzoylation and AuCl3&#8211;tBuCN catalyzed 1,2&#8208;trans galactosylation without neighboring group participation, providing efficient, scalable, and reproducible access to the LPG cap for biological evaluation.

Leishmaniasis remains an ignored tropical disease with urgent need for safe and effective vaccines. The lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) of Leishmania parasites is a key virulence factor, and its terminal cap tetrasaccharide represents a structurally conserved antigen suitable for vaccine development. Herein, we report a concise and practical route to synthesize the cap tetrasaccharide. This synthesis strategy highlights (i) regioselective axial benzoylation of mannosyl units via the &#8220;cyanide effect,&#8221; providing quick and orthogonally protected building blocks in large scale, and (ii) highly stereoselective glycosidation under AuCl3&#8211;tBuCN cooperative catalysis, which ensures efficient formation of challenging &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;galactosidic linkages without neighboring participation. These protocols are operationally simple, minimize protecting group manipulations, and are highly reproducible, thus enabling in&#8208;depth biological studies and translational implementation.

         <title>Solvent Controlled NBS&#8208;Driven Divergent Bromo&#8208;Lactonization of Ortho&#8208;Styryl Benzamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a metal&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;controlled bromo&#8208;lactonization of (E)&#8208;N&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;styryl benzamides using NBS under ambient conditions. A bromine radical&#8208;bromonium sequence enables trans&#8208;selective cyclization via the amide oxygen. Solvent dictates the outcome: acetonitrile gives bromo&#8208;imino&#8208;lactones, while wet methanol triggers oxime hydrolysis to form 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins.

We developed a metal&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;controlled protocol for the bromo&#8208;lactonization of (E)&#8208;N&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;styryl benzamides using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the sole reagent under ambient conditions. The reaction proceeded through an NBS&#8208;derived bromine radical that evolved into a bromonium&#8208;ion intermediate, enabling a trans&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization exclusively through the amide oxygen. The reaction outcome depended strongly on the solvent: acetonitrile furnished bromo&#8208;imino&#8208;lactones, whereas wet methanol promoted oxime hydrolysis in the final step to afford 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins. This NBS&#8208;driven and solvent&#8208;directed strategy therefore expanded the synthetic utility of prefunctionalized amides and provided a sustainable approach to oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Eighteen Pallavicinia Diterpenoids with Three Distinct Skeletons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of eighteen pallavicinia diterpenoids with three distinct skeletons was achieved employing a bioinspired skeletal diversification strategy. Among these, (&#177;)&#8208;pallambins G/H, (&#177;)&#8208;pallaviambin C, (&#177;)&#8208;pallasubcin A, (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinin A, and (&#177;)&#8208;pallavisubin B were synthesized for the first time. The structures of (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinolide D and (&#177;)&#8208;pallasubcin A were revised.

The total synthesis of eighteen structurally complex pallavicinia diterpenoids with three distinct carbon skeletons was accomplished from the second&#8208;generation common intermediate 19 employing our bioinspired skeletal diversification strategy. Among these, (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinolide D (4), (&#177;)&#8208;pallambins G/H (11/12), (&#177;)&#8208;pallaviambin C (13), (&#177;)&#8208;pallasubcin A (16), and (&#177;)&#8208;pallavisubin B (44b) were synthesized prior to the reports of their isolation. The structures of (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinolide D (4) and (&#177;)&#8208;pallasubcin A (16) were revised based on the X&#8208;ray crystallographic and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analyses. The total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinin A (17) was achieved for the first time. The synthetic route of (&#177;)&#8208;pallavicinolide A (1) was the shortest.

&lt;p&gt;The total synthesis of eighteen structurally complex &lt;i&gt;pallavicinia&lt;/i&gt; diterpenoids with three distinct carbon skeletons was accomplished from the second-generation common intermediate &lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt; employing our bioinspired skeletal diversification strategy. Among these, (&#177;)-pallavicinolide D (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), (&#177;)-pallambins G/H (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;), (&#177;)-pallaviambin C (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;), (&#177;)-pallasubcin A (&lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;), and (&#177;)-pallavisubin B (&lt;b&gt;44b&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized prior to the reports of their isolation. The structures of (&#177;)-pallavicinolide D (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and (&#177;)-pallasubcin A (&lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;) were revised based on the X-ray crystallographic and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analyses. The total synthesis of (&#177;)-pallavicinin A (&lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;) was achieved for the first time. The synthetic route of (&#177;)-pallavicinolide A (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was the shortest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in the Synthetic Approaches to &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones: Scope, Mechanism, and Application</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino ketones (&#945;&#8208;AKs) are highly valued structural motifs in the realms of synthetic and medicinal chemistry due to their prevalent presence in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral building blocks. Significant progress has been made in recent years regarding the development of effective catalytic methods for their synthesis, including transition&#8208;metal catalysis, organocatalysis, dual photoredox catalysis, and catalyst&#8208;free transformations.

&#945;&#8208;amino ketones (&#945;&#8208;AKs) serve as valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry because they are found in many pharmaceuticals and molecules that are biologically active. Different catalytic strategies for their synthesis have been developed as a result of their structural diversity and functional versatility. This review offers a thorough summary of recent developments (2020&#8211;2025) in the catalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;AKs, emphasizing two main categories: enantioselective (chiral) and achiral methods. Chiral techniques, which offer high enantioselectivity and wide substrate scopes, include transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, photoredox catalysis, and their combinations. Despite being simpler and more scalable, chiral strategies are useful for quickly building &#945;&#8208;AK scaffolds. With a focus on reaction design, mechanism, tolerance to functional groups, and synthetic utility, recent synthetic approaches are discussed. In addition to outlining the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in extending the synthetic accessibility and application of these privileged molecular architectures, the review highlights the advancements that have been made in both fields.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Reactions of Imines Proceeding Through Aza&#8208;Breslow Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC catalysis has amply demonstrated its potential in promoting both intermolecular and intramolecular umpolung reactions of imines. This strategy has enabled the efficient synthesis of a wide range of valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds. The reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations will also be discussed in this review.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as efficient catalysts for promoting umpolung reactions of aldehydes and enals. Recently, the NHCs have been successfully used for catalyzing the umpolung reactions of aldimines through the formation of aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates. This article provides a systematic review of the research progress in the polarity reversal of imines and related reactions catalyzed by NHCs, along with a detailed discussion and summary of the underlying reaction mechanisms. The review is organized and categorized according to the types of NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving imines.

         <title>Catalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic summary of aldehydes decarbonylation reactions, emphasizes recent progress, and outlines future directions for the development of decarbonylative strategies.

This review highlights the expanding role of decarbonylation in modern organic chemistry. Inspired by nature's enzymatic pathways, aldehyde decarbonylation, which enables C&#8722;C bond cleavage with the release of carbon monoxide, has emerged as a powerful and versatile transformation in sustainable synthesis, complex molecule modification, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances (2021&#8211;2025) in both direct decarbonylation and decarbonylative functionalization of aldehydes, the two most significant classes of decarbonylation reactions. Special attention is given to cutting&#8208;edge developments in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, including Rh&#8208;, Ir&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;based systems, as well as photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free protocols, which typically proceed through radical pathways and achieve high selectivity under mild conditions. By bridging classical catalytic methods with emerging radical&#8208;driven approaches, this review underscores the growing impact of decarbonylative chemistry in green synthesis, pharmaceutical innovation, and biomass valorization.

Total Synthesis of Bis(tetrahydroisoquinoline) Alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;Renieramycin M, (&#8722;)&#8208;Renieramycin S, (&#8722;)&#8208;Renieramycin T, (&#8722;)&#8208;Jorumycin, (&#8722;)&#8208; Jorunnamycin A, and (&#8722;)&#8208;Jorunnamycin C</title>

Six renieramycin&#8208;type alkaloids containing three different A&#8208;ring structures, (&#8211;)&#8208; jorunnamycins A and C, jorumycin, and renieramycin M, S and T, were synthesized by a short approach based on a regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclization coupling. Owing to strategic use of the Parikh&#8722;Doering oxidation at two points in the synthesis, the synthetic route only involves one functional group protection step.

A new approach to antitumor renieramycin&#8208;type alkaloids is developed based on a regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclization coupling of the phenolic aldehyde and amino alcohol partners, which both were obtained from commercial N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine through a common synthetic process. The employment of Parikh&#8722;Doering oxidation with good functionality tolerance and successive biomimetic A&#8208;ring modification facilitates the concise and universal approach, the utility of which is illustrated by the first synthesis of renieramycin S in 19 steps, as well as the collective syntheses of jorunnamycins A, C, jorumycin, renieramycins M, and T in 16&#8211;18 steps.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Antioxidative Activity of Natural and Nonnatural Casuarinin Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Casuarinin is a C&#8208;glycosidic ellagitannin, a promising functional ingredient for its health benefits. In this study, natural and nonnatural casuarinin analogs were designed and synthesized by a strategy based on a chemical &#8220;beachhead&#8221;. The antioxidant activities of the resulting analogs varied with their structures, offering a new approach to develop ellagitannins with improved or novel functions.

Ellagitannins are polyphenolic compounds that have been widely studied owing to their abundance in natural sources. However, challenges, such as identifying specific reactive hydroxy groups and mitigating oligomer formation at active sites, complicate efforts to enhance their biological activity. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and characterized partially capped and nonnatural molecules of C&#8208;glycosidic ellagitannins. A unified synthetic method enabled the incorporation of various functional groups into the open&#8208;chain glucose moiety, yielding a series of analogs based on a common C&#8208;glycosidic ellagitannin core. The antioxidant activities of these analogs were found to depend on their chemical structures. This strategy offers a promising route for the development of ellagitannins with novel functions or enhanced biological activities, thereby addressing the long&#8208;standing challenges in polyphenol research.

         <title>A Simple and Efficient Procedure for the Deoxygenation of Ketones via a Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Vinyl Mesylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient procedure for the deoxygenation of enolizable, activated ketones is reported. Upon activation as the corresponding stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle vinyl mesylates, they are readily reduced to the corresponding alkanes using an especially simple and reusable heterogeneous catalyst, palladium on carbon, under pressure of hydrogen in water, using only 10% of THF as cosolvent. A range of ketones can be readily deoxygenated using this user&#8208;friendly procedure, and its synthetic potential was highlighted in a formal total synthesis of tanikolide.

A simple and efficient procedure for the deoxygenation of enolizable, activated ketones is reported. Upon activation as the corresponding vinyl mesylates, they are readily and easily reduced to the corresponding hydrocarbons using a particularly simple and reusable heterogeneous catalyst, palladium on carbon, under pressure of hydrogen in water, using only 10% of THF as cosolvent. A range of ketones can be readily deoxygenated using this user&#8208;friendly procedure, while its synthetic potential is highlighted in a total synthesis of tanikolide in which the use of this sequence allows performing the removal of a ketone using a considerably shorter sequence compared to a previously reported procedure. As an added bonus, the intermediate vinyl mesylates are shown to be remarkably stable and easy to handle compared to the corresponding tosylates and triflates.

Various unsymmetric bis(heteroaryl) selenides are synthesized by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed exchange reaction of heteroaryl fluorides and ethers with Se&#8208;heteroaryl 1&#8208;adamatanecarboselenoates. The synthetic method is applicable to a broad range of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heteroaryl derivatives and provides compounds containing multiple heteroatoms. It is shown that the Se&#8208;heteroaryl selenoates are excellent heteroarylselenating reagents under rhodium catalysis compared with bis(heteroaryl) diselenides.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Chiral Carbonyl Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric strategies for constructing vicinal &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl bioisosteres are summarized, covering difluoromethylene, gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, and oxetane motifs. The review highlights recent advances in transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, mechanistic insights into stereocontrol, and prospects for bioisostere&#8208;driven drug discovery.

The strategic incorporation of &#945;&#8208;chiral centers into carbonyl bioisosteres is a powerful approach for improving the physicochemical and pharmacological profiles of drug candidates. This review summarizes recent advances in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of vicinal chiral carbonyl bioisosteres, focusing on difluoromethylene, gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, and oxetane motifs. We highlight transition&#8208;metal and organocatalyzed methodologies that achieve high stereocontrol and broad functional group tolerance. Representative examples are analyzed to illustrate key mechanistic pathways, stereochemical models, and applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization. While significant progress has been made, we also discuss persistent challenges regarding generality, efficiency, and mechanistic understanding. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the rational design of catalytic systems and novel molecular scaffolds, thereby accelerating the discovery of high&#8208;performance pharmaceuticals based on chiral bioisosteres.

We report a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyrromethanes using a versatile rhodium&#8208;enalcarbenoid that functions as a 4[C] synthon. This strategy provides direct access to biologically important 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes in excellent yields. The scalability and applicability of the method are demonstrated through a Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the construction of core structures relevant to therapeutic agents.

Herein, we report a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation of diazoenals with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyrromethanes, providing direct access to biologically relevant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes. The transformation proceeds through an in&#8201;situ generated Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoid intermediate that serves as a 4[C] synthon, enabling regioselective C2&#8208;functionalization of the pyrrole ring followed by intramolecular cyclization. This strategy represents the first example of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes synthesis that does not rely on indole precursors. By exploiting the unique reactivity of Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoids, this methodology expands the synthetic toolbox for constructing indole&#8208;based heterocyclic frameworks with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. The synthetic importance of double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation has been demonstrated by the one&#8208;step synthesis of the biologically relevant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methane scaffold.

         <title>A2A Adenosine Receptor Agonists With Last&#8208;Step Enzymatic 18F&#8208;Labelling Potential (Fluorinase) for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study exploits the comparable binding tolerances between the fluorinase enzyme and the A2A adenosine receptor towards the development of novel C&#8208;2 functionalised 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorodeoxy&#8208;adenosine (FDA)&#8208;based agonists with enzymatic 18F&#8208;labelling capability for positron emission tomography (PET).

New agonists of the A2A receptor are reported with 18F&#8208;labelling potential for positron emission tomography (PET). These were designed by exploiting common binding interactions of substrates for the fluorinase and agonists of the human A2A adenosine receptor. Target compounds were structurally inspired by the selective A2A receptor agonist CGS21680. The new agonists were synthesised and their affinities for the human A2A receptor evaluated through radioligand displacement assays. 18F&#8208;Labelled analogues of the new agonists for potential PET radiotracer applications are now accessible through last&#8208;step radiosynthesis using the fluorinase enzyme and [18F]fluoride.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>


Herein we describe our findings dealing with the activation of the Au&#8211;Cl bond in [Au(L)Cl] complexes with several additives. We have probed several additives for their ability to promote the activation of the Au&#8211;Cl bond, in a prototypical cationic Au(I)&#8208;mediated reaction, namely the cyclization/cycloisomerization of propargylamides. Phenol was found to be an efficient additive, successfully promoting the activation of the gold precatalysts, and the progression of the reaction, under mild conditions. Further studies on the reactivity of several substrates and the kinetic profile of the reaction provide valuable insight to the phenol&#8208;mediated activation of Au&#8211;Cl bond and its catalytic competence. Density functional theory calculations provided additional details regarding the effect of the studied additives.

The previously unknown meta&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted aryliodonium salts were prepared by a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthesis from 3&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;1&#8208;[(diacetoxy)iodo]arenes and arylboronic acids. This procedure works well with halogen&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, methoxycarbonyl&#8208;, or methoxy&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids as well as naphthalenylboronic acids, phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;ylboronic acid, and thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylboronic acid. The structure of 3&#8208;hydroxyphenyl(phenyl)iodonium triflate was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Ring Formation in Sesquiterpene Synthesis: Biomimetic vs. Non&#8208;Biomimetic Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short review of cyclase enzyme&#8208;mediated ring formation in sesquiterpene biosynthesis is presented as a prelude to six case studies examining the merits and demerits of biomimetic vs. non&#8208;biomimetic strategies for carbocyclisation in the total synthesis of this iconic natural product class.

Biomimetic synthesis refers to organic synthesis using strategies that mimic biosynthetic pathways to prepare natural products. It draws inspiration from nature's efficiency in constructing organic compounds, often enabling mild conditions and efficient routes. Natural products constitute an enduring source of leads for drug discovery, and this approach has been used to successfully synthesise many medicinally important compounds. The prevalence of topologically complex carbocyclic ring systems in many secondary metabolites and particularly terpenes makes their preparation challenging and highlights the need for increased synthetic efficiency in carbocyclisation reactions. Here, we briefly review recent advances in our understanding of sesquiterpene cyclases and then present six case studies comparing biomimetic vs. non&#8208;biomimetic approaches to the key ring&#8208;forming reactions in this context. Examples have been selected to exemplify some of the classic ring systems that characterise this iconic natural product family.

         <title>Study of Uncatalyzed and Micellar&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Amoxicillin by Colloidal MnO2: Experimental Optimization and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The absorption spectra of amoxicillin degradation by colloidal MnO2 in the presence and absence of surfactants.

Herein, the oxidative degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) by water&#8208;soluble colloidal MnO2 is investigated spectrophotometrically at 298&#8201;K in both uncatalyzed and nonionic micellar&#8208;catalyzed media (Triton X&#8208;100 and Brij&#8208;35). A 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between AMX and MnO2 in acidic medium is observed, and two primary oxidation products are identified and characterized by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry analysis. The reaction exhibits first&#8208;order kinetics with respect to the concentration of AMX in aqueous media, and a fractional&#8208;order dependence in micellar media. Similarly, first&#8208;order and fractional&#8208;order dependences are observed with respect to the concentrations of MnO2 and H2SO4, respectively, in both phases. The effects of experimental parameters, including ionic strength, dielectric constant, and the concentrations of Mn(II), KBr, KCl, and Na2SO4, are thoroughly investigated. Significant catalytic effects are observed for the nonionic surfactants Triton X&#8208;100 and Brij&#8208;35, which are explained using an appropriate mathematical model. A reaction mechanism and corresponding rate law consistent with the experimental data are proposed for both uncatalyzed and micellar&#8208;catalyzed systems, and the thermodynamic activation parameters are evaluated using the Arrhenius equation.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Indole&#8208;Based C&#8211;N Axially Chiral Triarylmethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report the synthesis of C&#8211;N axially chiral and N, N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;aminoindole&#8208;based triarylmethanes via a 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of tosyliminoindoles to p&#8208;quinone methides (PQMs), followed by in situ N&#8208;protection. These triarylmethanes display remarkable C&#8211;N configurational stability, with rotational barriers ranging from 27.5 to 40.9&#8201;kcal/mol, as calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and corroborated by experimental data. The 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition proceeds efficiently in DMF at room temperature in the absence of any base or catalyst. The resulting adducts undergo smooth N&#8208;protection via alkylation, acylation, or sulfonylation under mild basic conditions. This strategy offers convenient access to a structurally diverse library of aminoindole and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol&#8208;derived triarylmethanes, exhibiting C&#8211;N atropisomerism, in good to excellent yields.

Synthesis of C&#8211;N axially chiral and N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;tosylated 2&#8208;aminoindole&#8208;based triarylmethanes via 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of tosyliminoindoles to p&#8208;quinone methides (PQM) followed by in situ N&#8208;protection is reported here. The exceptional C&#8211;N configurational stability, with rotational barriers in the range 27.5&#8211;40.9&#8201;kcal/mol, exhibited by these triarylmethanes, is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and corroborated by experimental evidence. While the 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition takes place in DMF at room temperature under base/catalyst&#8208;free conditions, the diaryliminoindolylmethanes are amenable for in situ N&#8208;protection via alkylation, acylation, and sulfonylation under mild basic conditions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis, Optical, and Photoluminescent Properties of Pyrrolonaphthalimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformations of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide with terminal alkynes were investigated as a facile one&#8208;pot approach to the synthesis of pyrrolonaphthalimides. In this protocol, the cross&#8208;coupling reaction and cyclization were used as a single process. Substituents in the pyrrole ring influence the optical and photoluminescent properties of pyrrolonaphthalimides.

The concise one&#8208;pot synthesis of pyrrolonaphthalimides from 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide and terminal alkynes has been developed. Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformation of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide with alkynes proceeds via the formation of an alkyne substrate, which then undergoes 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization to pyrrolonaphthalimides. The approach demonstrates good tolerance for functional groups. The bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum of the UV&#8211;vis spectrum of the solution of pyrrolo&#8208;NIs in toluene achieved 76&#8201;nm for the pyrrolo&#8208;NI containing 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl moieties. The highest photoluminescence quantum yield (78%) in toluene is observed for the phenyl&#8208;substituted pyrrolo&#8208;NI.

         <title>From Light&#8208;Driven to Dark Synthesis: Streamlining Perfluoroalkyl Selenide Ether Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two orthogonal and user&#8208;friendly protocols enable the efficient construction of (Se/S)&#63743;RF bonds from simple dichalcogenides and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm promotes seleno&#8208; and thioether formation, while a dark KOH/MeCN variant delivers selenoethers in minutes. Both approaches operate under mild, metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, tolerate biologically relevant substrates, and scale smoothly to gram quantities.

Two complementary and operationally simple methods enable the efficient perfluoroalkylation of organodiselenides: (i) direct visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm in aqueous MeCN with RF&#8211;I, requiring no photocatalyst, and (ii) a base&#8208;promoted protocol using KOH in MeCN under dark conditions. Both furnished perfluoroalkyl selenoethers in excellent yields, while only the photoinduced protocol delivered good to excellent yields of perfluoroalkyl thioethers from organodisulfides. The direct irradiation approach also enables the preparation of Se&#8208; and S&#8208;perfluoroalkylated derivatives of selenocysteine and cysteine, highlighting the applicability to biologically relevant substrates. Both protocols feature excellent chemical selectivity, good functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and simple operation. Compared with existing photocatalytic and thermal methods, these approaches provide greater versatility and operational simplicity, exemplified by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a perfluoroalkyl selenoether in excellent yield.

         <title>Fast Nucleophilic Approach to Exhaustively Substituted Porphyrin Derivatives at the &#8220;Eastern Half&#8221;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step procedure including the nitration of simple porphyrinates (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ complexes) and very attractive vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen reaction gives porphyrin derivatives with unique structures, exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half.&#8221; These types of hydrophilic or amphiphilic target products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy. It seems they are practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

meso&#8208;Tetraarylporphyrin chelates (of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) are easily available from parent porphyrins. Their reactions with nitric acid (yellow fuming HNO3, d&#8201;=&#8201;1.52, diluted to 25%&#8211;50%), under optimized conditions in CHCl3 at room temperature, can be carried out selectively, thus giving mainly &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinitro&#8208;substituted moieties (usually two or three isomers of the above complexes). These intermediates (obtained in overall yields of up to 73%), upon the reaction with carbanions bearing a leaving group X at the reactive center, afford the target products, the ones of vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) of hydrogen. This approach allows the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half&#8221;, starting from a simple meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins. These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two&#8208;step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

A mild, cost&#8208;effective, one&#8208;pot, and metal&#8208;free hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated protocol for the production of pyridoquinazolinones from 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;chloropyridines at room temperature has been established. This reported procedure can easily produce biologically active pyridoquinazolinones in a one&#8208;pot manner utilizing readily available starting materials. Operational simplicity, moderate reaction conditions, high atom economy, and high yield are some key features of this protocol. The generation of AcOH and HCl as the only by&#8208;products makes this a cost&#8208;effective procedure for the production of pyridoquinazolinones.
