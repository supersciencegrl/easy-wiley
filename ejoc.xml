         <title>HBTU Mediated Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams from E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams have been found in many biologically active peptide natural products. Due to their biological activities, extensive efforts have been made in the literature to synthesize the Z&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams. Here, we are reporting the spontaneous transformation of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam through in&#8208;situ activation of free carboxylic acid using peptide coupling reagent HBTU and base DIPEA at room temperature. The transformation also involves the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The reaction is also compatible with the peptides consisting of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids at the Cterminus. The Z&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams were isolated in very good yields. Even though the reaction required very mild conditions, the products were isolated in the form of a racemic mixture. However, the products can be separated under a chiral environment. No Z&#8208;lactams were observed if the reaction was performed in the presence of free amines. In addition, no racemization was observed during the peptide synthesis. The analysis of the reactions of various substrates revealed that amide NH and &#947;&#8208;CH are important for lactamization. No &#947;&#8208;lactams or E&#8594;Z isomerization products were observed in the case of N&#8208;Me(E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids, whereas in the case of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;unsaturated &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dimethyl amino acid Z&#8208;lactam was isolated, however, with low yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;Membered Cyclic Peptides Containing N&#8208;Methyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids Utilizing Microflow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids was achieved. This is the first report that describes the synthesis of smaller cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.







Abstract
Smaller cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids have garnered much attention for use as drugs, but their chemical synthesis is extremely challenging. In this study, a rapid (60.5&#8197;min) synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;methyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids was achieved by only switching the concentrations (0.20&#8197;M or 0.01&#8197;M) of the substrates. The developed approach required neither expensive transition&#8208;metals nor expensive coupling agents. As far as we could ascertain, this is the first report of the synthesis of smaller (&#8804;16&#8208;membered) cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.

         <title>A Dual Photoredox and Cp2TiCl2 Catalyzed Approach for the Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, a dual photoredox and titanocene catalyzed methodology for the regioselective access to &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#223;&#8208;hydroxy esters towards aldehyde allylation with 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate is reported. The protocol is based on the Barbier&#8208;type properties of the inexpensive and available Cp2TiCl2 in catalytic amount (5 mol%). The developed mild reaction conditions gave access to a library of differently functionalized &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#223;&#8208;hydroxy&#160;esters in moderate diastereoselectivity, employing the commercially available ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate and both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. The reaction was realized under visible light irradiation, in the presence of an organophotocatalyst (3DPAFIPN, 2 mol%) combined with Hantzsch&#8217;s ester as the sacrificial reductant. In contrast to other Barbier type reactions employing ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate, the photoredox system ensures a better regioselectivity. Moreover, the use of preformed organometallic nucleophilic species (e.g., dienolborinates), and the need of metal reductants or stoichiometric amount of transition metals in low oxidation state for Barbier&#8208;type reactions, is avoided. To support the experimental evidence, a detailed photophysical study shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination of Isonitriles in Water: Urea Synthesis under Biocompatible Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used to track biomolecules in living systems. Due to stringent requirements of physiological conditions, enriching the toolkit of bioorthogonal reactions remains the most important and challenging issue. Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second&#8208;order reaction rate constant (k2) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A dioxygen&#8208;triggered selectively difunctionalization of olefins to achieve &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfones has been developed. Particularly, the mechanism of this reaction can be controlled by DABCO, which act as a single electron transfer reagent, to selectively obtain ketosulfone or hydroxysulfone. The reaction was conducted in a clean, safe, mild, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two bioactive molecules were synthesized easily using this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)/Lewis Acid Catalyzed Intramolecular Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination to Construct Carbazoles with Dioxygen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II)/LA catalyst was explored for intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles with O2 as the sole oxidant. The mechanistic studies supported that the C&#8722;H activation by Pd(II) was a reversible step and the palladacycle intermediate was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H amination reactions are among the most attractive topics in organic synthesis to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs. The challenge is that most of these reactions employed stoichiometric oxidants to achieve satisfied catalytic efficiencies. Herein, we report a Pd(II)/LA&#8208;catalyzed (LA: Lewis acid) oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles by using dioxygen balloon as the sole oxidant source, and the presence of LA sharply improved the catalytic efficiency of Pd(OAc)2. Remarkably, in certain cases, the deacetylation of the annulation product happened under standard conditions to afford free carbazoles as the final product. The H/D exchange studies confirmed the reversibility of C&#8722;H activation and also disclosed multiple C&#8722;H activation sites by using &#8722;NAc and &#8722;NTs as the directing groups. In addition, the palladacycle compound was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations and proved to be the intermediate prior to the carbazole formation.

         <title>Lateral Deprotometallation&#8208;Trapping Reactions on Methylated Pyridines, Quinolines and Quinoxalines Using Lithium Diethylamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The behavior of methylated heterocycles (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline) in deprotometallation&#8208;trapping sequences using lithium diethylamide was studied.







Abstract
The functionalization of methylated azines and diazines has aroused the interest of chemists given the structural diversity that it affords. Hindered lithium dialkylamides have been used to deprotometallate these substrates chemoselectively. In contrast, it can be observed that, despite some promising work, lithium diethylamide has been used very little for this purpose. Our objective here is on the one hand to make an inventory of what reagents have been used to deprotometallate methylpyridines, &#8208;quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines, and on the other hand to describe the results obtained by seeking to functionalize a series of substrates with lithium diethylamide (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline). Our efforts to take advantage of the use of an in&#8208;situ trap (a zinc chloride chelate) in these reactions are also described.

         <title>Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids and Its Applications in C&#8208;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile methodology for the transformation of arylboronic acids into phenols through NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. The reaction involves the transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH, facilitating the direct derivatization of the resulting ArONa into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides. This approach offers a straightforward and efficient route to diversify the synthesized compounds.







Abstract
We have developed a straightforward methodology for converting arylboronic acids into phenols using NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. This reaction offers several advantages, including simple operation, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability. The transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH occurs readily, enabling convenient derivatization of the borate ester into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical protocol for a practical and direct method for the electron&#8208;deficient C(sp2)&#8722;H Ritter&#8208;type amination under mild conditions was developed. This method is characterized by inexpensive and easily accessible regents, atom and step economy. With moderate to good yields, this useful and simple process produces a number of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted arenes.







Abstract
Due to the high oxidation potentials of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic hydrocarbons, it is difficult to achieve the direct oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds functionalizations of such substrates. Herein, we develop a Ritter&#8208;type amination of electron&#8208;deficient aromatics by merging electricity and sulfate. This practical and straightforward method provides a series of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted arenes (22&#8197;examples, up to 75&#8201;%) with moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This method is characterized by cheap and readily available regents, atom and step economy.

         <title>Quantifying the Electronic Effect of C4 and C4&#8242; Positions of Bipyridine Ligand on Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition Reaction: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study screens a parameter Mayer bond order which can quantitatively describe the electronic effects of 4 and 4&#8242; positions on each side of the bipyridine ligands for activation energy barrier of insertion step in Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. The dominant &#963;&#8208;donation of ligand to Pd(II) and the dominant &#8220;&#960;&#8208;back donation&#8221; of Rh(I) to ligand are the main reason for the opposite trends of correlation between the activation energy barrier with Mayer bond order on the ligand&#8208;Pd(II)/Rh(I).







Abstract
The electronic effects of the bidentate ligands play a vital role in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. Here, the insertion step (rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the conjugate addition) catalyzed by Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;complexes with 26&#8197;bipyridine&#8208;type (bpy) ligands linking different substituent groups in the opposite sides (C4, C4&#8242; position) are systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that for both Pd(II)&#8208; and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing group connecting to both C4 and C4&#8242; positions of bpy ligands can promote the insertion step. The predominance of &#960;&#8208;back donation in Rh(I) and &#963;&#8208;donation in Pd(II) is the main reason for above different electronic properties of Pd(II) and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis. This work gives enough theoretical guide to the rational design of the efficient transition metal&#8208;based catalyst for conjugate addition.

         <title>C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Thiols Mediated by Gold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold mediated C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling of aryldiazonium salts with thiols is described. The relevance of the protocol is the use of the readily available and simple gold complex Me2SAuCl. The reaction proceeds under soft conditions and has a broad scope in both the diazonium salt and the thiol.







Abstract
In this work, the coupling of aryldiazonium salts with thiols mediated by the readily accessible gold complex Me2SAuCl is described. In the reported protocol, the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a ligand leads to higher yields than phosphines. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under soft mildconditions and has a broad scope in both the aryldiazonium salt and the thiol. Notably, the coupling works with aryldiazonium salts containing two additional substituents.

         <title>Kinetic and Product Study of the S&#8208;oxidation vs HAT Chemoselectivity in Reactions Promoted by Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;oxo Complex/NHPI Mediator System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidations of aryl sulfides, alkylaromatics and benzylic alcohols promoted by the nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ either alone or in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediator indicate a general preference for the S&#8208;oxidation in the absence of the mediator while hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is favored in the reactions promoted by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radical deriving from NHPI oxidation by [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+.







Abstract
The chemoselectivity between S&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from C&#8722;H bonds has been investigated in the oxidations of a series of aryl sulfides, alkyl aromatic compounds and benzylic alcohols promoted by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ (N4Py: N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;methylamine) either alone or in the presence of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediator via kinetic and product studies. Kinetic analyses indicate a generally higher reactivity of [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ for S&#8208;oxidation process while HAT is favored in the reactions promoted by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radical (PINO) deriving from NHPI oxidation. Product analysis in intermolecular competitive oxidations confirms the kinetic results with sulfoxides obtained as major products in the oxidation promoted by [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+. Conversely, when NHPI is employed as a mediator, significant differences in terms of chemoselectivity are observed, and HAT&#8208;derived products are obtained in higher yields which translate into an inversion of selectivity in the case of the substrates containing activated C&#8722;H bonds like diphenylmethane, triphenylmethane and benzylic alcohols. A similar change of chemoselectivity is also observed in the oxidation of aromatic substrates containing both a sulfur atom and &#945; to OH benzylic C&#8722;H bonds, with the sulfoxide product more abundant in the absence of NHPI and carbonyl products prevailing with the [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+/NHPI system.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free and NBS&#8208;Mediated Direct Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange Reaction to Access Unsymmetrical Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel NBS&#8208;mediated direct thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction has been described for the construction of various unsymmetrical disulfides at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions. More than 30&#8197;examples of unsymmetrical disulfides were isolated in good yields (up to 93&#8201;%). Captopril, an angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme inhibitor, was able to form the corresponding unsymmetrical disulfide in 61&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free and N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS)&#8208;mediated direct thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction at room temperature is developed. A variety of unsymmetrical disulfides have been prepared with good to excellent yields. Efficient late&#8208;stage modification of amino acids and drugs demonstrates the utility of this strategy. In addition, easy to operate, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance further demonstrate that this reaction provides an essential complementary route to access unsymmetrical disulfides.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;Alkenylation of Isoquinolones with Maleimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective olefination of N&#8208;protected isoquinolones at C8&#8208;position has been achieved under rhodium catalysis. A range of maleimides were employed to obtain the olefinated products in moderate to excellent yield with excellent selectivity. Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) study and Hammett plot analysis were also performed to understand the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;protected isoquinolone with maleimides is reported. The carbonyl group of isoquinolone acts as an inherent directing group. Various N&#8208;substituents in the maleimide, including alkyl, aryl, and even H and &#8722;OH, were well tolerated under the developed reaction condition. This protocol showed broad substrate scope, good selectivity, and excellent yields. Hammett plot is also drawn to check the effect of substituents on the reaction progress.

         <title>Porous Organic Salts Composed of Terphenyl Sulfonic Acid and Their Bottleneck Designability</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) are constructed through a strong charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond, and the molecular design of the sulfonic acid used enables access to various porous structures. The current work establishes a precise design methodology for POSs with high crystallinity and a one&#8208;dimensional pore in metal&#8208;free porous organic materials, which allows further functionalization of POSs.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are constructed through a strong charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond between sulfonic and amino groups. The molecular design of sulfonic acid, the linker part, enables various porous structures. In the current work, we synthesized p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;disulfonic acid (TPDS), whose molecular structure can be easily modified by organic synthesis. Combining of TPDS and bulky tri&#8208;p&#8208;tolylmethanamine (TPMA&#8208;Me), which has three methyl groups at each para&#8208;position of the phenyl groups of triphenylmethylamine (TPMA), gave POS with one&#8208;dimensional pore channels having two different types of bottlenecks. The central benzene ring of TPDS is exposed on the surface of the pore. Therefore, we combined 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzenesulfonic acid (BTDBS) containing 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT) with TPMA&#8208;Me, and successfully constructed a one&#8208;dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck of 3.5&#8197;&#197;, by exposing BT to the surface of the pore. BTDBS/TPMA&#8208;Me exhibited a large adsorption/desorption hysteresis of nitrogen because of the bottleneck, electronic state of BT, and larger oxygen adsorption than the isostructural TPDS/TPMA&#8208;Me. Systematic and intended modulation of the pore structure of POS based on the modification of sulfonic acid was demonstrated, and for the first time, we established a precise design methodology for a one&#8208;dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck and high crystallinity in metal&#8208;free porous organic materials.

In the current work, we synthesized &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl-4,4&#8217;&#8217;-disulfonic acid (TPDS), whose molecular structure can be easily modified by organic synthesis. Combining of TPDS and bulky tri-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolylmethanamine (TPMA-Me), which has three methyl groups at each &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-position of the phenyl groups of triphenylmethylamine (TPMA), gave POS with one-dimensional pore channels having two different types of bottlenecks. The central benzene ring of TPDS is exposed on the surface of the pore. Therefore, we combined 4,4&#8242;-(benzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)dibenzenesulfonic acid (BTDBS) containing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with TPMA-Me, and successfully constructed a one-dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck of 3.5&#8197;&#197;, by exposing BT to the surface of the pore. BTDBS/TPMA-Me exhibited a large adsorption/desorption hysteresis of nitrogen because of the bottleneck, electronic state of BT, and larger oxygen adsorption than the isostructural TPDS/TPMA-Me. Systematic and intended modulation of the pore structure of POS based on the modification of sulfonic acid was demonstrated, and for the first time, we established a precise design methodology for a one-dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck and high crystallinity in metal-free porous organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Halogen Atom Transfer to Access Polyhalogenated and Deuterated Lactams from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy for the synthesis of polyhalogenated and deuterated &#948;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;lactams from readily available alkyl halides has been developed. The reaction utilizes halogen atom transfer to generate a variety of fluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and deuterated haloalkyl radicals that initiate a cascade addition&#8208;cyclization process with N&#8208;allyl benzamides to afford 5&#8208;membered and 6&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
A visible light mediated protocol for the synthesis of polyhalogenated and deuterated &#948;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;lactams from readily available alkyl halides is reported. The reaction involves the generation of haloalkyl radicals through halogen atom transfer (XAT) and subsequent arylalkylation of olefins to afford dihydroisoquinolinones and oxindoles. This new XAT protocol exhibits wide scope under mild conditions and enables access to new halogenated chemical space.

         <title>CO2 Hydroboration: Impact of the Boryl Moieties on the Reactivity of Four Bis(boryl)acetal Compounds toward 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylaniline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four bis(boryl)acetal compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were synthesized under identical conditions. Mechanistic investigations proved that their condensation toward 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline is very sensitive to the steric hindrance of the boryl moieties.







Abstract
The hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) compounds is an important transformation, since it enabled to selectively reduce CO2 by 4e&#8208; and to subsequently use the BBA compounds as C1 and Cn sources. However, the influence of the nature of the boryl moieties on the reactivity of BBA compounds has not been evaluated so far. In the present study, four BBA compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were reacted with 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline to afford the expected imine. Significant differences in the rate of the reaction from minutes to weeks have been observed depending on the BBA used, showing the importance of the nature of the boryl moieties. Theoretical investigations enabled to propose a mechanism involving the addition of the aniline to the BBA as the rate&#8208;determining step and to determine that the steric hindrance of the BBA compounds is the main factor driving the rate of this condensation reaction.

         <title>Influence of Substitution on the Supramolecular Chemistry of Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a detailed host&#8208;guest study of [10]cycloparaphenylene and three substituted analogues with the fullerenes C60 and C70 is presented. Fluorescence quenching experiments as well as computational chemistry were employed in order to shine light on the influence of substitution on the association behavior. An increased steric demand was facing additional attractive interactions between substituents and the fullerene itself.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive host&#8208;guest study of four substituted and unsubstituted [10]cycloparaphenylenes with the fullerenes C60 and C70. Within this study, the influence on the complexation behavior was investigated experimentally and computationally. Due to the increased steric demand the substitution on the nanohoop results in an energetic penalty, which could be partially compensated by additional substituent&#8208;fullerene interactions. These attractive interactions are intensified in the C70 complexes and with an increased degree of substitution. For the computational investigation conformer ensembles were taken into account, providing reliable structures with Boltzmann weighted energies. An analysis of the noncovalent interactions elucidated the origin of the enhanced substituent&#8208;C70 interaction. The ellipsoid fullerene C70 can be considered as a &#960;&#8208;extended version of C60, which is able to increase the attractive van der Waals interactions within these supramolecular complexes.

Abstract
We described here a simple and metal&#8208;free protocol to synthesize [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides through a two&#8208;step synthetic strategy, in which the first step uses organocatalysis (10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of diethylamine or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, while the second step involves the use of inorganic base (1.2 or 0.1&#8197;equiv. of potassium hydroxide). These reactions were performed between &#946;&#8208;keto amides and o&#8208;carbonyl phenylazides in dimethylsulfoxide as solvent at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The synthetic protocol is ample, which thirteen examples of secondary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides were synthesized ranging from good to excellent yields (63&#8208;96&#8201;%), and six different tertiary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines 3&#8208;carboxamides were obtained ranging from moderate to good yields (48&#8211;76&#8201;%).

         <title>Front Cover: Porous Organic Salts Composed of Terphenyl Sulfonic Acid and Their Bottleneck Designability (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 30/2023)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the porous organic salt with &#8220;gate&#8208;like&#8221; bottlenecks that exhibits gas separation properties depending on the size of the bottlenecks. Oxygen molecules (shown in red) are smaller than the gate size and can easily get in and out. In contrast, nitrogen molecules (shown in blue) are larger than the gate size and can hardly get in and out. Modulation of the gate size will be one of the triggers of future gas separation (e.g., air, toxics, fuel gas). The cover picture was created by Kouki Oka.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Front Cover&lt;/b&gt; shows the porous organic salt with &#8220;gate-like&#8221; bottlenecks that exhibits gas separation properties depending on the size of the bottlenecks. Oxygen molecules (shown in red) are smaller than the gate size and can easily get in and out. In contrast, nitrogen molecules (shown in blue) are larger than the gate size and can hardly get in and out. Modulation of the gate size will be one of the triggers of future gas separation (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., air, toxics, fuel gas). The cover picture was created by Kouki Oka.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridine and Quinoline Scaffolds by Using Organometallic Li&#8208;, Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208;Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 30, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different approaches to functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds are covered in this review, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Sensitive maybe broad functional group tolerance, moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, and inexpensive and low&#8208;hazardous chemicals were used to highly functionalize pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive pharmaceutical scaffolds and natural products.







Abstract
This Review discusses the various methods for functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Selective deprotonation of aryl or pyridyl/quinolinyl derivatives can be performed using n&#8208;BuLi, LDA, and TMP&#8208;based different organolithium, &#8208;magnesium, and &#8208;zinc reagents. The functionalized pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based heterocyclic compounds were prepared by selectively deprotonating with presenting a directing functional group substituted pyridine/quinoline analogues in the presence of TMP&#8208;bases (TMP&#8722;Li, Mg, Zn reagents). Different aryl or alkyl Li, Mg, and Zn reagents with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions with pyridine/quinoline halides under mild conditions with the sustainable process producing complex N&#8208;heterocycles. Using moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, sensitive functional group tolerance, and inexpensive and low toxic chemicals, highly functionalization of pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive therapeutic scaffolds and natural products was accomplished. Therefore, in this article, we provide a succinct overview of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods used by various authors between 2010 and 2023 to functionalize pyridine and quinoline analogues using diverse Li, Mg, and Zn organometallic reagents.

         <title>Multienzymatic Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactam Building Blocks from Unsaturated Esters and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of enzymatic cascades and multi&#8208;step reaction sequences represents an attractive alternative to traditional synthetic&#8208;organic approaches. The biocatalytic reaction mediators offer not only mild conditions and permit the use of environmentally benign reagents, but the high compatibility of different enzymes promises more streamlined reaction setups. In this study, a triple&#8208;enzymatic strategy was developed that enables the direct conversion of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters to N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactame building blocks. Hereby, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylaminolysis generates hydroxamic acid intermediates that are subsequently aerobically activated by horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase to cyclize in an intramolecular nitroso ene reaction. Utilizing the hydroxyl&#173;aminolysis/ene&#8208;cyclization sequence for the preparation of an aza&#8208;spirocyclic lactam, the multi&#8208;enzymatic methodology was successfully employed in the synthesis of key intermediates en route to alkaloids of the Cephalotaxus family.</dc:description>

         <title>Diols Speed Up Guanidine Base Catalyzed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt Condensation to Produce New 15&#8208;Arylidene Steroids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diols are efficient co&#8208;catalysts in guanidine catalysed condensation of ketones and aldehydes. According to quantum chemical calculations the acceleration effect can be explained by the formation of complexes of carbonyl compounds and diols held together by double H&#8208;bonding. The base/diol mixture can be separated from the product and recycled by reversible CO2 capture and release.







Abstract
Considerable acceleration was observed in the guanidine&#8208;base catalysed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and a 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;5&#945;,13&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;16&#8208;one (1) in the presence of ethylene glycol. Rate&#8208;enhancement effects of various alcohols and diols were compared. In quantum chemical calculations, coordination of the carbonyl group of the substrate was found to reduce the potential barrier to the proton transfer from the &#945; carbon and thus facilitate the formation of the anion that attacks the aldehyde. Both the experiments and the calculations showed that diols enhance the reactivity more efficiently than alcohols. Ethylene glycol/guanidine&#8208;base mixtures were found to be efficient catalysts and solvents in the synthesis of a range of new 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;13&#945;&#8208;15&#8208;arylidene steroids. This solvent mixture has a further advantage: the crude products can be isolated by simple extraction after introduction of CO2. It is also shown that by the proper choice of the base, the base/diol mixture can be recycled.

         <title>Investigations into the Aqueous Synthesis of Selenoglycoconjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the direct conjugation of unprotected glycosyl diselenides with various biomolecules, including resorcinol, resveratrol, as well as the antitumor agent gimeracil, is reported. The Se&#8208;aglycon could be oxidatively cleaved from the sugar, priming these molecules for targeted cancer therapy. The generality and broad substrate scope of this novel procedure will also allow access to various selenium&#8208;containing glycomimetics and glycoconjugates.







Abstract
Glycosylation of bioactive molecules has been found to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the parent molecule. However, their syntheses often require tedious protecting group manipulations. The development of methodologies which allow direct aqueous conversion of unprotected sugars into glycosides is therefore an ambitious goal. Herein, we present a broadly applicable method for the synthesis of selenoglycosides in water. We show the ease of direct conjugation of unprotected glycosyl diselenides with various biomolecules, including resorcinol, resveratrol, and the antitumor agent, gimeracil, furnishing the corresponding selenoglycoconjugates in up to 96&#8201;% yield. We also demonstrate the oxidatively&#8208;triggered release of the bioactive drug from the sugar, priming these molecules for medicinal applications. The generality and broad substrate scope of this novel transformation will provide access to various selenium&#8208;containing glycomimetics and glycoconjugates.

         <title>Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Heck Alkenylation of Cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethanol with Alkenyl Triflates and Evaluation of Noncovalent Effects</title>

         <dc:description>
The enantio and diastereoselective synthesis of vinyl cyclopentenols by a Heck reaction was accomplished. It features the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands, and a delicate balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cationic palladium complex with the nucleophilic oxygen group of the substrates. VCD played a critical role to establish the relative and the absolute stereochemistry of the Heck products.







Abstract
This work describes an effective method to obtain chiral vinyl cyclopentenols with a high degree of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity through Heck desymmetrization of cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethanol using vinyl triflates as coupling agents and chiral N,N ligands. This Heck vinylation protocol allowed the synthesis of several structurally complex cyclopentenols in isolated yields of up to 80&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios of up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 and diastereoselectivities higher than 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 in most cases. Experiments using (E) or (Z) vinyl triflates, and desymmetrization of protected olefin 1&#8208;(cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrobenzene (17) were instrumental in rationalizing the observed diastereoselectivities of Heck products involving the interaction of vinyl triflate carbonyl and the hydroxyl group moiety of the substrate with the cationic Pd(II) complex. The absolute configuration of the vinylated Heck products was determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure Amino Alcohols from Simple Methyl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination, followed by a hydrolysis and an enantioselective biocatalytic synthesis yields valuable chiral amino alcohols (phenylglycinol derivatives) with excellent enantiomeric excesses. The presence of an extensive keto&#8208;enol&#8208;tautomerism even expands the range of amino alcohol products.







Abstract
This study highlights the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from simple and readily available aromatic methyl ketones. Starting from acetophenone derivatives, the straight&#8208;forward synthesis strategy involved an initial bromination of the alpha&#8208;positioned methyl group in the first step, followed by a simple hydrolysis to the hydroxyketone (2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone). The hydroxylated intermediate was subsequently converted from Silicibacter pomeroyi to the final 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol by using the transaminase. The transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeded with yields up to 62&#8201;% and always excellent enantiomeric excess of &gt;99&#8201;%. Interestingly, the keto&#8208;enol&#8208;tautomerism of the hydroxyl ketone yields an unexpected amino alcohol isomer.

&lt;p&gt;A site-selective bromination, followed by a hydrolysis and an enantioselective biocatalytic synthesis yields valuable chiral amino alcohols (phenylglycinol derivatives) with excellent enantiomeric excesses. The presence of an extensive keto-enol-tautomerism even expands the range of amino alcohol products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the straight-forward synthesis of substituted 1,2-amino alcohols from simple and readily available aromatic methyl ketones. Starting from acetophenone derivatives, the straight-forward synthesis strategy involved an initial bromination of the alpha-positioned methyl group in the first step, followed by a simple hydrolysis to the hydroxyketone (2-hydroxyacetophenone). The hydroxylated intermediate was subsequently converted from &lt;i&gt;Silicibacter pomeroyi&lt;/i&gt; to the final 1,2-amino alcohol by using the transaminase. The transaminase-catalyzed reaction proceeded with yields up to 62&#8201;% and always excellent enantiomeric excess of &amp;gt;99&#8201;%. Interestingly, the keto-enol-tautomerism of the hydroxyl ketone yields an unexpected amino alcohol isomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with iodonium ylides leading to pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazole derivatives has been developed. This reaction is highly efficient over the traditional methods in terms of stable and non&#8208;explosive carbene precursors, simple and oxidant free operation, satisfactory functional group tolerance, and atom and step economy.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with iodonium ylides proceed efficiently. For the first time, the easily available iodonium ylides and inexpensive ruthenium complex were employed to synthesize pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazole derivatives in good yields under simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;operate conditions. Several primary mechanism investigations and synthetic applications involving gram&#8208;scale preparation, derivatization reactions and the transformation of iodonium ylide generated in&#8197;situ have also been conducted.

         <title>Fluorinated Analogues to the Pentuloses of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows fluorinated analogues to rare sugars, which facilitate close&#8208;up views on important biochemical pathways and can allow the identification of short&#8208;lived intermediates or formerly unknown mechanistic details. They are useful tools to study individual enzymatic transformations and whole metabolic pathways such as the pentose&#8208;phosphate&#8208;pathway in vitro and in vivo. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Pallitsch et&#8197;al.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their high lipophilicity and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property, more and more attention has been paid to introducing trifluoromethylseleno and fluoroalkylseleno moieties into organic molecules. In this short review, we categorize the synthesis of compounds that combine selenium and fluorinated moieties into two main types: trifluoromethylselenolation (CF3Se) and fluoroalkylselenolation (RfSe except CF3Se). This review aims to provide a summary of the recent advances in direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation from the synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation reagents to their application. Based on the method of how the RfSe group was introduced, the main content is divided into three parts: transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated/catalyzed reactions and photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The general substrate scope, mechanism and limitations would also be discussed so that we hope the review will serve as an inspiration for further research in this appealing research field.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Cyclobutene&#8208;Annulated Fullerenes Through a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The physicochemical properties of fullerene&#8208;based materials typically vary depending on the type and mode of addition of functional groups; therefore, developing fullerene derivatives with novel structures is imperative for further progress in materials science. In this study, we develop an efficient one&#8208;step strategy for synthesizing cyclobutene&#8208;annulated fullerene derivatives (cyclobutenofullerenes) and characterize their electronic properties. Despite the steric strain, cyclobutenofullerenes can be easily prepared via a one&#8208;step reaction of C60 with a secondary propargylic phosphate. Structural analysis of the reaction intermediates suggests that the cascade reaction proceeds through a formal [2 + 2] cycloaddition of C60 with an allene, caused by the 1,3&#8208;migration of the propargylic phosphate, followed by an additional 1,3&#8208;migration and the subsequent 1,2&#8208;elimination of the phosphodiester moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Communication Through the Eyes of Synthetic Organic Chemists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up fabrication of synthetic cells (protocells) from molecules and materials, is a major challenge of modern chemistry. A significant breakthrough has been the engineering of protocells capable of chemical communication using&#160;bio&#8208;derived&#160;natural&#160;molecules and&#160;ex situ&#160;stabilised cell machineries. These, however, suffer from short shelf&#8208;lives, high costs, and require mild aqueous conditions. In this Concept Article we analyse the chemistry at the heart of protocell communication to highlight new opportunities for synthetic chemists in protocell engineering. Specifically, we (i) categorise the main bio&#8208;derived chemical communication machineries in enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated communication; (ii) review the chemistries of these signal transduction machineries; and (iii) introduce new types of bio&#8208;inspired, fully synthetic artificial enzymes to replace their natural counterparts. Developing protocells that incorporate synthetic analogues of bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries will improve the robustness, stability and versatility of protocells, and broaden their applications to highly strategic fields such as photocatalysis and fine chemicals production.</dc:description>

Here reports an synthetic method to access polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyridine, by palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative annulation of 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one with alkenes using benzimidazole as directing group. In addition, their photophysical properties have been well elucidated with improved quantum yields.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] oxidative annulation of coumarin&#8208;benzimidazoles with olefins for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been achieved. This synthetic protocol gives access to a wide range of structurally distinct imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyridines in moderate to good yield with wide functional group tolerance. Further, photophysical properties of annulated scaffolds have been examined, which discloses their interesting solvatochromic emission behaviors.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the facile access of isoindolone spirosuccinimides has been developed through N,O&#8208;directing group&#8208;assisted, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of benzamides. Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H bond functionalization of benzamides with maleimides was developed for the facile access to isoindolone spirosuccinimides in good to excellent yields. This C&#8722;H bond activation and spirocyclization employing pyridine N&#8208;oxide as directing group provided very good substrate scope and tolerated various functional groups. Furthermore, the mechanistic investigation revealed that the C&#8722;H bond activation is the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dihydropyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one (DHPI) scaffold is present in a range of biologically active small molecules. Focusing on the development of a transition metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylation of the 1H&#8208;indole core to furnish a C2&#8722;C3&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;lactam ring system, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy that permits access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted DHPIs is showcased.







Abstract
Present in a number of small molecule derivatives that display a wide range of biological activities, the dihydropyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;(2H)&#8208;one (DHPI) core represents an underexplored heterocyclic scaffold. Given the pharmaceutical potential of the DHPI motif, the development of synthetic methodologies that permit their expedient assembly would be highly desirable. Herein, we describe a novel strategy for the construction of the DHPI core from 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;1H&#8208;indolyl substrates, employing an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylative ring closure.

     alt="Accessing Dihydropyrrolo[3,4-b]indol-1(2H)-ones via Pd-Catalyzed Intramolecular Aminocarbonylative Ring Closure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dihydropyrrolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indol-1(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (DHPI) scaffold is present in a range of biologically active small molecules. Focusing on the development of a transition metal-catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylation of the 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indole core to furnish a C2&#8722;C3-fused &#947;-lactam ring system, a Pd-catalyzed annulation strategy that permits access to 2,4-disubstituted DHPIs is showcased.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present in a number of small molecule derivatives that display a wide range of biological activities, the dihydropyrrolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indol-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (DHPI) core represents an underexplored heterocyclic scaffold. Given the pharmaceutical potential of the DHPI motif, the development of synthetic methodologies that permit their expedient assembly would be highly desirable. Herein, we describe a novel strategy for the construction of the DHPI core from 3-iodo-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indolyl substrates, employing an unprecedented Pd-catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylative ring closure. The compatibility of our optimized protocol with various functional groups is highlighted through the synthesis of a range of diversely substituted DHPI derivatives in up to 90&#8201;% isolated yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Self&#8208;Filling Effects of Branched Isopropyl Groups on the Conformational and Supramolecular Properties of Isopropoxyprism[6]arene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Here is reported the direct macrocyclization of a prism[6]arene macrocycle bearing branched alkyl chains on the rims. Isopropoxyprism[6]arene adopts in solution and in the solid state a cuboid D2&#8208;conformation in which four isopropyl groups are folded inside the cavity, to give C&#8210;H&#183;&#183;&#183;p interactions and filling the internal void. The conformational features of isopropoxyprism[6]arene have been studied by dynamic 1H NMR experiments. The presence of branched isopropyl chains on the prism[6]arene rims, stabilizes the cuboid D2&#8208;conformation to a greater extent than ethyl or propyl groups in PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr. The higher resistence of PrS[6]iPr&#160;to open its cuboid D2 conformation, with respect to&#160; PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr, also affected its binding abilities. In fact, alkylammonium&#8208;based endo&#8208;cavity complexes of PrS[6]iPr show lower binding constant values than the analogous propoxy/ethoxy&#8208;prism[6]arene complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyramidalization at the sp2&#8208;Hybridized ipso&#8208;Carbon Atom of Phenyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we investigate the pyramidalization of the sp2 center at the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of phenyl compounds on the theoretical side by DFT calculations of toluene, t&#8208;butylbenzene, and ethylbenzene and on the experimental side by a scatter plot analysis of 14,169 structures of ethylbenzene compounds C&#946;&#8208;C&#945;H2&#8208;C6H5 with three open positions for variation at C&#946;, accumulated in the Cambridge Structural Database. In a 360o rotation about the bond between C&#945; of the substituent and the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of the phenyl ring, the pyramidalization performs three maxima and minima. A comparison of structures with pyramidalization and its hypothetical counterparts without pyramidalization shows that pyramidalization is associated with a gain of energy. The data reveal that it is the carbon atom C&#945; of the phenyl substituent, which on pyramidalization bends away from the phenyl plane. Pyramidalization of sp2 centers is an omnipresent member in the bunch of weak interactions in molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A mild electrochemical oxidative cyclization for the synthesis of flavones from easy&#8208;access 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones was developed using an inexpensive NaI as mediator and electrolyte under ambient temperature in a mixture of EtOH and H2O as solvent. This method was successfully applied to synthesize 26 examples of flavones from a variety of functionalized 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones. A gram&#8208;scale formal synthesis of bioactive scutellarein was successfully demonstrated. The main advantages of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent, and no requirement for strong oxidizing agents and external additives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination, a coupling reaction between a carbonyl component and a sulfone partner, has been emerged as a powerful synthetic tool in the preparation of several organic compounds. A number of interesting examples involving particularly the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes along with important observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions have been recently reported. This reviewing work covers the literature for the period 2016&#8208;2022 and describes in a comprehensive way the progress and developments of Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination application in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Congested Bis&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Porphyrin Containing a Single Buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne Linkage: From a Serendipitous Finding to Supramolecular Encapsulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zinc&#8208;porphyrin moieties have been covalently attached through a single, rigid buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho position of a meso phenyl ring. Despite of freely rotating around the bis&#8208;alkyne axle, such species is adaptable enough to encapsulate a DABCO molecule with a high association constant (K&gt;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) as supported by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A unique example of a bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin chemical system in which both macrocycles are covalently connected with a single, short buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho sites of the meso phenyl rings is presented. This dimeric compound resulted from an homo&#8208;coupling side&#8208;reaction taking place during a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between an alkyne porphyrin and 2&#8208;azidopyridine derivatives. Its unexpected formation was rationalized by control experiments and an improved synthesis was achieved under copper&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling reaction conditions. This highly sterically congested bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin derivative behaved as a supramolecular host for encapsulating ditopic molecular guests such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with association constant K1.1 in the order of 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. This value is comparable to current systems that typically feature several connecting linkages between the two zinc&#8208;porphyrin sites resulting in (supra)molecular cages ensuring a high pre&#8208;organization. As such, the requirements to take benefit from supramolecular encapsulation can be reduced to a highly rigid, minimal covalent linkage of four atoms between zinc&#8208;porphyrins as herein described.

         <title>Alternative Functionalization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. This work describes an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. One effective strategy demonstrated to improve the performance and morphology of organic solar cells is incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonding units into DPPs. While the functionalization of the DPP lactams and the coupling of aromatic units to the thiophene rings are the most common procedures to tune the properties of such derivatives, modifying the thiophene capping units with hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups is a challenging synthetic task. Despite this difficulty, incorporating amide&#8208;containing substituents into the thiophene rings of single core thiophene&#8208;capped DPP derivatives could yield exciting results, as the advantages of having hydrogen&#8208;bonded &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems based on these modified DPPs have not been explored thoroughly. This work reports on an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Double C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines with 3&#8208;Chloropropiophenones: Selective Access to 2,3,6&#8208;Trisubstituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient de novo access to 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines was successfully synthesized through a mono&#8208; or dialkylation reaction between 4/3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones using DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cheap cooperative basic system and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization in the presence of NH4OAc under an air.







Abstract
An efficient sequential one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step pseudo&#8208;four&#8208;component reaction between 3/4&#8208;methyl N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones triggered by DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cooperative base and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization using NH4OAc is reported. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free technique concocts new C&#8722;C/C=C/C=N&#8722;C bonds selectively, guaranteeing acceptable yields of 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines possessing ortho&#8208;hydroxyaryl/benzenesulfonamide and propiophenone moieties at C2 and C3 positions, respectively. Interestingly, while replacing methyl&#8208;substituents with straight alkyl chains of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, only a monoalkylation reaction happened with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated vinyl ketones to deliver promising yields of 3&#8208;picoline derivatives. Moreover, the synthetic transmutation of prepared pyridine derivative led to several important classes of pyridocoumarin, 5H&#8208;chromenopyridine, and di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl) methane derivatives.

         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;triones, which are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions, unstable dianions, and long&#8208;lived 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one radical dianions, followed by the formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantene&#8208;9&#8208;ones as the final products.







Abstract
A convenient synthetic route was proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione. This compound and its 3&#8208;H congener are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, which can be used as building blocks for materials used in organic electronics. Electrochemical reduction (ECR) of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione and its 3&#8208;methyl derivative in DMF and acetonitrile is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions and unstable dianions at the first and second stages, respectively. In a protolytic equilibrium, dianions are converted into 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one anions.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene-1,4,9-triones, which are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone-like heterocycles, is a three-stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long-lived radical anions, unstable dianions, and long-lived 1-oxy-4-hydroxy-1H-thioxanthene-9-one radical dianions, followed by the formation of 1,4-dihydroxy-1H-thioxantene-9-ones as the final products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convenient synthetic route was proposed for the synthesis of 3-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene-1,4,9-trione. This compound and its 3-H congener are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone-like heterocycles, which can be used as building blocks for materials used in organic electronics. Electrochemical reduction (ECR) of 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene-1,4,9-trione and its 3-methyl derivative in DMF and acetonitrile is a three-stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long-lived radical anions and unstable dianions at the first and second stages, respectively. In a protolytic equilibrium, dianions are converted into 1-oxy-4-hydroxy-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene-9-one anions. Their one-electron reversible ECR leads to the corresponding radical dianions, followed by the formation of (3-methyl/H)-1,4-dihydroxy-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxantene-9-ones as the final products. The latter compounds can be converted into the initial (3-methyl/H)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene-1,4,9-triones. The main intermediates were characterized using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy, 3D spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations at the (U)B3LYP/6-31+G*/PCM level of theory. A general ECR scheme was proposed for both types of compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Turnstiles Featuring Bicyclic Rotators: Solution and Solid&#8208;State Investigation of Steric and Electronic Concerns</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

Comparisons to a similarly sized naphthyl rotator via 1H NMR spectroscopy provide insights into the movement of these bicyclic rotators relative to the rigid stator framework. Chemical shift increases of 0.3 ppm, or more, upon metal complexation are consistent with through&#8208;space interaction of the central arene with a bound PdCl2 guest. &#160;Further study via X&#8208;ray crystallography illustrates that rotation of the 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole unit in the solid state is likely hampered by relatively strong chalcogen bonding (N&#8230;S distance of 2.93 &#197;), forming 2S&#8208;2N squares between benzothiadiazoles of neighboring complexes. Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions (3.29&#8208;3.36 &#197;) between neighboring complexes likewise restrict solid&#8208;state rotation of the potential benzothiadiazole rotator.

Electronic and circular dichroic spectra were recorded in CHCl3. Both compounds exhibited similar spectra, and their longest wavelength absorption band with a low intensity was attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1. These compounds exhibited CPL with higher dissymmetry factors of glum (6.0&#8211;6.8 &#215; 10&#8211;3) than unlocked helicenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;fused Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of penta&#8208; and hexahelicenes with terminal thiophene rings is achieved by isomerization of ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted teraryls using F&#252;rstner's method. Best results were obtained with JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of three penta&#8208; and three hexahelicenes containing two terminal thiophene units is described. The syntheses of pentahelicenes consist of 1,4&#8208;bisalkynylation of a benzene precursor and double Suzuki coupling in 2,3&#8208;position to introduce thiophene units. The ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion yielding the final products was achieved with F&#252;rstner's protocol using platinum(II) chloride or JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalysts. A similar approach to hexahelicenes started with a naphthalene derivative, where 2,7&#8208;bisalkynylation and subsequent double Suzuki coupling with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acid at 1,8&#8208;position furnished precursors, in which ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion to the respective hexahelicenes was achieved with platinum(II) chloride or, favourably, with indium(III) chloride. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded for all helicenes and HOMO/LUMO gaps were calculated with DFT methods.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of three penta- and three hexahelicenes containing two terminal thiophene units is described. The syntheses of pentahelicenes consist of 1,4-bisalkynylation of a benzene precursor and double Suzuki coupling in 2,3-position to introduce thiophene units. The &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8217; fusion yielding the final products was achieved with F&#252;rstner's protocol using platinum(II) chloride or JohnPhos-complexed gold(I) as catalysts. A similar approach to hexahelicenes started with a naphthalene derivative, where 2,7-bisalkynylation and subsequent double Suzuki coupling with thiophene-2-boronic acid at 1,8-position furnished precursors, in which &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8217; fusion to the respective hexahelicenes was achieved with platinum(II) chloride or, favourably, with indium(III) chloride. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded for all helicenes and HOMO/LUMO gaps were calculated with DFT methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C5&#8208;Regioselective Esterification of Dienyl Alcohols with Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here reported a C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions. The process provided a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
One&#8208;step process for the preparation of a 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester motif from readily available substrate remains a challenging work in organic synthesis. We herein report the first example of C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols, using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions, providing a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.

The concise and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids lycibarbarines A&#8722;C has been accomplished in four steps from a common intermediate derived from commercially available 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline.

For the synthesis of the unique tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton we employed a synthetic strategy that features two key transformations: iodomethyllithium&#8208;based homologation of lactone / N&#8208;alkylation to access tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton in one step and one&#8208;pot acetonide deprotection, hemiacetal formation, and spirocyclization cascade process.

         <title>Efficiently Aerobic Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles and Hydrocarbons over MnAl Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive, simple and green catalytic system has been developed for the aerobic dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons based on MnAl oxides. Good application potential was demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated that dehydrogenation proceeds mainly via an electron transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons provides an important route to corresponding aromatic compounds. Herein, an efficient and selective MnAlO&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, imines and hydrocarbons is presented. The reaction features excellent yields of the products, mild reaction conditions, readily available and reusable catalyst. Various N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons can be tolerated by the reaction system and transformed to the corresponding aromatic counterparts. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction proceeds mainly through an electron transfer mechanism.

         <title>DBS&#8208;based Eutectogels: organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the Michael Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular eutectogels were obtained from the gelation of 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;D&#8208;sorbitol in cholinium chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DES), differing for the nature of the hydrogen bond donor. Ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol and urea were tested. Soft materials were fully characterized, determining critical gelation concentration, gel&#8208;sol transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, to have information about the organization of the gelator in the tridimensional network, resonance light scattering, circular dichroism and polarized optical microscopy investigations were performed. Eutectogels were used as organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the L&#8208;proline catalyzed Michael addition reaction. The probe reaction was carried out in gel phase and in DES solution. Data collected shed light on the effect that gel microenvironment exerts on the outcome of the reaction. In general, gel phases allowed having comparable or even better results than the ones collected in DES solution, with better results obtained in soft materials with the highest organization, as accounted for by the presence of larger aggregates and the occurrence of stronger intermolecular interactions. In turn, this accounts also for the effect of substrates structure that indicates that better yields could be obtained in the presence of more flexible nucleophile and dienones, having more extended p&#8208;surface.</dc:description>

While the synthesis of vinyl&#8208;SCF3 is performed in the presence of bromide salts as an activator of reagent I, the synthesis of trifluoromethylthioesters was undertaken using aldehydes as starting material in the presence of a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst (HAT).

         <title>Oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N Cleavage Cascade Cyclization of N&#8208;Uracil Amidines and Tertiaryamines: Switchable Divergent Synthesis of Functionalized Pyrimidouracils and Dihydropyrimidouracils</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described. This transformation enables the formation of new C(sp3)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds via the selection of different oxidation conditions. The features of this method include tunable product selectivity, excellent chemoselectivity, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, and moderate to high yields.

         <title>Chiral Organocatalysts in Enantioselective CO2 Utilization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of efficient CO2 utilization reactions has gained a significant amount of attention in recent years. Although transformations of CO2 to produce basic chemicals have been extensively investigated, the development of catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions for the preparation of fine chemicals remains limited at this stage. Several excellent methods for catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization using chiral metal complex catalysts have been reported. Many researchers have also focused on developing organocatalyzed approaches to enantioselective CO2 utilization, and several excellent examples have appeared in recent years. Herein, recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts are reviewed to provide a forecast for organocatalyzed enantioselective CO2 utilization research.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Chemoselectivity in the PBu3&#8208;Catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Chalcone with Ethyl Acrylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origins of regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cross Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction of chalcone with ethyl acrylate have been theoretically investigated.







Abstract
Disclosing the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier (R&#8722;C) reaction remains a challenge. Here, a comprehensive study on the possible mechanisms and origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of PBu3&#8208;catalyzed R&#8722;C reactions between ethyl acrylate and chalcone is performed by DFT. Both cross and homo R&#8722;C reactions are investigated and compared. The computational results show that the cross R&#8722;C reaction is energetically favorable than the homo R&#8722;C reaction, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail product being generated preferentially. Moreover, the C&#8722;C bond formation process is identified to be the regioselectivity&#8208; and chemoselectivity&#8208;determining step. The CDFT and Parr function analyses are successfully used to predict the origins of chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, respectively. This work would provide a valuable case for exploring the origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the phosphine catalyzed reactions, which should be helpful to understand and control the selectivities by rational design.

An acid&#8208;controlled regional diverse synthesis of building blocks was used for the construction of CF3&#8208;containing Bispiro[oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208; benzothiophenone]s under a mild condition.







Abstract
Here described an acid&#8208;controlled regional diverse synthesized process of CF3&#8208;containing ketoimines by the condensation of benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethlamine.

         <title>Acid Catalyzed Multicomponent Reaction to Access Functionalized N&#8208;Benzhydryl Amides: A Tandem Ritter Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of sterically hindered N&#8208;benzhydryl amide derivatives is reported. The tandem Ritter reaction demonstrated broad scope, atom economy and bond forming efficiency. The highly functionalized amide products have potential for further useful transformations.







Abstract
Acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of N&#8208;benzhydryl amide derivatives from aldehydes, N,N&#8208;disubstituted arylamines and nitriles is reported. The reaction is compatible with electronically differentiating aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes/acetals, different nucleophiles (cyclic and acyclic N,N&#8208;disubstituted arylamines,&#946;&#8208;naphthols, 1,3 dicarbonyl, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxy benzene), alkyl nitriles, aryl/heteroaryl nitriles in catalytic TFA/TfOH through tandem Ritter reaction. The one&#8208;pot MCR with broad substrate scope generated a wide variety of sterically hindered N&#8208;substituted amides and is successfully applied for the synthesis of isoindolinone.

         <title>Evaluation of the Stereochemical Lability of Benzo&#8208;Cycloheptene&#8208;Based Drugs Endowed with Potentially Modulable Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tendence of some popular chiral drugs (endowed with tricyclic&#8208;structures characterized by stereogenic&#8208;plane) to underwent racemization by flipping of their chiral&#8208;plane has been investigated by resorting to both experimental and theoretical approach. The obtained results suggested which structural modifications can be rationally designed in order to modulate their intrinsic stereolability, so allowing to suitably increase their enantiomerization barrier.







Abstract
An experimental and theoretical study was carried out to analyze the configurational lability possessed by some of the most common drugs endowed with a central non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered cycloheptadiene ring, which confers chirality to these compounds. In fact, the absence of planarity allows the existence of two enantiomeric species that can interconvert thanks to a ring overturning mechanism. The energy barrier that opposes the inversion of the chiral tricyclic scaffold characterizing such species, which is strongly dependent on the presence of appropriate substituents on the two external cycles, has been investigated through Dynamic&#8208;HPLC and off&#8208;column racemization techniques, as well as through assessments based on molecular modelling approaches. Interesting indications were obtained by making targeted structural changes to allow accurate control of the stereolability characterizing the tricyclic framework.

The energy barrier that opposes the inversion of the chiral tricyclic scaffold characterizing such species, which is strongly dependent on the presence of appropriate substituents on the two external cycles, has been investigated through Dynamic-HPLC and off-column racemization techniques, as well as through assessments based on molecular modelling approaches. Interesting indications were obtained by making targeted structural changes to allow accurate control of the stereolability characterizing the tricyclic framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Berkeleylactone A by Ring Closing Alkyne Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new route to the macrolactone antibiotic berkeleylactone A was developed. As a key step, a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) of an ester substrate featuring 1&#8208;propynyl termini was used. The carboxylic part of the substrate was easily assembled using alkyne chemistry, like carboxylation of a diyne followed by isomerization of the ynoate section to a dienoate and dihydroxylation of the 4,5&#8208;double bond. The synthesis of the alcohol part of the ester started with opening of (R)&#8208;propylene oxide with an acetylide and was followed by two triple bond migrations. After successful RCAM which formed the C8&#8208;C9 bond, the triple bond was selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding alkene before the 4,5&#8208;diol was oxidized to the 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;oxo derivative. At this stage, the thioether was formed and the 8,9&#8208;double bond reduced. We also prepared the 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog of berkeleylactone A. However, it turned out that its antibacterial activity was slightly reduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Oxyacetoxylation of Arylynamines and Ynamides To Construct &#945;&#8208;Acetoxyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines and ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides highly regio&#8208; and chemoselectively in good to excellent yields, leaving the N&#8208;heteroaryl rings intact, is reported.







Abstract
Ynamides/arylynamines are challenging substrates for oxyacetoxylation, especially due to various reactive sites of the N&#8208;heteroaryl ring. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines/ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides in good to excellent yields. The transformation completes in a short time to afford solely the product in a highly regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner through &#946;&#8208;iodo keteneiminium intermediate, without functionalising the N&#8208;heteroaryl moiety.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Alkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with sulfamates allows to functionalize alkanes used as the limiting component, selectively at tertiary centers. Valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks can be isolated in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
The development of an efficient catalytic system enabling the conversion of alkanes to valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks is reported. Light alkanes can be selectively functionalized by an intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reaction that proceeds at room temperature in the presence of only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a dirhodium(II) complex. Selective amination of tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H within acyclic or cyclic alkanes used as limiting components leads to the corresponding amides isolated with yields in the 51&#8211;96&#8201;% range. The reaction, that can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, applies with equal levels of efficiency and selectivity to more complex hydrocarbons.

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase IRED, NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. The current challenges and opportunities in organocatalytic and biocatalytic ARA are also discussed.







Abstract
This review summarizes the recent progress of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA), a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis, and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually Hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.

         <title>Reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination of Nitroarenes with Aryl (pseudo)Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is developed. The use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinaco&#8208;lato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of this protocol.







Abstract
De novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is described. The exquisite use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, and wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of the current protocol. Moreover, application of this technique to the syntheses of advanced intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients also proved successful, thus providing an alternative step&#8208;economical approach to the syntheses of diarylamine&#8208;incorporated molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigation demonstrates that an amine and a nitrosoarene intermediates might be involved in this reductive event.

         <title>Enantioselective Aldol Reaction with Difluoroenoxysilanes Catalyzed by Cationic Palladium Aqua Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, is described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, has been described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The palladium catalysts, previously discovered and reported by Sodeoka, are easily prepared in two steps from PdCl2(MeCN)2. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7, the reaction being more efficient using electron&#8208;rich aldehydes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot procedure for the difunctionalization of alkynes has been developed.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot procedure for the difunctionalization of alkynes by C&#8722;C triple bond oxidation and transformation towards chromone derivatives has been developed. It involves cascade reactions for carbonylation of alkynes, base&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage, and intramolecular cyclization. This procedure provides an efficient protocol for the synthesis of polysubstituted chromones from readily available starting materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Diacetoxylation of Styrenes Mediated by Chiral Iodoarene Catalyst
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an asymmetric electrosynthetic reaction mediated by a catalytic amount of chiral iodoarene has been accomplished. Important aspects of the design of such transformations are disclosed, providing guidance for the development of novel enantioselective iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed processes promoted electrochemically.







Abstract
Organocatalysis with chiral iodoarenes has emerged as a powerful approach for performing enantioselective transformations. However, it suffers from the need to utilize stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids or similar high energy oxidants. Electrosynthesis enables eliminating stoichiometric redox reagents by replacing them with electric stimuli. In this context, an electrochemically&#8208;promoted variant of the chiral iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric diacetoxylation of styrenes was evaluated. The screening of reaction parameters established a set of conditions under which, for the first time, an enantioselective electrochemical oxidation mediated by a chiral iodoarene achieving a catalytic turnover has been accomplished. The reaction was applied for the synthesis of an array of products in 15&#8211;60&#8201;% yields and 0&#8211;84&#8201;% ee. The modest efficiency of the electrocatalysis was traced to a partial direct oxidation of styrene substrates leading to racemic products and undesired dimeric side&#8208;products. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that such outcome originates from a somewhat difficult electrochemical oxidation of the applied iodoarene catalyst. Present work provides important insights and implications for the design of more efficient electrocatalytic systems employing chiral iodoarenes as mediators.

         <title>Blue&#8208;LED Synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones by Peroxidase&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Substituted Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Horseradish peroxidase activated by hydroperoxide of 2&#8208;MeTHF catalyzes the synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones under blue&#8208;LED Photon irradiation in the presence of meso&#8208;TPP. Lignin nanoparticles worked as an electroactive platform in improving the activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
Pummerer's ketones resembling the tricyclic scaffold of bioactive natural substances were synthesized by blue&#8208;LED driven Horseradish Peroxidase oxidative coupling of substituted phenols in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran by using meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin as photosensitizer and dioxygen as primary oxidant. The application of functionalized lignin nanoparticles as a renewable and efficient platform for the immobilization of the enzyme extended the effectiveness of the overall process to heterogeneous catalysis under buffer limiting conditions.

         <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Imines by Aluminum Hydride Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the catalytic activity of electronically unsaturated three coordinated aluminum hydride cations [LAlH]+[HB(C6F5)3]&#8208; (1) and [LAlH]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8208; (2) in hydrosilylation of imines has been disclosed (L = {(2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3N)P(Ph2)}2N). A variety of organo&#8208;silanes such as Et3SiH, MePhSiH2, PhSiH3, TMDSO, and PHMS are screened in this endeavour. The amines as products of catalysis and subsequent hydrolysis were obtained in good to excellent yields. Further, a series of controlled experiments systematically designed to investigate the underlying mechanistic pathway through multinuclear NMR analysis showed Lewis adduct formation between cationic aluminum centre and the imine nitrogen, which subsequently undergoes reaction with silane to afford the product. The hydrosilylation of imine performed with Et3SiH using catalyst 1 with a loading of 2 mol% at 60 oC occurs smoothly. Whereas 2 led to the product formation with Et3SiH only when used in stoichiometric quantity. Further, to investigate this unique behaviour of 1 NMR investigations were performed and revealed that the anion in 1 competes for hydride delivery and also in&#8208;situ generates B(C6F5)3 that cooperatively reinforces the catalytic activity of 1.</dc:description>

The hydrosilylation of imine performed with Et3SiH using catalyst 1 with a loading of 2 mol% at 60 oC occurs smoothly. Whereas 2 led to the product formation with Et3SiH only when used in stoichiometric quantity. Further, to investigate this unique behaviour of 1 NMR investigations were performed and revealed that the anion in 1 competes for hydride delivery and also in-situ generates B(C6F5)3 that cooperatively reinforces the catalytic activity of 1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PCCP&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Allenes Bearing Heteroaromatic Sulfenyl Group
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, one&#8208;step Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed reaction of propargyl alcohol derivatives with heterocyclic thiols was performed with the aid of pentacarboxycyclopenatadiene (PCCP) catalyst. This reported approach provides an access to tetrasubstituted allenes substituted with heterocyclic thioethers in good to excellent yield under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We report a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenyl compounds decorated with heterocyclic sulfenyl group. The reaction proceeds readily from available propargylic alcohols in the presence of pentacarboxycyclopenatadienes (PCCPs) as organocatalysts. The developed strategy provides tetrasubstituted allene derivatives in high yields (from 55 to 98&#8201;%) and under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Evolution of Phosphite&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands for the Pd&#8208;Allylic Substitution and Their Application in Building Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept provides an overview of the evolution in the ligand design of biaryl phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the asymmetric Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution. In addition, the effectiveness of this approach in the construction of chiral bi&#8208; and tricyclic complex molecules is also summarized.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) is a highly effective method for producing chiral molecules with alkene&#8208;substituted frameworks which can be further derivatized. However, its stereochemical outcome is affected by the steric requirements of the substrate and only a narrow set of nucleophiles yield excellent enantioselectivities. In this regard, phosphite&#8208;oxazolines have emerged as strong candidates to be privileged ligands for this process, providing results that surpass most of the previously published studies. They have provided high enantiocontrol when used in the Pd&#8208;AAS of several hindered and unhindered substrates, using a wide range of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;nucleophiles. In this concept, we review and discuss the current progress made in the design of tailor&#8208;made phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the Pd&#8208;AAS of a broad range of substrates and nucleophiles and its application in the construction of chiral complex molecules.

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Reactions of Alkylzinc Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkylzinc halides to imines has been studied under different conditions. Whereas Mannich&#8208;type reactions with sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating, the use N&#8208;alkyl imines required an additional activation: the use of acetyl chloride led to the preparation of N&#8208;acyl tertiary amines whereas trimethylsilyl chloride afforded a direct access to unprotected secondary amines.







Abstract
Mannich&#8208;type reactions involving alkylzinc reagents have been developed using different strategies. We show that the addition of these organometallic species to sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating and affords Mannich products in moderate to excellent yields (14 examples, 30&#8211;99&#8201;%). Interestingly, N&#8208;alkyl imines were also found to be suitable partners after activation as an acyliminium by acetyl chloride (12 examples, 49&#8211;86&#8201;%) or, more originally, by TMSCl (14 examples, 26&#8211;87&#8201;%). These methods proved complementary, leading to the preparation of both N&#8208;protected secondary or tertiary amines and N&#8208;unprotected secondary amines in good yields, with an increased eco&#8208;compatibility, and under simple conditions.

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Aldehydes and Ketones with Transient Directing Groups: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of aldehydes and ketones has recently significantly grown thanks to a concept of transient directing group. In this strategy, the directing group is generated in&#8197;situ which limits the functional group manipulation as well as allows new reactivities. This review presents the latest research works carried out in this area over the period 2020&#8211;2023.







Abstract
In order to directly functionalize C&#8722;H bonds of complex molecules and, in particular, to control the regioselectivity of the reaction, a wide range of directing groups has been used. However, these directing groups need to be installed and removed for further applications, which may limit the use of C&#8722;H activation in synthesis. Concerning aldehydes and ketones, a transient directing group strategy has recently emerged to overcome this drawback. The addition of an additive, in general an amine, allowed the in&#8197;situ formation of the real directing group to achieve C&#8722;H activation. This review presents the latest developments in the field over the period 2020&#8211;2023.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation and Benzylation of Tyrosine at the &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(2) Positions: Expanding the Library of Unnatural Tyrosines</title>

         <dc:description>
The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed arylation and benzylation at the remote &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(2) position of the aryl ring in tyrosines and the assembling of C(2) arylated and benzylated tyrosines are reported. Expansion of the substrate scope in site&#8208;selective remote &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization and synthesis of biaryl&#8208;, terphenyl&#8208; and diarylmethane&#8208;based unnatural tyrosines and peptides are shown.







Abstract
This paper describes Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed intermolecular arylation and benzylation of remote &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond (C(2) position) of the aryl ring in tyrosine derivatives and expansion of the library of unnatural tyrosine. Various racemic and enantiopure bis C(2) (ortho C&#8722;H) arylated and benzylated tyrosine derivatives were assembled in good yields. Removal of the picolinoyl moiety after the C(2)&#8722;H arylation and assembling of tyrosine&#8208;based peptides using C(2)&#8722;H arylated tyrosines were shown. Tyrosine derivatives and biaryl amino acids are vital scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Correspondingly, this work is a contribution towards the expansion of the unnatural tyrosine library with biaryl&#8208; or terphenyl and diarylmethane&#8208;based tyrosine scaffolds.

         <title>Construction of Polyheterocyclic Compounds by Lewis Acid Mediated Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo&#8208;fused polyheterocyclic compounds from 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 1,4&#8208;benzoxazinones via intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition has been demonstrated. The protocol obviates column chromatography and products were isolated in good to excellent yields by simple filtration. Electronic effects of both electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are well tolerated.







Abstract
An efficient domino approach has been developed for the synthesis of polyheterocyclic derivatives constituting pyrrole moiety. Lewis acid catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 1,4&#8208;benzoxazinone derivatives resulted in the formation of polyheterocyclic compounds under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in good to excellent yield. The reaction is highly regioselective for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond construction proceeded via intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The protocol is highly efficient, obviates column chromatography and the products are obtained by simple filtration followed by washing with solvent.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Olefins with Aliphatic Amines without Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins with aliphatic amines was successfully performed without acidic additives. Despite the strong basicity of the nucleophiles, targeted amide derivatives of styrene, oct&#8208;1&#8208;ene and isoprene were obtained with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Mechanistic considerations were made supported by experimental observations.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation reactions of olefins using aliphatic amines were performed under carbon monoxide atmosphere. Despite the strong basicity of the applied nucleophiles, the targeted amides were successfully synthesized in the absence of acidic additives. Styrene, oct&#8208;1&#8208;ene and isoprene were transformed to the corresponding amide isomers in moderate to good isolated yields under optimized reaction conditions. Various aliphatic amines were used as N&#8208;nucleophiles. The effect of chiral diphosphines on product distribution, that is, on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities was also studied. Plausible explanation was given for the additive&#8208;free hydroaminocarbonylation reaction.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Phosphite and Phosphoramidite Ligands for Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the applications of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands synthesized by different modules in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. It provides ideas for the design, synthesis, and application of modular ligands synthesis for hydroformylation reactions.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins is an important method for synthesizing aldehydes, and it is worth noting that regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the product controlled by ligand are the most commonly used strategies. The modular synthesis of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands have significant advantages of simple synthesis and high catalytic activity, which was why these ligands have been widely used in hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we focus on the synthesis methods and design ideas of such ligands, as well as their application effects in hydroformylation reactions. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and synthesis of ligands in hydroformylation subsequently.

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an unprecedented synthesis of difluoromethoxylated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks. Pyrazoles, isoxazoles and pyrimidines could be obtained via an enaminone intermediate, whereas in the direct reaction of &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones with arylhydrazines, a Fischer indole synthesis was achieved. All these scaffolds, which are uncommon, or even sometimes novel, due to the directly attached emerging fluorinated group (EFG) &#8208;OCF2H, might be of high potential in life sciences and appear as an interesting alternative to more and more controversial classical fluorinated groups, such as the ubiquitous trifluoromethyl group.</dc:description>

&lt;p&gt;Heteroarenes are common moieties in pharmaceuticals and naturally bioactive compounds. In this work, an efficient and atom-economic rhodium and thiophenol co-catalyzed hydroheteroarylation of styrenes with heteroarenes is reported. Alkylated unprotected heteroarenes are accessed under low catalyst loading. This protocol provides straightforward access to indoles bearing an all-carbon quaternary center at the C3-position.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrazine Derivative as Supramolecular Host for Immobilization of Palladium Nanoparticles for Efficient Suzuki Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular palladium catalyst PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd has been synthesized using a convenient strategy through coordination between pyrazine host PYZ&#8208;TA and co&#8208;released PdNPs under standard Suzuki conditions. The catalytic efficiency of PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd was further explored in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with a variety of aryl halides and aryl boronic acids/aryl boronic acid pinacol esters. The excellent yield of the final products and their easy separation highlights the efficiency of the solid catalyst.







Abstract
Palladium nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively explored as unique catalyst for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions. Nonetheless, because of extreme tendency of nanoparticles to undergo agglomeration, the immobilization of these metal NPs on organic frameworks is an important area of research. The present investigation demonstrates the synthesis of pyrazine derivative PYZ&#8208;TA as a supramolecular host for holding co&#8208;released Pd NPs derived from the original catalyst (Pd(II)) under standard Suzuki coupling. Unprecedent, physical bars are not required to capture Pd NPs within the pores of supramolecular host. The as obtained catalyst PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd exhibits high potential to undergo self&#8208;assembly in solid as well as in liquid state. The PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd ensemble shows high catalytic activity and recyclability (up to seven cycles) in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions using low palladium loading and provides the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). Therefore, this study provides an efficient strategy to develop an easy to synthesize palladium centered solid catalyst through coordination between organic host and Pd NPs.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Quinacridone Photocatalysts for the Homogeneous Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, quinacridone (QA) functionalization with EWG groups and N&#8208;alkylation is described, in order to improve QA solubility and photocatalytic oxidizing activity. The synthesized derivatives acted as efficient photocatalysts in the selective aerobic oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Remarkably, N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;quinacridone (DBQA) showed the best performances, leading to quantitative thioanisole conversion to sulfoxide in 20 minutes.







Abstract
Evaluation of quinacridone (QA) derivatives as homogeneous metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is here presented. QA derivatives were synthetized and systematically characterized, measuring their ground state and excited state redox potentials in dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), in order to understand how structural modifications influenced their photocatalytic properties. In particular, the effect of dicyanomethylene and nitro EWG groups was investigated, in order to develop a photocatalyst capable of promoting oxidative processes in the presence of molecular oxygen. Among the analyzed derivatives, 2,9&#8208;dinitro&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DNDBQA) was the one with the highest excited state reduction potential (Ered*=1.60&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), while N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) showed valuable excited state redox potentials (Ered*=1.29&#8197;V; Eox*=&#8722;1.28&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), making it suitable for bimodal applications in oxidative and reductive photocatalytic processes. Afterwards, the synthetized QA derivatives were examined as photocatalysts to promote the selective aerobic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide. Promising results in thioanisole oxidation were achieved with all the QA derivatives tested as photocatalysts, in terms of yield and selectivity. Remarkably, DBQA showed the best performances, catalyzing the reaction in only 20 minutes, using 0.5&#8201;% of the photocatalyst, and showing excellent performances in the oxidation of several thioether derivatives.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light induced radical 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylallyl alcohols was developed toward &#946;&#8208;polochloromethylated ketones with commercially available CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 as tri&#8208; and dichloromethyl radical precursors.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced radical 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylallyl alcohols was developed under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Commercially available CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 were used as tri&#8208; and dichloromethyl radical precursors. Structurally diverse &#946;&#8208;polochloromethylated ketones were obtained in good to moderate yields via neophyl&#8208;type rearrangement. Besides, the polychloromethyl group can be easily transformed into other useful functional groups.

         <dc:description>
This Review reports metal containing heterogeneous catalytic systems for the transformations of aromatic amines to azo compounds hydrazines and 2H&#8208;indzoles.







Abstract
The most significant task in synthetic organic chemistry is developing organic reactions from a green and sustainable perspective. In these ways, heterogeneous catalysts are essential in many organic reactions. Thus, this study focuses on the synthesis of N&#8722;N bond bearing organic frameworks, particularly aromatic azo compounds and indazoles, using a heterogeneous metal catalyst. Organic molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bonds are greatly sought after in the synthesis of dyes, photochemical switches, food additives, and bioactive chemicals due to industry and human requirements. Finally, this review provides an overview of synthetic routes for the formation of N&#8722;N bonds by using various heterogeneous metal catalytic systems.

         <title>An Improved Procedure for Aryne Generation from o&#8208;Triazenylarylboronic Acids through One&#8208;Pot Boronate Formation/Silica Gel Treatment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The procedure for generating arynes from o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids was improved. Our recent procedure required to use excess aryne precursors to arynophiles, but the new one&#8208;pot procedure, which involves boronate formation and silica gel treatment, allows for high&#8208;yielding transformations using the precursors as limiting reagents. This procedure is particularly useful for generating complex arynes from elaborated precursors.







Abstract
We have developed an improved method for generating aryne from o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids. Unlike the previous method that required excess o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids as aryne precursors, we used corresponding boronates as limiting reagents, which resulted in high yields. By combining the formation of boronates and aryne generation through silica gel treatment in one&#8208;pot, we were able to effectively use a wide range of o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids in reactions with various arynophiles. This one&#8208;pot method was particularly suitable for transforming complex aryne precursors with different functional groups.

         <title>Amidyl Radical Directed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization with Silyl Enol Ethers via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic site&#8208;selective functionalization of hydroxamic acid derivatives was described. This transformation was achieved through amidyl radical directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer and intermolecular radical addition. Besides, this protocol proceeds under mild reaction conditions with high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein we reported an efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxamides with silyl enol ethers as radical acceptors. The reaction proceeded through amidyl radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation via radical addition of silyl enol ethers. The process features mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, allowing the preparation of a series of carboxamides with pendant carbonyl moieties.

A photocatalytic perfluoroalkylation/cyclization cascade of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with perfluoroalkyl halides leading to polysubstituted 1,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction is regioselective, with the acrylamido moiety and enaminic double bond functioning as the radical acceptor and built&#8208;in radical trap, respectively, and features a short reaction time, low catalyst loading and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;induced perfluoroalkylative cyclization of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes leading to pentasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;ones is presented. The reaction is regiospecific, for the radical adds across the acrylamido moiety, whereas the enaminic double bond functions as a built&#8208;in radical trap. It could be carried out on a 2&#8208;gram scale, and the sunlight is a usable light source. Other virtues of the protocol include a short reaction time, a low catalyst loading, mild conditions and a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Activation of N&#8722;O &#963; Bonds with Transition Metals: A Versatile Platform for Organic Synthesis and C&#8722;N Bonds Formation
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the versatile reactivity of transition metal catalysts toward N&#8722;O &#963; bonds. Emphasis is made on the mechanistic pathways and their experimental and computational proofs in the described transformations.







Abstract
N&#8722;O &#963; bonds containing compounds are versatile substrates for organic synthesis under transition metal catalysis. Their ability to react through both polar (oxidative addition, formation of metallanitrene, nucleophilic substitution) and radical pathways (single electron transfer, homolytic bond scission) have triggered the development of various synthetic methodologies, particularly toward synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In this review, we discuss the different modes of activation of N&#8722;O bonds in the presence of transition metal catalysts, emphasizing the experimental and computational mechanistic proofs in the literature to help to design new synthetic pathways toward the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds.
