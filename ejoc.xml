      <title>Quinoline ligands improve the classic direct C&#8211;H functionalisation/intramolecular cyclisation of diaryl ethers to dibenzofurans</title>
      <dc:description>The C&#8211;H functionalisation approach to the synthesis of dibenzofurans is hampered by a number of problems. Herein we describe the evolution of a cheap, bench stable quinoline ligand, which obviates most of the current limitations and allows for a high yielding synthesis of a range of valuable dibenzofurans. Dibenzofurans are important motifs in natural products and compounds with wide biological activity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement is an efficient method to prepare &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsatured carbonyl compounds starting from propargylic alcohols and this review presents the remarkable progress made during the last decade in this reaction.

To be noticed in particular are the new and efficient&#160; cascade&#160; processes affording a wide range of carbo&#8208;and heterocyclic molecules.

      <title>C(sp2)&#8211;Si Bond Functionalization through Intramolecular Activation by Alkoxides</title>
      <dc:description>Organosilicon reagents are invaluable tools in the hands of the modern chemist that allow accomplishing a number of synthetically useful transformations. While some are standard reactions, other are more complex transformations, such as the Brook rearrangement and its variants. This carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen silyl migration represents a privileged method to generate transient carbanionic species well suited to undergo functionalization upon electrophilic substitution in the presence of an electrophile. This minireview focuses on recent advances in C(sp  2  )&#8211;Si bond functionalization through intramolecular activation by alkoxides. The key elements of reactivity will be highlighted in the introduction to allow the proper understanding of the migration process. Then, an overview of the reactivity of substrates incorporating the C(sp  2  )&#8211;Si motif and their synthetic applications will be provided.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure 6,11&#8208;Methylene Lipoxin B4 Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin. Intending to enable prospective structure variations in connection with the C1&#8211;C5 and C14&#8211;C20 fragments, a convergent total synthesis has been developed. Optically active C1&#8211;C12 building blocks were build&#8208;up from cycloheptatriene 1&#8208;carbonester (C6&#8211;C11, C21) and glutaryl chloride (C1&#8211;C5) using Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type acylation and chiral HPLC. The C13&#8208;C20 segment had been generated via a five&#8208;step sequence starting from heptanoyl chloride. Horner key olefination enabled assembly of the carbon backbone. A final five step sequence including a chelate Cram reduction of the unsaturated ketone moiety afforded the target 6,11&#8208;methylene LXB4 methyl ester.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Recognition by Chalcogen Bond: Selective Charge&#8208;transfer Crystal Formation of Dimethylnaphthalene with Selenadiazolotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane</title>
      <dc:description>The title nonplanar electron acceptor ( 1 ) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue ( 2 ) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of 1 , 2 , and their CT crystals revealed that the Se &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N contact in 2 competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8208;H &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N hydrogen bond. The stronger ChB involving Se is the key for 1 to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN (&gt;97 wt%) from a complex isomer mixture containing ca. 10 wt% each of 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN by a simple, efficient and straightforward mixing&#8208;filtration&#8208;heating process.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A cyclic epicatechin trimer with  C3  symmetry, connected through C&#8211;C bonds between A&#8208; and B&#8208;rings, was isolated as an oxidative coupling product of (&#8722;)&#8208;epicatechin with polyphenol oxidase. It was previously isolated as an oxidation product of epicatechin with CuCl2; however, only the 2D structure was proposed. Its stereochemistry was assigned using various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, and theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. It was suggested that the less strained cyclic trimer with the (aR,aR  ,aR) configuration was formed atroposelectively in the cyclization process.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Iodide</title>
      <dc:description>In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI  2  is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI  2  . This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur Tuning of [1,3]&#8208;Dioxolo[4.5&#8208;f]benzodioxole (DBD) Fluorescent Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The replacement of oxygen by sulfur atoms of [1,3]&#8208;dioxolo[4.5&#8208;  f  ]benzodioxole (DBD) fluorescent dyes is an efficient way to adjust the photophysical properties (sulfur tuning). While previously developed S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes exhibit considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission wavelength, the heavy atom effect of four sulfur atoms cause low fluorescence quantum yields and short fluorescence lifetimes. Herein we demonstrate that the replacement of less than four sulfur atoms (S  1  &#8208;DBD, 1,2&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD, and 1,4&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes) permits a fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties. In some cases, a similar influence on the wavelength without the detrimental effect on the quantum yields and lifetimes is observed. Furthermore, the synthetic accessibility of S  1  &#8208; and S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes is improved, compared with S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes. For coupling with biomolecules a series of reactive derivatives of the new dyes were developed (azides, OSu esters, alkynes, maleimides).</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric guest binding in chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. The zirconium compound was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displays a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery the cooperativity factors &#945; (= 4K1/K2) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.</dc:description>

      <title>An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold</title>
      <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied widely as a bioisosteric component of drugs. Not found in nature, this molecular unit approximates the distance of a  p  &#8208;disubstituted benzene which is replaced in medicines as a method of improving treatments. Predicting interactions of these drugs with specific active sites requires knowledge of the non&#8208;covalent interactions engaged by this subunit. Structure determinations and computational analysis (Hirshfeld analysis, 2D fingerprint plots, DFT) of 7 BCP derivatives chosen to probe specific and directional interactions. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of various non&#8208;covalent interactions including I&#183;&#183;I, I&#183;&#183;N, N&#8208;  ..O, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;O, and H&#8208;C&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C contacts. The preference of halogen bonding (I&#183;&#183;I or I&#183;&#183;N) in BCP  1&#8208;4  strictly depends upon the electronic nature and angle between bridgehead substituents. The transannular distance in co&#8208;crystals  2  and  4  was longer as compared to monomers  1  and  3. Stronger N&#8208;H..O and weaker C&#8208;H..O contacts were observed for BCP  5  while the O  ..  H interaction was a prominent contact for BCP  6. The presence of 3D BCP units prevented the p&#183;&#183;p stacking between phenyl rings in  3,  4,  and  7. The BCP skeleton was often rotationally averaged, indicating fewer interactions compared to bridgehead groups. Using DFT analysis, geometries were optimized and molecular electrostatic potentials were calculated on the BCP surfaces. These interaction profiles may be useful for designing BCP analogs of drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Domino Processes of Arynes Reacting with Three Classes of Nucleophiles for Organic Syntheses</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic application of arynes is broadened by their reactions with neutral  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;, and  O  &#8208;containing nucleophiles to produce three types of compounds. Accordingly, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines are synthesized from Schiff bases, alkynes, and arynes through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Epoxides are prepared from thioethers and arynes along with aldehydes or ketones through a Johnson&#8208;Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky reaction. Phenolic ethers are produced from allyl ethers and arynes through a Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement. These target molecules, including natural products &#947;&#8208;asarone, asaricin, and a cholesteryl phenolic ether, are formed through reactions initiated by arynes. These new reactions share a prevailing feature of domino processes, which are carried out in a single flask and afford the desired products in good to high yields  .</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Nucleobase di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalized Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of nucleobase&#8208;functionalized porphyrins was achieved  via  two strategies: substitution and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Following the first strategy resulted in four porphyrins having two nucleobases at the&#160;  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by flexible methylene linkers. In order to synthesize the targeted molecules, 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin) was reacted with thymine, cytosine, adenine and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine, a precursor of guanine, in the presence of a suitable base. Thymine and cytosine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N1 site, whereas adenine and amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N9 site. The synthesis of a porphyrin bearing four thymine moieties at its four  meso&#8208;  positions is also described. &#160;Furthermore, following the Sonogashira cross coupling reaction strategy led to the formation of&#160; four new porphyrins bearing two NBs in  trans  positions. Ethynyl&#8208;substituted nucleobases were reacted with 5,15&#8208;dibromo&#8208;10,20&#8208;dipentylporphyrin under sonogashira cross coupling conditions to result in four rigid porphyrins having two nucleobases at the  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by rigid ethynyl linkers.&#160; All the tectons have been characterized and could be used in the formation of molecular H&#8208;bonded networks.

      <title>Role of lipophilicity on the activity of hexameric cyclic peptoid ion carriers</title>
      <dc:description>Two families of hexameric cyclic peptoids decorated with linear  N  &#8208;alkyl and alternated  N  &#8208;alkyl/  N  &#8208;benzyl side chains (  2a&#8208;d  and  3a&#8208;c  , respectively) were designed and synthesized in order to correlate their logP values (from 2.55 to 6.83) to their ionophoric activities. The present contribution confirms the general ability of hexameric cyclic peptoids to behave as efficient cation carriers, corroborates their preference for Na  +  ion, among the tested alkali metals, and suggests a Na  +  /H  +  antiport transport mechanism (rate limited by the transport of the proton) for these new ionophores. Our observations indicate that in order to attain an efficient ionophoric activity, a narrow range of liphophilicity is required (4&lt; logP &lt; 5). Moreover, to gain information on the solid state stucture of ionophoric cyclic peptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains,&#160;X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies were performed on exemplar compound  2a  . Crystal structure of compound  2a  confirms the tendency of ionophoric cyclopeptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains to form layered assemblies.</dc:description>

      <title>Unexpected ring opening during the imination of camphor&#8208;type bicyclic ketones</title>
      <dc:description>A new ring opening reaction was found while attempting to isolate the imines from  ortho  &#8208;heteroatom substituted anilines and camphor&#8208;like bicyclic ketones. The benzoazoles containing a cyclopentanemethyl group at position 2 of the heterocycle were isolated instead of the expected imines. The detailed study of the transformation, including EPR experiments, revealed the most probable radical mechanism. The proposed reaction pathways were confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The dichotomy of 1&#8209;2 and 2&#8209;3 bonds cleavage is discussed together with the evaluation of the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.

      <title>Fungicide precursor racemization kinetics for deracemization in complex systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the racemization area, the keto&#8208;enol equilibrium is a major player when it comes to racemizing &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The racemization kinetics in the co&#8208;crystal induced deracemization of a fungicide precursor is complex as next to the racemization catalyst, which is a base, an acidic co&#8208;former is used to ensure the crystallization of the co&#8208;crystal. Here we show that understanding of the racemization kinetics of the target compound is of key importance for optimization of the co&#8208;crystallization based deracemization process. The racemization rates in solution as a function of solvent and base concentration were determined by measuring the decreasing enrichment of the chiral ketone due to racemization over time, using a polarimeter set&#8208;up with a continuous recycling loop through the polarimeter cell. The established racemization kinetics model aligns with the experimental data giving access to the intrinsic racemization rate constant. The proposed mechanism is first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess of the target compound and the base&#8208;catalyst concentration. The solvent is shown to affect the racemization constant, with protic solvents increasing this rate substantially. Finally, we observed the presence of the chiral acid co&#8208;former to alter the reaction mechanism albeit remaining first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess. Though more complex, the mechanism still followed Arrhenius law, providing key information on the impact of temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

      <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
      <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.

The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.&lt;/p&gt;
