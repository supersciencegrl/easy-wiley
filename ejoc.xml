         <title>Photo&#8208;and Electrochemical Modification of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins through Cysteine: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for the modification of cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed. Additionally, the current limitations of these methods and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future are also explored.







Abstract
Chemical modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as an efficient strategy to study and manipulate the physical and chemical properties and biological functionalities of proteins. Among the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine is one of the most frequently targeted residues for chemical modification of peptides and proteins due to its unique thiol group and its relatively low natural abundance. Cysteine is able to partake in radical and atom&#8208;, electron&#8208; and hydride&#8208;transfer reactions taking the benefit of redox activity of thiol side chain. Recently, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry have emerged as influential methodologies for enabling novel transformations in organic synthesis. These two fields both involve the generation of radical intermediates through single electron transfer processes, which align well with the redox activity of cysteine residue. Furthermore, the mild and controllable features are suitable for solving the chemo&#8208; and regioselective problems of the existing bioconjugation strategies. Given the intrinsic benefits of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis, the application of developing novel cysteine&#8208;based bioconjugation methods is increasingly compelling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for modifying cysteine amino acid residues, cysteine&#8208;containing peptides, and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed. Additionally, the current limitations of these methods and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future are also explored.

         <title>Construction of Multiple Five&#8208;Membered Rings in Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene Core for the Synthesis of a Nona&#8208;Cycle Buckybowl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relevant synthesis to an unexplored nona&#8208;cycle buckybowl (C28H14, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene) is described. The key precursor is a solution&#8208;processable hexacycle having twofold bromines and fourfold ethers. The bromines enabled forming the first two pentagons, and then the ethers facilitated yielding the nona&#8208;cycle C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;structure, unattainable so far.







Abstract
C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, commonly referred to as &#8220;buckybowls&#8221;, are provocative compounds, and their inviting functions based on the non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation are expected. Yet, achieving synthesis of some kinds of the curved structure remaining challenging. Herein we report skeletal construction of a nona&#8208;cyclic buckybowl that is synthetically unachievable heretofore, namely, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene. The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible process in which a multiple substituted dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is amenable to threefold formation of five&#8208;membered rings at its periphery. The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution&#8208;phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Mechanofluorochromic Molecules and Their Differential Mechanochromic Effects Triggered by Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the position of the nitrogen atom, three anthracene&#8208;based mechanofluorochromic compounds were designed and synthesized. The three compounds exhibit similar photophysical properties in solution, but exhibit completely different photophysical properties and mechanofluorochromic properties in the solid state.







Abstract
To investigate the influence of nitrogen atoms on the mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties, three novel anthracene&#8208;based MFC compounds were designed and synthesized, and the effects of nitrogen atom position changes on their photophysical properties and MFC properties were deeply explored. The structure of the three compounds maintains the anthracene and enone portions unchanged, with only subtle adjustments made to the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine moiety. Experimental verification revealed that these three anthracene&#8208;based compounds exhibit almost identical photophysical properties in solution but display significantly different fluorescence colors and distinct MFC properties in the solid state. The findings of this study not only offer a new perspective for understanding the MFC mechanism of anthracene&#8208;based compounds but also provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel MFC molecules.

         <title>The Gauche&#8208;Effect in 1,2&#8208;Bis(arylsulfonate)ethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure of ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzenesulfonate)ethane, was elucidated, revealing a gauche&#8208;conformation through single crystal diffraction studies. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital of the sulfonate groups and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche conformation.







Abstract
With an aim of obtaining a fundamental understanding of C&#8722;C bond conformation theory, the molecular structure of an ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzene&#8208;sulfonate)ethane, was elucidated. According to the general conformation rule for alkanes, which states that molecules adopt a stabilized structure to avoid steric repulsion, ethanes typically adopt anti&#8208;conformation. However, the title compound exhibited gauche&#8208;conformation, as revealed by a single crystal diffraction study. Theoretical studies also support this behavior. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital, attributable to the sulfonate groups, and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche&#8208;conformation. The authors conclude that the sulfonate group acts as a gauche&#8208;effect synthon, which is widely applicable in organic chemistry.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes and Other Unsaturated Systems: A Literature Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes and different &#960;&#8208;systems offers easy access to highly substituted arenes and heteroarenes. Nickel catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool for replacing expensive platinum group metals for cyclotrimerization reactions. This review summarizes the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni&#8208;phosphine, Ni&#8208;NHC, Ni&#8208;pincer, Ni&#8208;diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined. Highly substituted arenes have broad applications in pharmaceuticals and soft materials. The applications of cyclotrimerization in these areas have been illustrated.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio-/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni-phosphine, Ni-NHC, Ni-pincer, Ni-diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined. Highly substituted arenes have broad applications in pharmaceuticals and soft materials. The applications of cyclotrimerization in these areas have been illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation Reactions of Acetylene: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed the first efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of acetylene toward &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides. The synthetic utility of our protocol was showcased further in the diversification of ibrutinib and other bio&#8208;active molecules, demonstrating great potential for drug discovery.







Abstract
The simplest alkyne, acetylene, is a suitable C2 linker synthon that enables the connection of organic molecules with different functional groups. However, reactions of acetylene with advanced organic building blocks are much less explored compared to substituted alkynes. In this article, we present a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation reaction with acetylene, CO, amines, and perfluoroalkyl halides that enables the preparation of various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides in one step. This protocol also provides a new strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules, as demonstrated by the construction of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl ibrutinib derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Double Benzimidazole&#8208;Fused Quinazolines and Pyrimidines Catalyzed by Recyclable Magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>

A synthetic method of double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines was developed by recyclable magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic/vinylic substitution and oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208;/2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with benzimidazoles.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Bromoaryl)&#8208; and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles are combined and cyclized with benzimidazoles using a catalytic amount of magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 (Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74) and a base under O2 atmosphere, yielding the corresponding double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines. The catalyst can be recovered using a magnetic bar and reused multiple times without significant loss of catalytic activity. The reaction mechanism likely involves the initial formation of a C&#8722;N coupled intermediate through nucleophilic aromatic substitution, followed by oxidative cyclization.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organophotocatalytic perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of acrylamides is demonstrated. This role of pendant functionality in achieving molecular diversity was established. This reaction manifold provides access to diverse fluorinated and thiolated molecular architectures.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, organophotocatalyzed cascade perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of o&#8208;cyano and o&#8208;alkynyl acrylamides is reported. The reaction exhibits wide scope and provides polyfluorinated 1,3&#8208;quinoline diones and trifluoromethylated fused tricyclic quinolinones under mild reaction conditions and in good yields. Access to a variety of molecular architectures and the synthetic application of aliphatic thiols are the highlights of this reactivity manifold.

         <title>Preferential Binding to a Mannoside of a Pyridine&#8211;Acetylene&#8211;Phenol Macrocycle with a Fluorine Substituent in the Cavity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrocyclic host having a fluorine atom in the recognition site. This macrocycle showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside because the fluorine atom acted as a moderate infill that prevented the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside.







Abstract
We developed a pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol macrocycle in which a fluorine atom was introduced in place of a hydroxy group, as a host for the selective binding to epimers of glucose. The fluorine atom was expected to work as a negatively charged infill repelling oxygen atoms of saccharides and prevent the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside, whose cross&#8208;section size is larger than those of the corresponding epimers, especially of a mannoside. UV&#8211;Vis and fluorescence titration experiments revealed that this host showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside. 1H NMR and molecular modeling suggested that the fluorine atom acts as a moderate infill weakening the binding to a glucoside. This result indicates that selectivity for guest molecules can be modified by replacing a hydroxy group and a hydrogen atom in host molecules with a fluorine atom.

         <title>Copper(II)/Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Sequential Annulation&#8208;Olefination of 2&#8208;Arylquinoxalines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed sequential annulation&#8208;olefination reaction has been developed for the rapid construction of ortho&#8208;olefinated 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines with broad substrate scope, high mono&#8208;substitution selectivity and ortho&#8208;regioselectivity. Application to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules led to compounds with enhanced antiproliferative activities against ovarian cancer and colon cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The quinoxaline scaffold occurs in many pharmaceuticals, natural products and organic materials. In this study, a Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective annulation&#8208;olefination sequence for the formation and modification of quinoxalines was developed using ethanol and water as the solvent, with relatively broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. This protocol has been successfully applied to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the derivatives exhibited enhanced antiproliferative activities against A&#8208;2780 and HCT&#8208;116&#8197;cell lines, underscoring their potential as promising lead compounds for ovarian cancer and colon cancer treatment.

A novel and straightforward approach for synthesizing quinazolinones and quinazoline derivatives employing sulfur&#8208;mediated annulative coupling of 2&#8208;aminobenzamides and 2&#8208;aminobenzylamines in conjunction with sulfoxonium ylides has been described. This method demonstrates a broad substrate range and exhibits excellent tolerance towards various functional groups. Finally, this protocol has been successfully applied to synthesize pyrazino&#8208;fused quinazolinone derivative with adjustable fluorescence properties and tryptanthrin, a compound known for its potent antitubercular activity.

         <title>Remote Selective Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions of Aryl C&#8722;H Bonds with Carboxylic Acids at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. This work presents a remote selective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and the directing groups modifiability highlights the method's significance for pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
An efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids is developed. This acetoxylation protocol is performed under room temperature using N&#8208;fluorobenzene&#8208;sulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, exhibiting a wide range of functional group tolerance and affording &#948;&#8208;position&#8208; selective products up to 85&#8201;% yield. Notably, a diverse set of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs is also found to be compatible under the current reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction presumably proceeds through a seven&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.

         <title>Examining 1,4,2&#8208;Dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;One as an Alternative Reagent to Acyl Azides in the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,2&#8208;Dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;one serves as a safe and efficient alternative to acyl azides in the Staudinger reaction, enabling the synthesis of N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes under metal&#8208;free conditions. This method involves a heat&#8208;promoted nucleophilic attack of phosphines on 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, leading to CO2 extrusion and formation of the P&#8722;N coupling product. The effectiveness of this metal&#8208;free imidization was demonstrated in gram&#8208;scale reactions and its applicability to subsequent transformations. DFT calculations were used to elucidate the reaction pathway.

         <title>Synthesis of [6,5,5]Ring&#8208;Fused Tricyclic Triazoles by Copper&#8208;Promoted Double Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was coupled with cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles. Copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was investigated on 2&#8208;iodoaryl propynes or propynones. With catalytic amount of Cu(I) salts or with N&#8208;donor ligands on copper only the products of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions were formed. However, with an equimolar amount of copper(I) iodide and triethylamine new [6,5,5] ring&#8208;fused tricyclic triazoles were formed by azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditon coupled to a cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important biologically active compounds and synthetic intermediates. Known methods for their synthesis are limited mostly to triazoles fused to six&#8208;membered or larger rings. Herein we disclose a synthetic approach to triazoles fused to five&#8208;membered rings based on copper(I)&#8208;promoted double cyclization consisting of azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, followed by cross coupling to aryl iodides.

An electrochemical cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes via N&#8208;centered radical generation has been developed. This method enables the construction of N&#8208;heterocycle in an efficient manner. A wide range of functional groups are amenable to the established system, providing rapid access to benzotriazoles and their derivatives.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes via N&#8208;centered radical generation has been developed for the synthesis of benzotriazoles. The cyclization of o&#8208;aminyl azobenzenes bearing a sulfonyl protection on amine readily proceeds in the absence of any external transition metal catalyst or chemical oxidant, and exhibits good tolerance towards functional groups.

         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state-of-the-art of non-heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptable Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Disaccharide Subtypes Preprogrammed for Regiospecific O&#8208;Sulfation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors is presented herein. The route employs an orthogonal protecting group pattern and a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach to access CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O disaccharide precursors on gram scale. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors, including rarer subtypes such as CS&#8722;D, has been developed. From common intermediates, a series of thioglycoside D&#8208;glucosyl donors and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected D&#8208;galactosamine acceptors are utilised in a robust glycosylation reaction, achieving &#946;&#8208;selectivity and consistent yields (60&#8211;75&#8201;%) on scales &gt;2.0&#8197;g. A post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation to D&#8208;glucuronic acid and orthogonal protecting groups delivers access to CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O precursor subtypes. Of further note is a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl regioselective reductive ring opening of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected disaccharide using dichlorophenylborane (PhBCl2) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH) to access a CS&#8722;D precursor, in 73&#8201;% yield over two steps. Finally, synthesis of a 6&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated CS&#8722;C disaccharide containing a conjugable anomeric allyl tether is completed. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalysis for the Oxidative Dearomatization of PyrroleDerivatives: Mechanistic Insights and Biological Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported an oxidative dearoamatization of pyrrole derivatives to give a highly functionalized isoindolinone derivatives. Synthesized products have been analyzed for their non&#8208;cytotoxic behavior and two of them have been utilized for their antipromastigotic activity against L. Donovanai. In addition to that the mechanism has also been explored using DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report dearomatization of pyrrole ring followed by rearomatization of cyclohexyl ring to obtain isoindolinone scaffold by a Pd/Cu dual catalysis approach in an atom economic way with moderate to high yield. The expected Pd/Cu catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8208;H activation via normal catalytic cycle can be override by unusual oxidative dearomatization reaction which has been established by DFT calculation. The biological importance of isoindolinone scaffold insists us to successfully investigate in&#8197;vitro antileishmanial activity of L.Donovani.

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin as Efficient Catalyst for Sonogashira Coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi Type Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been successfully applied as catalyst in Sonogashira coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation reactions, performed under air and copper&#8208;free conditions using very small metal loading (between 0.25 and 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%).







Abstract
A palladium catalyst supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been tested in the Sonogashira coupling reactions of a wide range of aryl iodides and terminal alkynes. The best catalytic performance was obtained at 90&#8201;&#176;C using only 0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;% metal loading under copper&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of a H2O/EtOH (3&#8201;:&#8201;2 v/v) solvent mixture and triethylamine as the base, affording the coupling products in good yields. The Pd/SF&#8208;based protocol was then successfully extended to the synthesis of benzofurans through Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation of 2&#8208;iodophenol with terminal alkynes. Preliminary investigations on the recyclability and the heterogeneous behaviour of the catalyst were performed: hot filtration test and leaching test evidenced the presence of a small amount of soluble active palladium species into the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, Pd/SF could be reused in recharging test and it can be recycled in four consecutive runs with no significant deactivation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>

Five [n,n]&#8208; and [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals with five, six and seven membered rings were prepared by using a formal method from cheap starting materials and reagents and applying simple procedures. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of a more complex spiroacetal, namely the spiro[isobenzofuran&#8208;1,20&#8208;naphtho[1,8b,c]furan] skeleton of the enantiomeric couple oleocaran and elmonin, as an example demonstrating its potential.







Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n=5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n=5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <title>N&#8208;Arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;Diarylphenazines as Tailored Organophotoredox Catalysts for the Reductive Activation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of strongly reducing organophotocatalysts is synthesized and evaluated for the photocatalytic activation of olefins without any sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and suitability as organophotoredox catalysts is investigated using the addition of methanol to a&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The results are supported by spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A small library of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines, N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines has been synthesized as strongly reducing organophotocatalysts without the need for sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and their suitability as organophotoredox catalysts for the efficient activation of olefins was investigated using the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The findings were supported by DFT calculations. Three photocatalysts were identified that allowed quantitative yields with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading and 20&#8197;h irradiation by a 365&#8197;nm LED. The catalyst loading was gradually reduced to 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% and the irradiation time was reduced to only 20&#8197;min. These experiments revealed that N,N&#8208;diisobutyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;amine is the most efficient photocatalyst among the N&#8208;arylphenothiazines. This chromophore combines high electron density introduced by the diisobutylamino phenyl group with high absorptivity at 365&#8197;nm caused by the phenylene bridge to the phenothiazine core. In an attempt to shift the excitation wavelength into the visible light range for selectivity and sustainability purposes (potential use of sunlight as a light source), N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines were designed that exhibit a red&#8208;shifted and broad absorbance shoulder into the visible range, but only N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines allow photocatalysis and the one&#8208;electron activation of alkenes by visible light (450&#8197;nm LED).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover features an abstract representation of two novel, highly reducing organophotocatalysts derived from N&#8208;arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines, compounds widely recognized as versatile and effective photoredox catalysts. The catalysts shown are the most efficient from a library of 17 catalysts synthesized.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) display unique biochemical activities. However, their facile synthesis remains a big challenge due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilicity and alkalinity natures. Recently, the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical process provides a robust tool for various bond formations due to the high reactivity and less sensitive to steric hindrance of radical species. This review summarizes the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 40, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Effect&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Dithioacetal Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for discovering bioactive compounds can be time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive, often requiring extensive synthesis and evaluation. To address these challenges, this study combines TLC&#8208;based assays with dithioacetal mixture&#8208;library preparation, enabling rapid and effective bioactivity screening. Tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin production and fruit browning, serves as a significant therapeutic target in this context. Despite the substantial potential of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in medicinal chemistry, the use of dithioacetals in drug discovery remains limited. In this study, two small libraries of dithioacetals, comprising more than 150 compounds, were prepared as mixture&#8208;libraries and screened on TLC by directly measuring tyrosinase activity on the plate surface. This approach facilitated the efficient preparation and identification of a potent, simple, and readily accessible dithioacetal inhibitor of tyrosinase, with the entire process being conducted on a low milligram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing Chemoselectivity in Alkanolamines: A Panoramic Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review has concentrated on providing a thorough overview of the proposed mechanistic basis of the transformations where the inherent reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8722;O/&#8208;N) have been regulated or reversed to achieve desired chemoselectivity. The factors influencing the activation or deactivation of either functional group, in order to facilitate chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines is also summarised.







Abstract
The most challenging aspect of chemical synthesis has always been attainment of high chemoselectivity levels. This review will provide a panoramic view on how the innate reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8722;O/&#8208;N) can be controlled or reversed for the chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines. A comprehensive compilation of reports encasing various methodologies developed to accomplish selective O/N functionalisation in amino alcohols has been documented. In this review, we go over a number of findings that have been studied in recent decades using a variety of synthetic approaches. To help us organize and emphasize the important ideas that have been emerging as a result of these research, we have concentrated on the suggested mechanistic basis of the reactions that are being surveyed.

         <title>Reassignment of the Structure of Setosol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using computational methods and comparison of reported NMR data, the reported structure of setosol, an unprecedented benzoxonin fungal natural product, is shown to be incorrect. Setosol is shown to be identical to a known but unnamed diaryl ether.







Abstract
By a combination of computational methods and comparison of spectroscopic data, the benzooxonin structure proposed for setosol is shown to be incorrect. The correct structure is that of a known biaryl ether natural product.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Allylic Addition to Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative (deutero)hydroallylation of (hetero)arenes has been realized via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium, thus providing rapid access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. Based on a chiral auxiliary strategy, the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation reaction was also investigated.







Abstract
In comparison with the well&#8208;established allylic additions to C=O, C=N, and C=C double bonds, the dearomative allylic addition to arene &#960;&#8208;systems is heavily underdeveloped due to the severe challenge in breaking aromatic resonance stabilization. Herein, we disclose a general and efficient dearomative allylic addition to chromium&#8208;bound arenes using allylsilanes as the pronucleophiles, thus affording convenient access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. With commercially available deuterium sources, the versatility of this strategy further enables an arene dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuteroallylation with a high level of deuterium incorporation. Finally, a preliminary try on the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation based on a chiral auxiliary strategy is described.

         <title>Ambient Pressure Hydroformylation &#8211; A Key Step to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs is presented. In our previous work, the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes was used to generate an aldehyde from an alkene via rhodium catalysis to be employed in a subsequent tandem reaction to obtain BODIPY dyes. However, the use of higher pressures and therefore autoclaves as well as their necessary equipment might limit others to use this method. The refined approach in this work employs ambient pressure hydroformylation, done in a simple Schlenk tube and using a CO/H2 balloon, as key step towards an easier meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPY synthesis. Additionally, the use of MTBE instead of chloroform as reaction solvent results in a greener approach. Readily available and easily synthesizable alkenes as well as different pyrrole building blocks can be used to extend the range of known alkyl&#8208;BODIPYs. The synthesis of 23 derivatives with overall yields of up to 67% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the refined method.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction Reactions Mediated by Organic Molecules: Recent Advances and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction has emerged as a promising approach, in which organo&#8208;mediators can gain electrons from the electrode to form active intermediates and then efficiently activate the substrates through the electron transfer process. This review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.







Abstract
Electroreduction is an important aspect of organic electrochemistry. Its chemistry does not require the addition of additional reductants, making it an effective alternative to various traditional reduction reactions. Among them, organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction is recognized as a promising approach. Organo&#8208;mediators can be reduced directly at the cathode to form reactive radical anions that subsequently reduce the substrate via electron transfer (ET) to initiate the reaction being investigated. Organo&#8208;mediators typically have a more positive reduction potential, and their role in the whole reaction is similar to that of catalysts. Their addition transforms the ET process from the original heterogeneous process into a homogeneous one. Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction can effectively avoid the over&#8208;electrolysis of the substrate and the product at the electrode and the intolerance of sensitive substrates or functional groups during electrolysis, thereby preventing the occurrence of side reactions. It can also prevent the excessive consumption of reagents and electrical energy while promoting the reaction to achieve higher or completely different selectivity. Considering the advantages of this type of reaction, this review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) Applied to the Synthesis of API Impurities: A Case Study in Oxidative Decarboxylation of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was applied to identify new methodologies to achieve oxidative decarboxylation of arylcarboxylic acids in a rapid and cost&#8208;effective manner. The two oxidant systems discovered (RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 and CAN) were used to obtain a series of popular API impurities, which are essential for impurity profiling during drug development.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) has dramatically impacted experimental reaction development by enabling the rapid exploration of a diverse set of reaction conditions. During the past few decades, HTE has evolved as a tool to expedite reaction discovery and optimization. This work details the application of HTE to synthesize impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ketone/aldehyde functionality, specially focusing on ibuprofen impurity E. Initial experiments using K2S2O8 as oxidant yielded moderate results. Subsequent HTE screens identified cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 as new effective decarboxylative oxidants, with RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) achieving the highest yield of 65&#8201;%. This optimized method was successfully applied to synthesize ibuprofen impurity E on a gram scale. Additionally, the applicability of these methods to obtain other API related substances, such as naproxen impurity L and ketoprofen impurity A, was demonstrated. This research highlights the potential of HTE to streamline the synthesis of API impurities, making them widely accessible for pharmaceutical development purposes.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of Oxindoles and Isoquinolinediones via the Radical Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Monoalkyl Cesium Oxalate Salts by Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylated oxindoles and isoquinolinediones were synthesized by visible light induced radical addition/cyclization reaction of N&#8208;arylacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts. This method does not contain photocatalysts, is easy to operate, and has a wide range of substrates.







Abstract
A photocatalyst&#8208;free cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts is described. In the presence of visible light and (NH4)2S2O8, monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkylated oxindoles. In addition, N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides could be applied for the cascade reaction, providing a series of alkylated isoquinolinediones, which are completely different from the products obtained with monoalkyl oxalates as substrates.

         <title>Silver(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Syntheses of Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After a broad screening of Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids, AgNTf2 was shown to catalyze the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical triarylmethanes (TRAMs) in moderate to excellent yields (30&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 35 examples) with the tolerance of ester and cyano groups.







Abstract
The synthesis of triarylmethanes was evaluated in the presence of various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids under the same stoichiometric conditions. An efficient silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of triarylmethanes is reported. The reaction offers low catalyst loadings and quasi&#8208;stoichiometric conditions (1&#8211;1.2&#8197;equiv. of electrophile) to access to symmetrical and unsymmetrical TRAMs in moderate to excellent yields (35 examples). Broad substrate scope was observed, including compatibility with ester and cyano groups.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Macrocyclization for the Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes: Recent Updates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of catalytic enantioselective macrocyclization for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes is provided. There are three primary methods for accessing these frameworks: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. These methods enable the control of the planar chirality during the macrocycles construction, significantly enhancing the synthesis efficiency. These accomplishments have significant implications for drug discovery, chiral catalysts, and materials science.







Abstract
The planar chirality of macrocycles is a fascinating research topic. Locking the configurational flip between the benzene ring and macrocycle leads to planar chirality, which can significantly enhance the biological activity of cyclophanes. Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes are widely used in pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and functional materials. However, accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes via asymmetric catalysis has remained challenging. Among the various strategies, asymmetric macrocyclization provides a powerful tool for accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes. This method allows for control of the planar chirality when constructing the macrocycle and greatly improves the efficiency. There are three types of macrocyclization reactions: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. In addition, the chiral confinement strategy breaks through conservative synthetic approaches. This review summarizes these achievements, aiming to highlight the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclophanes and inspire interested researchers.

         <title>Denitrative Functionalization of Nitroarenes: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroarenes can be readily synthesized from arenes through direct nitration, and their functionalization via C&#8722;NO2 bond cleavage offers a rapid approach for the modification of arenes. The method not only streamlines the synthetic routes but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;H bonds. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
Nitroarenes are fundamental feedstocks in the chemical industry. Their relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond allows for late&#8208;stage modifications of molecules and exhibits complete orthogonality to the reactivity of C&#8208;halogen bond in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes holds significant appeal due to it avoids the use of aryl halides, thereby simplifying reaction steps and improving atom and step economy. Recent progress in direct denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes includes palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, copper&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, as well as metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot C&#8722;NO2 functionalization. In this review, we provide a concise overview of these advancements, detailing the reaction features and mechanisms. This summary aims to highlight the versatility and efficiency of denitrative functionalization methodologies, offering insights into their potential applications and inspiring further research in this promising area of organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se Bond Formation via Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se bond formations via three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes. Decade developments were categorized into three types, which include (1) C&#8722;S/C&#8722;Se bond formations using radical strategies; (2) Reactions triggered by three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; (3) Reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed conditions and others. Mechanisms have been given for nearly all reactions.







Abstract
Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three&#8208;component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8722;S/S&#8722;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities.

     alt="Recent Developments in C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se Bond Formation via Three-Component Reactions of Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review summarized C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se bond formations via three-component reactions of alkynes. Decade developments were categorized into three types, which include (1) C&#8722;S/C&#8722;Se bond formations using radical strategies; (2) Reactions triggered by three-membered ring intermediates; (3) Reactions under metal-catalyzed conditions and others. Mechanisms have been given for nearly all reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three-component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium-containing compounds. Three-component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8722;S/S&#8722;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco-friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three-membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring-opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal-catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elemental Sulfur Promoted Cyclization of o&#8208;Chloronitrobenzenes and Aryl Isothiocyanates to Furnish 2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to afford 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles often involve the use of o&#8208;aminothiophenols or aniline&#8208;typed precursors. Herein we describe a method to furnish 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles through the cyclization of o&#8208;chloronitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates with the assistance of elemental sulfur. From the perspective of step economy, our strategy allows for the direct use of nitroarene precursors without further reduction to anilines. The scope of the reaction with respect to both substrates was investigated, and it was found that electronic properties of the aryl isothiocyanate was important for obtaining acceptable yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Cascade Radical Cyclization for Difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones were gained through facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol driven by electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes without any extra transition metals or photocatalysts.







Abstract
The research of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex has developed fast in the field of photochemistry. Herein, the green and efficient metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been achieved with 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde and bromodifluoroacetamide, which is driven by noncovalent interactions between 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde/N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) and bromodifluoroacetamide/TMEDA. By precisely optimizing the electron donor and reaction solvent, a wide range of structurally diverse difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones, including aryl amide, aliphatic amide and ester groups, were obtained in up to 76&#8201;% yields. This strategy offers the benefits of simple operation, good yields, high atomic economy and broad applicability, providing an essential complement to traditional approaches for the preparation of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons without any transition metals, photocatalysts or oxidants.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thione Based on [2 + 3] Annulation Trapping of &#945;&#8208;Keto Sulfine with Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2 + 3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in situ&#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3 + 2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8208;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Free Approches to the Direct Arylation of Benzoquinones and Naphthoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylquinones are present in many natural and synthetic molecules. They open up possibilities for application in various areas such as pigments and dyes, optical materials, sensors, pharmaceuticals, etc. Many of the methods to obtain them involve indirect arylation routes of precursors and a chemistry of oxidations, reductions, protection and deprotection of functional groups. In this review, direct arylation methods of quinones are compiled with a focus on processes where no C&#8208;metal bonds are formed, i.&#8201;e., organometallic&#8208;free reactions.







Abstract
Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in&#8197;situ from phenolic precursors.

In this review, direct arylation methods of quinones are compiled with a focus on processes where no C-metal bonds are formed, i.&#8201;e., organometallic-free reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in&#8197;situ from phenolic precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Ditriflates of D&#8208;Glucose in the Synthesis of Iminosugars and Polyhydroxylated Pipecolic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of the iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding pipecolic acid are reported. The key step consists of double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. This is followed by hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides.







Abstract
A synthesis of the five membered iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of the six membered iminosugar 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding sugar imino acid are reported. They involve double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. They are followed by a similar protocol consisting of hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides. This allowed DMJ to be obtained from the cheap sugar D&#8208;glucose.

         <title>Synthesis and EPR Studies of Zinc and Copper Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines (TPMA) Metal Complexes Containing TEMPO Functionalities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines have been used as scaffold for the study of metal organic&#8208;radical interactions using EPR.







Abstract
A new family of stable radical&#8208;containing polytopic ligands based on tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines TPMA architecture and their corresponding metal complexes have been synthesized. These molecular systems offered the possibility to investigate how various spin carriers, such as the metal ion and the organic radical, influence their EPR properties mainly through the empirical ratio of peak heights d1/d. Moreover, it has been possible to analyze how different conformations of TEMPO radical units in the molecular skeleton affect the metallic system.

         <title>Heavy Atom Quantum Tunnelling in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Pentalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy atom quantum tunnelling is the only possible mechanism for the &#960;&#8208;bond shifting of antiaromatic molecules at cryogenic conditions. N&#8208;derivatives of pentalene show a rich range of tunnelling rates for this degenerate rearrangement reaction.







Abstract
Heavy atom quantum tunnelling was already observed in several &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting reactions of antiaromatic molecules. In these, their Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create sharp energy profiles with small atomic trajectories, which are ideal for observing tunnelling. Herein, we studied the effect of the nitrogen in the N&#8208;heterocyclic pentalenes, distinguishing between isothermic and exothermic reactions. The reactivity was not easily predictable, with our computations revealing a wide variability of rates, from the complete cancellation of the barrier to high isomer stability. For all these systems, quantum tunnelling emerged as the most significant mechanism at room temperature and the only valid one at cryogenic conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, also called azoalkenes, have received considerable attention as key synthons for constructing various heterocyclic scaffolds. This minireview summarizes the contribution of our group in this field over the period from 2009 to the present, focusing on the role of the azoene building block in forming the heterocyclic structures.







Abstract
The discovery of structurally unique scaffolds entities with increased complexity and balanced physicochemical properties has the potential to allow synthetic chemists to exploit areas of chemical space that were previously inaccessible. Among the different strategies employed for generating N&#8208;heterocycles, cyclization and cycloaddition reactions represent a valuable synthetic tool. The purpose of this minireview is to summarize the recent advances (2009&#8208;present) from our laboratory on the generation of intriguing five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;heterocyclic architectures (linear, fused and spiro) employing 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) as key synthons.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Thioamides via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic method from amines and boronic acids has been developed to get access to thioamides. The success of this transformation relies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thiocarbamoyl fluorides and boronic acids. This novel reaction feature with good functional group tolerance, mild conditions and providing a variety of thioamides in good yields.







Abstract
A novel and efficient one&#8208;pot method has been developed for the synthesis of thioamides through coupling reactions between thiocarbamoyl fluorides, which are generated in&#8197;situ from amines, and boronic acids. The key to the success of this transformation lies in the use of nickel a catalyst combined with PCy3 as a ligand. This innovative reaction protocol provides mild reaction conditions suitable for producing a diverse array of thioamides, and the late&#8208;stage modification of amoxapine was successfully achieved.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Allylation of Isatin&#8208;Derived Azomethine Imines with Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed umpolung nucleophilic allylation of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine imines with vinylcyclopropanes was developed, affording a wide range of structurally privileged quaternary 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;aminooxindoles in moderate to good yields with excellent linear&#8208;selectivities.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed umpolung allylation of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine imines with vinyl cyclopropanes was disclosed. This protocol provides an efficient and atom&#8208;economic approach to access an array of structurally interesting allylic aminooxindole derivatives in good yields and linear&#8208;selectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield). Further product derivatization and asymmetric catalytic studies proved the practicability of reaction and potential application.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Fluorenes: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched fluorene derivatives have long captivated chemists due to their potential applications in medicinal chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. However, the chiral separation of racemic fluorenes remains the primary method for obtaining these optically pure molecules. This mini&#8208;review summarizes and discusses fifteen years of developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes.







Abstract
The chiral fluorene fragment constitutes one of the most important scaffolds frequently found in numerous bioactive molecules, ligands, and advanced functional materials due to its unique physical properties. In this context, various transition metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions have been developed to prepare chiral fluorenes with high optical purity. In the present mini&#8208;review, we summarize fifteen years of achievements in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes and their derivatives. Particular attention is given to the strategies used and mechanistic aspects of some significant reactions. Moreover, the cutting&#8208;edge developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silafluorenes are also highlighted.

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8208;H or O/N/S&#8208;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Regioselective Tandem Cyclization Protocol to Trifluoromethylated Pyrrolidones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Alkenes via Chalcogen Bond: Chalcogen&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; Bond Catalyzed the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 2&#8208;Vinylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis is a promising catalytic strategy, characterized by its environmental friendliness, relatively inexpensive cost, and similar reactivity to transition metal catalysis. Experimental results suggest that the S&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; and Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonds can efficiently drive the vinyl&#8208;indole&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9395&#8208;9400). In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;vinylindoles has been investigated based on density functional theory. For this reaction, the Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis is as an alternative catalytic strategy. The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction catalyzed by chalcogen bond is stepwise and involves two steps: the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation process and the cyclization process. The cyclization process is the rate&#8208;determining step. From the perspective of energy decomposition analysis, the electrostatic interaction is the main factor to cause Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis, the polarization interaction is the main factor to cause Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis. Additionally, this catalytic reaction involves the endo pathway and exo pathway. The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce-Smiles rearrangement is the rate-determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro-Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce-Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five-membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron-deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce-Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Various Dihydro&#8211;Thiazole and Selenazole Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of thiazole derivatives was achieved by reacting I2/SCN&#8722; with various push&#8208;pull alkenes. The substitution followed by intramolecular cyclization under mild conditions resulted in the desired products. When KSeCN was used, a selenazole derivative was formed.







Abstract
We prepared numerous thiazole derivatives from push&#8208;pull alkenes such as nitroenamines, enaminoester, and enaminonitrils in a two&#8208;step reaction with thiocyanate ion. The first step was the formation of the thiocyanate&#8208;substituted push&#8208;pull alkene from an iodine&#8208;containing intermediary. We demonstrated this sequence through the preparation and identification of the iodine&#8208;substituted enamines. In the second step, thiazole ring closure took place in methanol, at room temperature. The imino group of the condensed thiazole ring systems was successfully acylated. The same reaction sequence with potassium selenocyanate resulted in two selenocyanate and a selenazole heterocyclic derivatives. The mechanism of the reaction with thiocyanate ion and the heterocycle formation was investigated by computational methods. We performed quantum chemical calculations, involving both the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of the ring closure reaction.

         <title>Catalyzing the Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclization Inside Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsules: A Surprising Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect was uncovered, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the number of methylene units present on the linear alkyl chain connected to the resorcin[4]arene derivative.







Abstract
Terpenes, created in Nature via tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene (THT) cyclizations, have long fascinated chemists due to their complex structures and biological activities. Recreating such THT cyclizations in the laboratory using man&#8208;made catalysts has been challenging. Especially difficult is performing the reaction in an enantioselective fashion, as the substrate is flexible and does not contain much functionality to form strong interactions with the chiral catalyst. This study explores the enantioselective THT cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the resorcin[4]arene capsule was uncovered. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an odd&#8208;even effect in the catalyst itself, and also the first instance in which this effect is related to the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Containing Heterocycles from o&#8208;Substituted Aniline Derivatives and Primary Amines by Perylene Diimide Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative cyclization of o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives with primary amines for the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the method used the commercially available organocatalyst PTCDI as a heterogeneous catalyst and can be recycled six times without significant loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
The commercially available 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) acted as a heterogeneous catalyst to catalyze aerobic oxidative synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines from o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives and primary amines in high yields with oxygen as the terminal oxidant. The gram scale reaction and reusability (up to six cycles) of the PTCDI catalyst were also successful and would greatly benefit industrial applications.

This article describes a greener methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of functionalized 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one and their deuterium analogues using an uncatalyzed imine formation&#8208;cyclization approach with good yields on the greenest solvent, water/heavy water. Additionally, we demonstrated the synthetic utility of 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones by reducing the keto and nitro groups.







Abstract
Herein we describe an uncatalyzed and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for the diastereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;nitro dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones through an imine formation&#8208;cyclization reaction on water medium. Water is an essential medium to effect this reaction efficiently without any catalyst. In addition, the synthesis of deuterium labelled 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones has been accomplished using this protocol. The key characteristics of this approach include catalyst free, scalable, mild reaction condition, easy isolation, and greenest solvent medium.

         <title>Utilization of Hypervalent Bonds as a Novel Strategy for Manipulating Energy Levels of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique optical properties created by the combination of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing effects to &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The hypervalent compounds have a narrow energy gap for NIR emission and stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements.







Abstract
The unique optical properties created by the combination of azobenzene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing effects to the directly attached &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The resulting hypervalent compounds have a dramatically narrow energy gap showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission despite the limited size of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. In addition, the hypervalent compounds also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements in both crystals and &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer films. We also explain that the nature of hypervalent bonds depends on the element type, which is particularly effective in bringing out the properties of heavy elements. In this review, we describe that the use of hypervalent bonds is a novel strategy not only for manipulating the energy levels of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system but also for developing a variety of functional materials based on the newly rising properties from hypervalent element.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been estab&#173;lished that multifunctional photoswitches with several norborna&#173;diene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the correspon&#173;ding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;315&#160;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;520 nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lifes of 1 to 2 days. Moreover, the photo&#173;chemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5 + 1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5 + 2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Depending on In/Out Isomerism of Host&#8208;Guest Conjugate Having a Fluorosolvatochromic Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, comprising tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2 and a fluorosolvatochromic dye G1 linked by an oxyethylene chain, was synthesized. HG1 has two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. The two conformations showed different fluorescent colors due to changes in the surrounding environment of the fluorosolvatochromic dye. HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest conjugate is a promising strategy for providing outstanding molecules. Herein, we designed host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, which comprises a hydrophilic host unit, tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2 with a microhydrophobic cavity, and a guest unit, 2,3&#8208;naphthalimide fused with two benzothiophenes G1 exhibiting fluorosolvatochromism, linked with an oxyethylene chain. HG1 initially showed a fluorescence band at 585&#8197;nm in MeOH/H2O (1/499 v/v); however, this band decreased with time, and instead, a new band at 430&#8197;nm appeared. The CIE chromaticity diagram showed that the fluorescent color changed from yellow&#8208;orange to blue via white. NMR analysis of HG1 in methanol&#8208;d4 exhibited different signals of the G1 unit between the blue and yellow fluorescent structures. The blue fluorescent structures showed asymmetrical signals assigned as the G1 unit, affected by the cavity environment of the CPX2 unit. Consequently, HG1 can form two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. In In&#8208;form, the G1 unit is inside the hydrophobic cavity of the CPX2 unit and shows blue fluorescence. In Out&#8208;form, the G1 unit is outside the CPX2 unit and shows yellow fluorescence in an aqueous solvent. Therefore, HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.

A convenient synthetic protocol for diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;ones with high diastereoselectivity is developed by base promoted domino annulation reaction of MBH carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The relative configurations of the various polycyclic compounds are clearly elucidated by determination eight single crystal structures.







Abstract
The diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;one scaffolds were conveniently synthesized by base promoted domino cyclization reaction of MBH (Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillmann) carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The base promoted reactions of MBH maleimides of isatins and MBH formates of isatins with 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones afforded polycyclic dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8242;&#8208;benzofuro[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:1,5]cyclopenta[1,2&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;5&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] and dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in good yields and with high diastereoselectivity. More importantly, DMAP facilitated annulation reaction of MBH nitriles of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones selectively resulted in dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopentane&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines], while Cs2CO3 promoted reaction gave dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The relative configurations of the various polycyclic compounds were clearly elucidated by determination several single crystal structures.

         <title>Toward Multi&#8208;Functionalized Organogermaniums: Diastereoselective Transformations of Germacycles Derived from Cheletropic Reactions of Boron&#8208;Substituted Butadienes with Ge(II) Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (4+1) cycloadditions of the boron&#8208;substituted butadienes with Ge(II) salts afforded the carbon&#8208;based germacycles. The obtained germacycles behaved as allylboronic nucleophiles and were applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enabled access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.







Abstract
The field of organogermanium in chemistry has recently attracted attention. Thanks to the inherent features of germanium (Ge), introducing Ge&#8208;based substituents into organic frameworks has enhanced bioactivity and optoelectronic properties of molecules. Herein, the synthesis of multi&#8208;functionalized organogermaniums using Ge(II) salts is reported. The germacycles having an allylboron moiety, which is derived from the (4+1) cycloadditions of the butadienes bearing a boronic ester moiety with Ge(II) salts, can be applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enable access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.

         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective cyclopropanation of nitrile&#8208;stabilized quaternary ammonium ylide with a weakly activated conjugated carboxamide functional motif is reported, which provides an efficient access to biologically relevant spiro&#8208;cyanocyclopropane oxindoles, while sigmatropic rearrangement process of the ylide is commonly known.







Abstract
Nitrile&#8208;stabilized quaternary ammonium ylide as an effective aryl&#8208;cyanomethylene transfer agent has been explored for the first time, which enables a spirocyclopropanation process with conjugated carboxamide of indole heterocycle. The developed In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed method provides a straightforward, diastereoselective access to pharmaceutically relevant spiro&#8208;cyclopropane&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton assembled with an &#945;&#8208;cyano and two (hetero)aromatic substitutions. The common difficulties of a cyclopropanation process, e.&#8201;g., a conjugated carboxamide as valid substrate, cleavage&#8208;susceptibility of amide bond, substrates scope limited to preferentially electron&#8208;withdrawing group containing molecules, and the competing dehydrocyanation reaction of product generated from nitrile&#8208;stabilized ylide have been overcome in the present spirocyclopropanation process.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced and PIFA Enabled [4+2] Annulation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aryl Substituted Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a visible&#8208;light irradiation and PIFA oxidized [4+2] annulation of alkenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids as the amidoxyl radical precursors was report. The reaction provides a new approach toward ben&#8208;zo[c][1,2]oxazines. A series of alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids worked well under the reaction conditions, affording the desired products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this paper, we reported a facile approach for the preparation of benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffolds via visible light induced phenyl iodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) oxidative [4+2] annulation of vinyl benzenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids. In the transformation, amidoxyl radicals are readily generated via covalent I&#8722;O bond formation and photo&#8208;induced I&#8722;O cleavage from N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids, and their coupling with vinyl arenes in the form of [4+2] annulation delivers benzo[c]&#8208;[1,2]oxazines derivatives. This reaction proceeds in the absence of transition metals and catalysts, exhibiting broad substrate scope of both alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids.

         <title>Tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;Aldol Cyclization Towards Di and Trisubstituted Pyridines: Use of Malonaldehyde and Diethyl Malonate for the Synthesis of Indolizine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective method for synthesizing multi&#8208;functionalized indolizine via tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization, yielding a scaffold with a C6 hydroxy group and a C7 ethyl ester/aldehyde group under mild conditions with excellent efficiency.







Abstract
An effective method for the construction of a multi&#8208;functionalized pyridine motif of indolizine using the [4+2] annulation pathway involves tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization as a critical step in the process. The production of an indolizine scaffold with a hydroxy group at the C6 position and an ethyl ester/aldehyde group at the C7 position was successfully accomplished using this approach with an excellent yield, with the use of a reagent that contains active methylene and operates under mild conditions. This straightforward and simple protocol allows extensions of the core moiety in a quick and dependable manner.

         <title>Characterization and Optimization of the Photoluminescent Properties of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have investigated the relationship between imidazole ring substitution in the R2&#8208;position and the blue photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines in more detail. For this purpose, a four&#8208;step synthesis was implemented and findings from previous work were extended upon. This allowed us to identify an advantageous substitution pattern to optimize the quantum yield in solution and in solid phase.

In our previous work we could show, that Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines are compounds with interesting optical properties. In this work, we optimized the photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines by following outlined trends in our previous work. By introducing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor residual groups on the imidazole ring, the quantum yield (QY) could be significantly increased. This indicated a clear advantageous substitution pattern for this system. In addition, cyclic voltammetric and UV/vis measurements in solid state lay the foundation for applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have investigated the relationship between imidazole ring substitution in the R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-position and the blue photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5-a]quinolines in more detail. For this purpose, a four-step synthesis was implemented and findings from previous work were extended upon. This allowed us to identify an advantageous substitution pattern to optimize the quantum yield in solution and in solid phase.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;Type Reactions: Challenges and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold, in contrast to other transition metals, offers a unique reactivity profile and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This review will focus on recent advances in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, particularly those facilitated by photocatalysts and ligand design.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki and Heck reactions are two of the most common carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions. Gold, unlike other transition metals (Pd, Ni, and Cu), offers unique reactivity profiles, and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This mini&#8208;review focused on the recent work in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, especially by photocatalysts or ligand design, which show reactivities and features distinct from other transition metals. These discoveries will further facilitate the development of gold redox catalysis as well as applications in organic synthesis, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Functionalized Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Porous Organic Polymers (FPPOPs) &#8208;Promoted Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel porous organic polymers (POPs) that exhibited tunable and hyper&#8208;crosslinked, regular pore sizes and abundant micro/mesoporous structure, were prepared from co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) and vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3), and it possessed excellent performance in the enhancement of chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes.







Abstract
The development of novel catalyst systems, especially as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation reaction of hydrosilanes is highly desirable. Herein, we developed a simple and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for construction of functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (FPPOPs) and its heterogeneous palladium catalyst through anchoring on FPPOPs bearing a phosphine ligand, in which the fabrication of FPPOPs was completed through the vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3) and vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (ViPOSS) as well as functional olefins via radical co&#8208;polymerization. All these FPPOPs could act as a phosphine ligand for Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes have been characterized by SEM, FTIR, and X&#8208;RAD. Moreover, the POSS&#8208;based functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (POSS&#8208;PPOPs) proved to be a high efficiency catalyst system for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation of hydrosilanes with aryl iodides and with good yields as well as excellent chemoselectivity with low amount of catalyst under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non&#8208;covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic mechanistic study employing&#160;kobs&#160;kineticsmeasurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) / H2O in 50 % MeCN / CH2Cl2&#160;at 25.0 &#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961; = &#8208;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2&#160;and 4&#8208;NO2&#160;substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in situ from TCCA and the benzyl alcohol, as the actual oxidizing species. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2&#160;in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract
A family of N,N&#180;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70%&#8722;92% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70%&#8722;93% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the &#8208;C(O)Ar unit in N&#8208;aroylguanidines contain 2&#8208;aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A binary mixture of organic salts, also known as ionic liquids, [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] denoted as BmIL1 has been ex&#8208;plored as bifunctional catalyst for the selective synthesis of 2 &#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions. The methodology has been extended to the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones via another pathway from different precursors under the same catalytic system. Greener synthesis of existing drugs reestablished the multifunctionality of BmIL1. Gram scale synthesis of both the products, DFT calculations and sc&#8208;XRD data add significance to the developed protocol. Moreover, high atom economy and eco&#8208;scale values justify the sustainability of the methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Atom Transfer Radical Addition of CBr4 onto Alkenes as a Key Step for Their Conversion to Propargylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the radical anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of CBr4 onto various alkenes has been developed, using phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator, leading to the desired products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The conversion of the produced 1,1,1,3&#8208;tetrabromo derivatives to secondary or tertiary propargylamines in two steps has been demonstrated.







Abstract
&#913; green and sustainable metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of carbon tetrabromide onto alkenes was developed. Phenylglyoxylic acid was employed as the photoinitiator to promote the water&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov photochemical addition. A vast variety of alkenes was employed successfully, providing the corresponding products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The photochemical protocol found an application towards the three&#8208;step synthesis of secondary or tertiary propargylamines starting from alkenes.

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3'&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8208;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;Fluoro Analogues of Febrifugine and Halofuginone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel synthesis of racemic cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight&#8208;forward seven&#8208;step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination&#8208;allylation sequence&#160;generating&#160;a mixture of N&#8208;Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation&#8208;methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the N&#8208;Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the cis&#8208;diastereomer favours a conformation where the F&#8208;atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its trans&#8208;stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2&#8208;substituent overrides any F&#8208;atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO&#8208;d6 and as their free&#8208;bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65:35 ratio of trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the trans&#8208;isomer was 94.3&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1, whereas for the cis&#8208;isomer it was 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of Nmethylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.</dc:description>

Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well-established (thio)urea analogues and related H-bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have realized the photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction, enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures and excellent yields.&#160;Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst load, strong regional control and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by the density functional theory calculations.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8211;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.</dc:description>

Isocoumarins by Ring Transformation: The cyanide catalyzed ring transformation of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester is the key transformation for the preparation of an optically active isocoumarin derivative.







Abstract
A four step sequence for the preparation of optically active (R,R)&#8208;ethyl 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate is reported. In the first step the first stereocenter was installed by palladium catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of PhB(OH)2 to indenone (88&#8201;% ee). After deprotonation, the ester moiety was introduced with Mander's reagent. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the resulting &#946;&#8208;oxoester was then achieved with cerium&#8208;catalysis under an air atmosphere. Key transformation was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester furnishing the &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety of the target compound, which was formed as a mixture of separable cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereoisomers, both with 88&#8201;% ee. The cis&#8208;isomer could be epimerized to the trans&#8208;compound. The relative trans and the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration of the target compound was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Tris(3&#8208;Pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1, 3, 5&#8208;Triazine Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) and tris(BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold were synthesized over a sequence of steps and our spectral and theoretical studies supported the presence of excitonic interactions between the fluorophores in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) whereas the tris(BODIPY) did not show such interactions.







Abstract
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine tris(p&#8208;oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;tris(meso&#8208;p&#8208;oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et3N/BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 afforded fluorescent tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods. Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, and transient&#8208;absorption studies revealed that in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.

     alt="Synthesis and Properties of Tris(3-Pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1, 3, 5-Triazine Scaffold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) and tris(BODIPY) on 1,3,5-triazine scaffold were synthesized over a sequence of steps and our spectral and theoretical studies supported the presence of excitonic interactions between the fluorophores in tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) whereas the tris(BODIPY) did not show such interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5-triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p-hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5-triazine tris(p-oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5-triazine-tris(meso-p-oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso-oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded fluorescent tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso-oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods. Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and transient-absorption studies revealed that in tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails a one&#8208;pot, cascade carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Bronsted acid and a ligand source at the in situ generated I(III) centre. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors. Mechanistic studies were carried out, and the synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated for the synthesis of the benzothiazole&#8208;based antitumor drug GW&#8208;610.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: A series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars were synthesized by one&#8208;pot stereoselective three&#8208;component reactions of D&#8208;ribose tosylate, aniline and cycloenones under heating conditions. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. In this way, various novel complex fused iminosugars were obtained through a normal Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism at 80 &#176;C.

         <dc:description>Reactions of 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides with enol diazoacetates were studied. A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates. Use of Rh2(Oct)4 (2 mol.%) leads to chemoselective [3+3]&#8208;annulation producing 1,2&#8208;oxazine&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives. With lower catalyst loadings (0.03 mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategy for C&#8211;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarized a strategy for C&#8211;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field. Cubane, known as a bioisostere of benzene ring, and its functionalization hold significant potential for future drug development. However, owing to its highly strained and thermodynamically unstable nature, the methodologies are limited and their precise and diverse functionalization is challenging in current organic chemistry. In this Concept, we categorized and explained these methodologies, which represents a majority of current cubane C&#8211;H functionalization. In addition, we discussed recent advancements in catalytic C&#8211;H functionalization methods, demonstrating their potential to address these challenges effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A new CuI/oxalamide catalytic system for the large&#8208;scale aerobic oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8208;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100 mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A Convergent, thiol&#8208; and metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives were developed from readily available precursors such as aryl ketone, aromatic amine and elemental sulfur. This reaction involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and one new C&#8722;N bond in single step employing environmentally benign iodine as the catalyst. Photophysical properties like quantum yield, solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission were also explored. Moreover, HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap was calculated for few compounds which suggests the possibility of Intramolecular charge transfer.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of 2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;one was achieved via iodine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and a C&#8722;N bond from the readily available precursors &#8208; aryl methyl ketones, p&#8208;anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields. As the synthesized benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;ones are fluorescent under UV light, photophysical properties like solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE), and the relative quantum yields of the compounds were measured which proves them to be a potential candidate for the development of optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A Convergent, thiol- and metal-free strategy for the synthesis of benzothiazine-2-one derivatives were developed from readily available precursors such as aryl ketone, aromatic amine and elemental sulfur. This reaction involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and one new C&#8722;N bond in single step employing environmentally benign iodine as the catalyst. Photophysical properties like quantum yield, solid-state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission were also explored.

&lt;p&gt;A convergent synthesis of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]thiazin-2-one was achieved &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; iodine-catalyzed three-component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and a C&#8722;N bond from the readily available precursors - aryl methyl ketones, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields.

         <title>A Supramolecular Gel that Exhibits Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsiveness and High Conductivity Through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;Ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed to the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases via the syn conformation in DNA.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines or N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole using 2&#8208;methylquinoline or 2&#8208;methylbenzo[d]thiazole, arylamines, and &#945;&#8208;ketoesters was developed. The methyl group of methyl aza&#8208;arenes incorporated in the Povarov reaction via an iodination/Kornblum oxidation sequence. This method was achieved through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process without the need for transition metals, demonstrating excellent scalability in synthesis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation/Heck reaction/esterification is demonstrated for the efficient construction of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;ketoesters in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner. The developed method features exceptionally broad substrate scope, good functional&#8208;group compatibility, and straightforward scale&#8208;up as well as versatility.







Abstract
A facile palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation/Heck reaction/esterification has been developed. A large variety of alcohols and phenols were all tolerated well to access a series of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;ketoesters in moderate to good yields, broadening the application of carbonylation. The current research exhibits broad substrate scope, good functional&#8208;group compatibility and straightforward scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium in Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis: Unique Reactivity, Mechanisms and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged as a prominent research area in modern organic synthesis and environmental science. As an important transition metal, chromium has garnered widespread attention in the field of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis in recent years, primarily manifested in the following aspects: a) the unique photochemical properties of chromium(III) complexes endow them with longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes and higher reactivities; b) by harnessing visible light to induce single&#8208;electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer to generate radicals, which subsequently form alkyl&#8208;chromium(III) intermediates with chromium(II) ligands, these intermediates can selectively attack electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of target products; c) following metals like cerium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and bismuth, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction pathways in chromium photocatalysis have also been extensively investigated.This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their unique reactivity, mechanisms, and future directions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines, yielding the corresponding&#160;secondary alcohols and secondary amines&#160;under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of sulfoCy5&#8208; and sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8211;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8211;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer&#8208;indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion Of N&#8208;Troponyl&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives Into Cationic Troponyl&#8208;Oxazolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole and benzoxazolidine are constituents of various bioactive natural/synthetic molecules comprising benzenoid aromatic residue. However, non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffolds such as tropone and tropolone are also found in natural products. This report describes the synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8208;1.2 V. Hence, cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidinyl amino acids/peptides could be promising analogs of benzoxazolidine for the development of therapeutic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Divinylbenzene Co&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker in &#160;a&#160;Threefold Cross&#8208;Linked Polystyrene&#8208;Phosphine Hybrid Monolith: Impact of Cross&#8208;Linking Degree on Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow organic transformations using immobilized catalysts are crucial for green and sustainable chemistry. Cross&#8208;linked polymer ligands offer high stability, ease of recovery through filtration, and thus enhance performance in continuous&#8208;flow reactions via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Additionally, the cross&#8208;linking structure of the polymer support creates a unique reaction platform that controls the coordination behavior of the supported ligands and stabilizes the metal catalysts. However, insights into the material&#8208;based design for preparing highly active and durable immobilized metal catalysts are still limited. In this report, we propose a straightforward approach to boost both selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of metal complexes. We developed threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths with cross&#8208;linking structures adjusted by varying the content of divinylbenzene as co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker. The coordination behaviors and metal&#8208;support interactions of these monoliths were evaluated, highlighting the importance of co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker content in site&#8208;isolating phosphine units and stabilizing metal centers via arene&#8208;metal interactions on the polystyrene network. By optimizing the cross&#8208;linking structure, the monolith catalysts demonstrated exceptionally high catalytic activity and durability in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;Cl transformations, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations in continuous flow.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;fluorocyclopropane &#946;&#8208;lactams with activity against Mycobacteroides abscessus and Mycobacterium bovis BCG</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2&#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39 mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, the first mechanochemical asymmetric Robinson annulation reaction was reported and chiral 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this method. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Ketones and Aldimines with Ammonia Borane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenation of organic compounds employing low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalysts is highly desirable as the corresponding hydrogenated products have significant importance in pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industries. Herein, a cobalt(II) complex supported by &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand has been easily prepared by treatment of anhydrous CoCl2 with diimine, which can catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated bond with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. A variety of ketones and aldimines bearing diverse functional groups can be reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines in moderate to excellent yields at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that several readily reducible functional groups such as nitro and cyano are tolerated under the standard reaction conditions. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reaction has been successfully carried out and the procedure could be handled easily, which both make this methodology general and practical.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes assisted by a strong coordinating 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group has been demonstrated. The protocol exhibits good substrate scope and selectivity. Substrate diversification and mechanistic investigations were carried out for the reaction. A plausible mechanism was also proposed based on the mechanistic investigation performed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. A bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group was utilized for the regioselective &#947;&#8208;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H functionalization of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. This protocol exhibits wide substrate scope and good selectivity. Additionally, substrate diversification was performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol. Mechanistic investigations were carried out to provide an insight to the reaction mechanism. A plausible mechanism was also proposed for the present methodology.

         <title>Continuous Flow Spirocyclization Reactions: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Spiropenicillanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a continuous flow approach to chiral spiropenicillanates with remarkable bioactive properties from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates via phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with diphenyldiazomethane.
Model reactions were carried out using simple alkenes, such as methyl vinyl ketone and&#160;N&#8208;substituted maleimides, leading to the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 96%). The [3+2] annulation reaction was subsequently extended to the reactivity of 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates, a more complex 2&#960;&#8208;component with an exocyclic carbon&#8208;carbon double bond, allowing the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds. Two regioisomeric chiral spirocyclopentene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams were obtained, in moderate to good overall yields (31&#8208;84%). The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions between 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates and diphenyldiazomethane under continuous flow conditions&#160;gave the corresponding spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates in high yields (up to 81%).&#160;Thermal ring contraction, via N2&#160;extrusion, of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates under continuous&#160;flow conditions led&#160;to spirocyclopropanepenicillanates in quantitative yields.&#160;
The continuous flow proved to be an efficient methodology for the synthesis of&#160;spiropenicillanates and represents&#160;a more sustainable approach for the scale&#8208;up synthesis of spiropenicillanates with relevant biological activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization and thiocarbonylation reaction has been disclosed for the synthesis of thioesters&#8208;containing benzofurans. By using S&#8208;aryl thioformates as efficient and convenient thioester surrogates, a variety of thioesters&#8208;functionalized benzofurans are formed in moderate to excellent yields with very good functional group tolerance. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and no manipulation of toxic CO gas and odorous thiols.</dc:description>

         <title>[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions to Corannulene Accelerated by &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of Ru complexes to corannulene increases substantially its reactivity as a dienophile in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions because of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering effect. Lowering of the repulsive Pauli repulsion term is driven by the charge transfer from the corannulene to the metal moiety.







Abstract
The influence of different (LRu)nII (L=Cp&#8211; (n=1, 2); C6H6) moieties &#951;6&#8208;coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)+, (Benzene)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)+, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of o&#8208;Iodoanilines with Acrylates or Acrylic Acids: A Convenient One&#8208;Step Route to 2&#8208;Quinolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient method is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones from o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize redox&#8208;neutral base. The reaction mechanism involving a Heck coupling intermediate is well investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and general method for the construction of 2&#8208;quinolinones was developed in this paper. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of various o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids proceeded smoothly to produce 2&#8208;quinolinones in 28&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% yields. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize suitable base, such as potassium pivalate and potassium acetate. Various synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro groups, remained intact during the reaction. The effects of catalyst and base on this cyclization reaction and kinetic experiments were investigated to understand the aspect of the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Product&#8208;like Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/Shikimic Acid Hybrid Analogues with Anti&#8208;osteoclastogenic Activity via Photo&#8208;Nazarov Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to the construction of novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited&#8208;state photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole. And the yield of (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;product was up to 91% after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues exhibit potent RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities, which suggests promising prospect of the novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti&#8208;osteoporosis drug development.</dc:description>
