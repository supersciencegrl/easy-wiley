         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

The Front Cover illustrates the action of a cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent probe inside a hypoxic A549 cell. Nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of hypoxia, transforms a carboxylic ester group on the central heptamethine chain through a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism into a brightly fluorescent carboxylate group, resulting in a &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescent response.

         <title>Biocatalytic kinetic resolution to access enantiomerically enriched dihydropyrimidinone/thiones via recognition of a remote stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from  Candida antarctica  . Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8208;5 bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient construction of quaternary carbon center is a formidable challenging task due to their enhanced structural complexity. Although the catalytic  gem&#8208;  difunctionalization of  &#945;  &#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds via metal&#8208;carbenoids is a well&#8208;documented, developing new methods to access quaternary carbon centers which are difficult or unattainable in monocatalysis is highly desirable. Dual catalysis where two different catalysts work concurrently has emerged as a powerful strategy to achieve new reactivity and selectivity. In this minireview, we highlight the recent advances in cooperative Rh(II)/Pd(0) dual catalysis for the constructions of quaternary carbon centers, focusing on the synthetic utility of stable  &#945;  &#8208;diazo&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto&#8208;esters and allylic carboxylates. Additionally, several challenging asymmetric Rh(II)/Pd(0) dual&#8208;catalyzed transformations generating chiral quaternary carbon centers are also discussed.</dc:description>

The influence of substitution of oxygen for sulfur at the 3&#8208;position of 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;protected mannopyranosyl thioglycosides shows considerable protecting group&#8208;dependent variation. Notably, a 3&#8208;S&#8208;picolyl ester is &#945;&#8208;directing, which contrasts with the &#946;&#8208;directing effect of the corresponding 3&#8208;O&#8208;picolyl system. Activation of 3&#8208;S&#8208;picolinyl substituted system leads to the isolation of a stable seven&#8208;membered bridged bicyclic pyridinium ion.







Abstract
The influence on glycosyl selectivity of substituting oxygen for sulfur at the 3&#8208;position of 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;protected mannopyranosyl thioglycosides is reported and varies considerably according to the protecting group employed at the 3&#8208;position. The substitution of a thioether at the 3&#8208;position for the more usual 3&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl ether results in a significant loss of selectivity. The installation of a 3&#8208;S&#8208;picolinyl thioether results in a complex reaction mixture, from which a stable seven&#8208;membered bridged bicyclic pyridinium ion is isolated, while the corresponding 3&#8208;O&#8208;picolinyl ether affords a highly &#945;&#8208;selective coupling reaction. A 3&#8208;O&#8208;picolyl ester provides excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity, while the analogous 3&#8208;S&#8208;picolyl thioester gives a highly &#945;&#8208;selective reaction. The best &#946;&#8208;selectivity is seen with a 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyldisulfanyl) system. These observations are discussed in terms of the influence of the various substituents on the central glycosyl triflate &#8211; ion pair equilibrium.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirocyclopentane Oxindoles Bearing Five Consecutive Stereocenters through Secondary Amine&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functionalized spirocyclopentane oxindoles represent the characteristic structural core in ubiquitous bioactive compounds. However, the enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindole&#8208;fused cyclopentanes containing five adjacent stereocenters is rare in the literature. Here, a secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between C3&#8208;substituted oxindoles and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to afford highly functionalized spirocyclopentaneoxindole derivatives bearing five consecutive stereocenters is reported.







Abstract
This work delineates a Michael&#8208;initiated ring&#8208;closing [3+2] cycloaddition of newly designed 3&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. During the chiral secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, highly functionalized spirocyclopentane oxindole derivatives containing five consecutive stereogenic centers were formed, two of which were tetrasubstituted carbon. All the desired products are smoothly obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr). Meanwhile, the practicality of this strategy was highlighted by the further gram&#8208;scale experiment and a set of synthetic transformations.

         <title>Dithiocyanation of Alkynes with N&#8208;Thiocyanato&#8208;dibenzenesulfonimide and Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrophilic/nucleophilic dithiocyanation of alkynes with N&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;dibenzenesulfonimide (NTSI) and NH4SCN has been demonstrated. The protocol features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction condition, and high yields.







Abstract
Organic thiocyanates widely exist in natural products, and act as important precursors for organic synthesis. An efficient dithiocyanation of alkynes with N&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;dibenzenesulfonimide (NTSI) as the SCN+ cation and ammonium thiocyanate as the SCN&#8208; anion sources has been developed. Highly active electrophilic reagent NTSI could react with various types of alkynes to build C(sp2)&#8722;SCN bond to provide a variety of dithiocyanato olefin compounds under simple and mild conditions. Trace amount of water is beneficial to the dissociation of ammonium thiocyanate, which makes the SCN&#8208; anion easier to participate in the reaction. The protocol owns a broad substrates scope including terminal and internal, alkyl and aryl alkynes, excellent functional group tolerance and good regioselectivity.

         <title>Dibenzothiazepine Based MCR Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and facile two&#8208;step access towards complex, polycyclic dibenzothiazepine derivatives via multicomponent reaction chemistry is demonstrated. The peculiar butterfly conformation is observed and studied.







Abstract
Privileged scaffolds which can unveil unknown territories of the chemical space are constantly prominent. As such, 1,5&#8208;dibenzothiazepines not only offer structural diversification but also a very unique binding mode due to their &#8220;butterfly&#8221; conformation. We provide MCR&#8208;based annulations of this scaffold towards three different tetracycles in a straightforward, two&#8208;step procedure. We synthesize a library of 30 tetracyclic 1,5&#8208;tetrazolo&#8208;, fused imidazo&#8208; and lactam&#8208;1,5&#8208;dibenzothiazepines with scalable and one&#8208;pot procedures. In addition, we obtained single crystal structures of certain derivatives, demonstrating the conformational behavior of the scaffold.

Abstract
This paper reports a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced difunctionalization of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and peroxides for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydrofurans under mild reaction conditions with good yields in most cases. The multicomponent reaction exhibits excellent site&#8208;selectivity of carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran (exclusive anti&#8208;addition), good functional group tolerance, and high diastereoselectivity (d.r. &gt;99&#8201;%).

         <title>Enantioselective Fluorescent Recognition of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols by Stereoselective Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent probe shows highly enantioselective fluorescence enhancement with various &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, which can be used to determine their enantiomeric composition. A stereoselective double nucleophilic addition of an amino alcohol to the two aldehyde groups of the probe could generate a structurally rigid macrocycle to give the greatly enhanced fluorescence.







Abstract
2,2&#8217;&#8208;Diformyl&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl is found to exhibit highly enantioselective fluorescence enhancement in the presence of various &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols and base. It provides a new method to determine the enantiomeric composition of those substrates and has potential for high throughput analysis. Based on detailed spectroscopic analyses, it is proposed that a stereoselective cyclization of a &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol with the probe should occur to form a rigid macrocyclic intermediate, contributing to the greatly enhanced fluorescence.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

         <title>Homogeneous Systems Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes for Photoactivated CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates, inspired by nature, the photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction which has a high potential for a successful transition towards renewable energy sources and decreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. In artificial systems, new photosensitizers and catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals should combine high efficiency and low environmental footprint. Photoinduced e&#8208; transfer processes reduce CO2 into valuable chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methane. More information can be found in the Review by C. Bizzarri.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover represents light as a multi&#8208;tool, where each tool is a specific property of light, such as intensity or color. In photocatalysis, light can be used to control the activity and selectivity of a chemical reaction by choosing a suitable &#8220;light tool&#8221;. Control over photon flux and wavelength allows for multi&#8208;photon excitation and chromoselective reactions. More information can be found in the Review by Y. Markushyna and A. Savateev.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Benzothiazole&#8208;based Isosorbide Imidates by Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;promoted regiodivergent protocol for  exo  (2&#8208;OH) and  endo  (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates synthesis is described. The disclosed strategy allows the straightforward synthesis of monoimidate&#8208;isosorbides (MIIs) endowed with the biologically relevant benzothiazole (BTA) moiety under mild oxidative conditions, starting from easy&#8208;accessible aldimines. Process optimization encompassed the use of stoichiometric diquinone as well as atmospheric oxygen as oxidant species, focusing on reaction dichotomy between oxidative and oxygenative pathways. The reaction scope was investigated on a representative selection of BTA&#8208;containing aldimines and further extended to congeners bearing different biologically pivotal  N  &#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole), observing good levels of yield (up to 87%) and regioselectivity (  exo  /  endo  up to 10.0;  endo  /  exo  up to 7.0). Furthermore, the employment of an immobilized&#8208;NHC under heterogeneous conditions was assessed, showing satisfactory selectivity towards  exo  &#8208;MIIs (  exo  /  endo  = 3.8). Overall, the methodology presented provided an unprecedented collection of high value&#8208;added products with potential applications in different fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Dual Amine/Transition Metal Catalysis &#8208; Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual Catalysis has enabled a plethora of novel unconventional transformations that would have been unattainable by either catalyst alone. The enormous potential of dual catalysis hinges on the synergistic activation of two substrates in discrete catalytic cycles without interfering with one another. The last decade had witnessed diverse dual&#8208;catalyst systems focusing mainly on the combination of transition metal catalysis with either one of Lewis acid catalysis, photoredox catalysis, biocatalysis or organocatalysis (i.e., Lewis bases, Br&#248;nsted acids and NHC catalysts). In this setting, the scientific community has greatly embraced the integration of amine catalysts with transition metal catalysts. This mini&#8208;review comprehends the reported examples from the past decade on dual amine/transition metal catalysis and discuss the various activation modes for the functionalisation of carbonyl compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxamates derived from 3&#8208;sulfolene&#8208;3&#8209;carboxylic acid can be involved in intra&#8208; and intermolecular rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed heteroannulations with alkynes proceeding via C(sp 2 )&#8211;H bond activation. These transformations allow a straightforward access to diversely substituted pyridones, and to pyridines fused to a sulfolene ring after functional group transformations. Subsequent cheletropic elimination of sulfur dioxide can be achieved under microwave irradiation to generate pyridine ortho &#8208;quinodimethanes. These results demonstrate that the scope of rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp 2 )&#8211;H functionalizations can be extended to sulfolenes, a yet unexplored class of alkenes in these latter transformations, thereby affording access to valuable classes of heterocyclic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY = 73% &#8208; 100%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY = 14% &#8211; 59%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

C&#8722;H functionalization opens a convenient pathway to N&#8208;substituted benzo[4,5]thiazolo[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,4]triazol&#8208;1&#8208;ium salts. Using this procedure, tricyclic thiazolium salts containing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating aromatic substituents as well as aliphatic substituents can be synthesized.







Abstract
Herein we report a generally applicable method for the preparation of N&#8208;substituted benzo[4,5]thiazolo[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,4]triazol&#8208;1&#8208;ium salts from air stable precursors. This transformation features selective deprotection of a para&#8208;methoxybenzyl protected thiol followed by C&#8722;H functionalization of the linked 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts under oxidative conditions. Using this procedure, we synthesized a variety of tricyclic thiazolium salts which contain both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating aromatic substituents as well as aliphatic substituents. Our approach also tolerates many functional groups including alkynes, alcohols, diols, amides, and polyethers.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for the hydroxylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes was developed. The transformation relies on the anodic oxidation of arene and the use trifluoroacetic acid as an oxygen source. The reaction is carried out in an electrochemical flow reactor, which allowed to synthesize sensitive products by shortening reaction/residence time to 1.25&#8197;minutes and to perform a scale up experiment.







Abstract
Electrochemical hydroxylation of arenes by trifluoroacetic acid provides a straightforward access to aryl oxygen compounds under the mild and environmental benign reaction conditions. Harmful and pollutant stoichiometric amounts of oxidation reagents and the use of metal&#8208;catalysts can be avoided. Herein, we present a novel method for the synthesis of hydroxylated products from electron&#8208;rich arenes that was achieved by the implementation of a continuous&#8208;flow setup. The continuous nature of the process allowed to fine&#8208;tune the reactions conditions in order to prevent the decomposition of the sensitive products expanding the reaction scope beyond electron&#8208;poor and neutral arenes that were previously reported in the batch processes. Thus, synthetically valuable hydroxylated arenes were obtained in good yields with the residence time just over a minute. In order to demonstrate the reliability and the efficiency of the electrochemical flow setup, a scale up experiment was also performed.

         <title>Dual Photoredox and Cobalt Catalysis Enabled Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Review systematically summarizes the recent advances in the field of dual photoredox and cobalt catalyst in organic transformations. Detailed mechanistic studies and future prospects in this emerging field are emphasized.







Abstract
Dual photoredox and cobalt catalysis opens a new and exciting avenue for transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The ability of this approach to access low valent cobalt species gives enormous opportunity to develop reactions that relies on stoichiometric methods. In this mini review, we have compiled the most recent development of this dual catalytic system with particular attention paid to the mechanistic details and substrate scope. We hope that this review will be useful for synthetic organic chemists and further stimulate the advancement of more novel strategies.

         <title>Chromanone Lactones: A Neglected Group of Natural Products &#8211; Isolation, Structure Elucidation, Bioactivity, and Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromanone lactones are a group of fungal natural products that previously have only been described as derivatives from other compounds like chromanones or tetrahydroxanthones. A new classification for this family of compounds is presented, and their isolation, structural elucidation, bioactivity and total synthesis are being reviewed since their first isolation up to date.







Abstract
Chromanone lactones are a diverse family of fungal metabolites, which is biologically linked to tetrahydroxanthones. These compounds exhibit different structures that could be monomeric or dimeric, with different linkages and in combination with other monomers, but also fused to give more complex structures. They have been neglected so far, as they have not been recognized as an original group of natural products and as most of the publications related to these compounds have arisen only since the beginning of the century. In this Review, we discuss the isolation, the structural elucidation, the bioactivity and also the synthesis of chromanone lactones. Moreover, we present a classification of the different compounds of this family.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover demonstrates that electrochemistry in continuous flow is so convenient and reliable that even kids could do it. Electrochemical hydroxylation of sensitive electron&#8208;rich arenes was achieved by the implementation of a flow setup. Our goal is to motivate organic chemists, who tend to be quite conservative, to apply the modern techniques in their everyday research and explore new reaction pathways.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Desulfitative Arylation of Acetylinic Oximes with Sodium Arylsulfinates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic desulfitative arylation of acetylinic oximes with sodium arylsulfinates under oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse 4&#8208;aryl isoxazoles is accomplished. In the presence of 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IPr&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2, both the acetylinic oximes and sodium arylsulfinates are well tolerated.







Abstract
Herein described a highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade desulfitative arylation of acetylinic oximes and sodium arylsulfinates with oxygen as the sole oxidant to access structurally diverse 4&#8208;aryl isoxazoles. This catalytic system exhibits mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity. Notably, other easily available aryl source substrates were perfectly tolerated in this catalytic system, thus providing a promising application in synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry.

Abstract
The combination of organocatalysis with transition metal catalysis is an emerging research area for the scientific community. Various unprecedented transformations that are otherwise inaccessible by individual catalytic systems can be achieved with good efficiency and stereocontrolled manner by this dual&#8208;catalytic strategy. This Review presents a detailed discussion on the recent advances in dual catalytic systems combining organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis, covering the literature of the last five years. A wide variety of combinations of transition metals with organocatalysts including aminocatalysts, such as secondary amines and more recent primary amines, Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, especially phosphoric acids based on the chiral BINOL scaffold and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts, are discussed. Considering the great contribution of this domain to organic synthesis, the present and future potential of this new and exciting research field is highlighted.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of organocatalysis with transition metal catalysis is an emerging research area for the scientific community. Various unprecedented transformations that are otherwise inaccessible by individual catalytic systems can be achieved with good efficiency and stereocontrolled manner by this dual-catalytic strategy. This Review presents a detailed discussion on the recent advances in dual catalytic systems combining organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis, covering the literature of the last five years. A wide variety of combinations of transition metals with organocatalysts including aminocatalysts, such as secondary amines and more recent primary amines, Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, especially phosphoric acids based on the chiral BINOL scaffold and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene catalysts, are discussed. Considering the great contribution of this domain to organic synthesis, the present and future potential of this new and exciting research field is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fungal &#946;&#8208;Mannosyloxymannitol Glycolipids and Their Analogues: Synthesis and Mincle&#8208;Mediated Signaling Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 20, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereomeric pair of mannosyloxymannitol glycolipids and its analogues were synthesized and analyzed for the structure&#8211;Mincle&#8208;mediated signaling activity relationships. The results suggest that the dimannosyloxy fatty acid moiety of the mannosyloxymannitol glycolipid plays a major role in the molecular recognition of Mincle.







Abstract
Mincle, a C&#8208;type lectin receptor (CLR), senses certain lipid conjugates, leading to the activation of the innate immune system. The lipid conjugate ligands include glyco&#8208;, glycero&#8208;, and mannitol lipids. Recently, a fungal &#946;&#8208;mannosyloxymannitol glycolipid demonstrating a novel architecture, &#8220;44&#8208;2,&#8221; was isolated from the fungus Malassezia and displayed potent Mincle&#8208;mediated signaling activity. For this study, we synthesized the diastereomeric pair of mannosyloxymannitol glycolipids and their analogues and analyzed the structure&#8208;activity relationships of Mincle&#8208;mediated signaling. The results suggest that the dimannosyl&#8208;fatty acid moiety in the mannosyloxymannitol glycolipid&#8208;type structure plays a major role in the molecular recognition of Mincle.

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent antagonists able to reach the four carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of DC&#8208;SIGN have been prepared. The extended rigid core of these glycodendrimers allows multivalent presentation of glycomimetic molecules in a spatially defined fashion, providing high affinity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and selectivity over other C&#8208;type lectins featuring distinct CRD arrangements. The constructs successfully inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and DC&#8208;SIGN mediated trans&#8208;infection by Ebola virus.







Abstract
Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. In this work, we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus trans&#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.

Room temperature, Liquid assisted grinding was used for the synthesis 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and atom economic process bearing wide substrate scope and the isolation of products is chromatography free. It shows an efficient application of mechanochemical synthesis and also exemplifies green chemistry.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <title>A Toolbox of Fluorescent Peptide Biosensors to Highlight Protein Kinases in Complex Samples: Focus on Cyclin&#8208;Dependent Kinases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses fluorescent peptide biosensors designed to report on PK activities, highlighting a toolbox of biosensors tailored to report on cyclin&#8208;dependent kinases. These selective optical probes not only enable quantification of differences in kinase activities between healthy and cancer cells but also constitute attractive and powerful chemical tools for diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Development of sensitive and selective strategies for detection of disease biomarkers constitutes a major challenge for diagnostics and companion assays. New strategies are required to advance personalized and point&#8208;of&#8208;care medicine. Protein kinases (PK) are hyperactivated in many human cancers, therefore constituting relevant biomarkers and attractive pharmacological targets.Yet quantification of PK expression levels alone does not convey an accurate readout of their activity, since PKs are subject to numerous interactions and post&#8208;translational regulations. Hence technologies that report on PK function are essential for complete appreciation of their behaviour and dysregulation in physio&#8208;pathological settings. This Review focuses on fluorescent peptide biosensors designed to report on PK activities, and in particular on a toolbox of biosensors tailored to monitor cyclin&#8208;dependent kinases. These selective optical probes offer a straightforward means of quantifying differences in kinase activities between healthy and cancer cells, and can report on alterations in response to therapeutics in&#8197;vitro, in living cells and in&#8197;vivo.

         <dc:description>2&#8208;(2&#8208;(Benzylthio)benzylidene)malonates can undergo the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift triggered cyclization resulting in thiachromanes in 45&#8208;84% yield. Boron trifluoride as a reaction promotor is the key of success. DFT&#8208;calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via a chelate BF2 complex, that was confirmed by NMR&#8208;analysis. Experimental and theoretical comparison of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon analogues, revealed that sulfur derivatives have the highest activation barrier for the hydride transfer due to the unfavourable transition state geometry, which explains the lack of previous reports on 1,5&#8208;hydride shifts in (alkylthio)styrenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C  sp2  &#8211;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for C  sp2  &#8211;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this review, the recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C  sp2  &#8211;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally facile and high yielding one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for the preparation of pyridines appended with pyrazole  via  NH linker. This protocol includes S  N  ipso  /aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions in up to 54% yields starting from 1,2,4&#8208;triazine precursors. All the synthesized compounds have been evaluated for their  in silico  activity against JAK1, SYK, and FAK1 kinases. The most promising compound was tested  in vitro  using A&#8208;172, Hs578T, and HepG2 cancer cell lines and exhibited considerable cytotoxicity with IC  50  values &lt;50 &#956;M in A&#8208;172 and HepG2 cell lines.  Experimental anticancer activity correlates well with the predicted data.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified strategy for the synthesis of natural products containing &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones as the main core is reported. This strategy is based on a photocatalyzed radical ionic sequence for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones. Depending on the necessities of the synthetic targets, the reaction conditions can be adjusted for obtaining a diastereoisomeric mixture or a single diasteroisomer of the lactones. Also, &#948;&#8208;lactones can be prepared by this method. The utility of this procedure was demonstrated by the total synthesis of five natural products.</dc:description>

Abstract
A convenient and versatile synthesis of &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, including &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones and &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones by using Wu&#8211;Colby's protocol involving the release of trifluoroacetate was reported. The ketones&#8217; application as monofluoroalkyl building blocks was explored through coupling and radical reactions. The results indicated that &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones are the most popular reagents to construct diverse valuable single&#8208;fluorinated molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convenient and versatile synthesis of &#945;-halo-&#945;-fluoroketones, including &#945;-iodo-&#945;-fluoroketones, &#945;-bromo-&#945;-fluoroketones and &#945;-chloro-&#945;-fluoroketones by using Wu&#8211;Colby's protocol involving the release of trifluoroacetate was reported. The ketones&#8217; application as monofluoroalkyl building blocks was explored through coupling and radical reactions. The results indicated that &#945;-iodo-&#945;-fluoroketones are the most popular reagents to construct diverse valuable single-fluorinated molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Humins&#8208;Like Solid Support for Palladium Immobilization: Highly Efficient and Recyclable Catalyst for Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present work, a new humins&#8208;like resin was prepared using 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) and maleic anhydride in 2 min at 110 &#176;C. Such a new material was used as a solid support for palladium immobilization. For metal anchoring, encapsulation was the method of choice and palladium was encapsulated by in&#8208;situ polymerization. This resulting Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was characterized by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, FT&#8208;IR, SEM, TGA, DSC, XRD, and XPS. To demonstrate proof of concept, Heck and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to evaluate the activity and reusability of the catalyst. Green solvents such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), CyreneTM and ethylene carbonate proved to be excellent reaction media for Heck coupling, whereas EtOH/H2O was preferred for Suzuki coupling. Yields of up to 99% were obtained in both cases. The recyclability of the Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was also demonstrated, 7 cycles have been achieved without loss of catalytic activity in both Heck and Suzuki reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Cycloaddition of an Isolable Dialkylsilylene with Diaryl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloaddition of silylenes with diaryl ketones is an attractive chemical transformation to 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (o&#8208;isotoluene) derivatives. We found that the dearomative (1+4) cycloadditions of an isolable dialkylsilylene (  1  ) proceed faster with electron&#8208;rich diaryl ketones and preferentially occurs at an electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diaryl ketones. Theoretical calculations indicated a carbonyl silaylide (a silylene&#8208;ketone complex) is a key intermediate, which is mainly stabilized by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions of a lone pair orbital on oxygen atom&#160;of the diaryl ketones and a vacant 3p orbital of&#160;  1  . The carbonyl silaylide undergoes the Si&#8208;C bond formation at the ortho&#8208;position of one aryl ring to form formal (1+4) cycloadduct with a very small activation barrier. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the (1+4) cycloadducts reveals their&#160;o&#8208;isotoluene structures. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of the (1+4) cycloadducts in hexane exhibit a &#960;&#8208;&#960;* (HOMO&#8208;LUMO) transition around 370 nm.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>3&#8208;Alkylidenephthalides represent an important class of natural compounds which are also valuable synthetic precursors for the preparation of phthalides. While recent reviews reported the great interest of the phthalides in the field of medicinal chemistry, few reports are mentioning the recent progress for the synthesis of their unsaturated homologs in the position 3. So, the aim of this report is to present the latest progresses (since 2010 and until 2021) in the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkylidenephtalides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism and Origin of Enantioselectivity in Bifunctional Squaramide&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Thiolation of Azlactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full mechanism of the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;thiolation of azlactones catalyzed by a cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived squaramide was carefully investigated through theoretical calculations. The results revealed that the reaction proceeds in two sequential steps. First, the azlactone &#945;&#8208;deprotonation by the catalyst tertiary amine group (which for the major product is the rate&#8208;limiting step) affords a chiral molecular aggregate containing the azlactone enolate. Next, three proposals were evaluated concerning the enantiodetermining step (carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation). It was possible to exclude the azlactone enol as a key intermediate. The most viable pathway consists of a M&#252;nchnone&#8208;type activation mode, which associated with secondary hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalyst and the thiolating reagent (bifunctional catalysis), is responsible for the asymmetric induction process. Thus, by using two different reaction conditions, the theoretical enantiomeric excesses were computed and compared with literature data, presenting a good correlation with the reported experimental values.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH that enables the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmentally friendly process not only obviates the use of toxic reagent, but also exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions and wide sub&#8208;strate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of chemoenzymatic linear cascades for the synthesis of chiral compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by Nature, synthetic chemists try to mimic the efficient metabolic networks in living organisms to build complex molecules by combining different types of catalysts in the same reaction vessel. These multistep cascade processes provide many advantages to synthetic procedures, resulting in higher productivities with lower waste generation and cost. However, combining different chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts can be challenging as reaction conditions might differ greatly. As a highly multidisciplinary area that benefits from advances in chemical catalysis, molecular biology and reaction engineering, this area of study is rapidly progressing. In this review, we highlight recent trends and advances in the construction of multistep chemoenzymatic one&#8208;pot cascades to access chiral compounds as well as the different strategies to solve current challenges in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Angucycline/Tetrangulol Derivatives Using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling and Ring&#8208;Closing Carbonyl&#8211;Olefin Metathesis Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Key steps in the synthesis of derivatives of the angucycline, tetrangulol include the use of a palladium catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the assembly of 2&#8208;(1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde from 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;(1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolane. The biaryl product was then subjected to a iron&#8208;catalysed ring&#8208;closing carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reaction to afford 1,7,12&#8208;trimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyltetraphene, that was oxidized to the corresponding quinone.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8208;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents. However, the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 40 reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8208;X and Cy&#8208;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>C(sp  2  )&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling is one of the powerful transformations in organic synthesis to construct highly ubiquitous anilines and aniline derivatives. The dominance of Pd&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based catalytic systems is evident in the field for a long time. However, Ni&#8208;catalysed methodologies for achieving this reaction have grown gradually as sustainable alternatives in the last two decades. Recent reports of highly applicable photocatalytic and electrochemical amination strategies sufficiently enhanced the potential of Ni&#8208;catalysed aminations. This review summarizes the advancement of this cross&#8208;coupling reaction as a general and efficient method over the last 5 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatility of the Amino Group in Hydrazone&#8208;based Molecular and Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazones are common building blocks of supramolecular entities because they can undergo conformational, configurational, and/or constitutional changes in response to an external stimulus. This Review explores the important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in these different dynamics in molecular and supramolecular systems published in the last decades. Some synthetic methodologies to obtain them are also described.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;based systems have been, and continue to be, widely studied in the field of supramolecular chemistry due to the chemical versatility of their triatomic C=N&#8208;N structure, whose amino nitrogen commonly bears a methyl group or a hydrogen atom. Herein we review the conformational, configurational, and constitutional dynamics of these systems, focusing on the particularly important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in each of those processes observed in molecular and supramolecular systems published in recent decades. Due to the enormous diversity of supramolecular architectures and molecular entities, the most representative synthetic methodologies to obtain them are described.

         <title>Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin&#8208;like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L&#8208;fucose, D&#8208;galactose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe7 and Arg8), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser3, Pro4, and Val13).







Abstract
Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA&#8208;conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17 were crucial for binding BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose, BSA&#8208;D&#8208;galactose and BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser3, Pro4, and Val13 resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg8 plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose/D&#8208;galactose from BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine.

     alt="Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin-like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L-fucose, D-galactose and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Lys&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Tyr&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, Leu&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, and Thr&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and Arg&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pro&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and Val&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA-conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Tyr&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, Leu&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, and Thr&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; were crucial for binding BSA-L-fucose, BSA-D-galactose and BSA-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pro&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and Val&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA-L-fucose/D-galactose from BSA-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The thermodynamics of binding of the selected alanine analogues was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Low to moderate binding affinities were determined for the tetravalent MUC1 glycopeptide and asialofetuin, respectively, and high for the fucose rich polysaccharide, fucoidan. The thermodynamic profile of interactions with asialofetuin exhibits shift to an entropy-driven mechanism compared to the fucoidan, which displayed an enthalpy-entropy compensation, typically associated with the carbohydrate-lectin recognition process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>This paper reported a catalyst&#8208; and metal&#8208;free method to construct disulfide bond with BrCCl 3 under light irradiation. This clean and mild reaction promoted the oxidative coupling of thiols with wide substrate scope, applicable to benzylic, aryl and aliphatic thiols, especially cysteine derivative. The disulfides were obtained in high yields up to 98%, avoiding the usage of heating, strong oxidant, metal reagent and catalyst. This facile strategy will facilitate the synthesis of disulfide compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Functionalization of Chiral N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines and Their Applications in the Synthesis of Bioactive Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>A Photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama Reaction Catalytic in Chromium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylation of aldehydes is possible by a real photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.







Abstract
Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <dc:description>Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br  2  ). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8208;I); e.g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.</dc:description>

         <title>A Clickable Bioorthogonal Sydnone&#8208;Aglycone for the Facile Preparation of a Core 1 O&#8208;Glycan&#8208;Array</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of sydnone&#8208;modified mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycan structures were synthesized chemoenzymatically, allowing for the facile preparation of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;array, by means of metal&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC), for studying O&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation has been shown to be essential for many biological processes. However, determining the exact relationship between O&#8208;glycan structures and their biological activity remains challenging. Here we report that, unlike azides, sydnones can be incorporated as an aglycon into core 1 O&#8208;glycans early&#8208;on in their synthesis since it is compatible with carbohydrate chemistry and enzymatic glycosylations, allowing us to generate a small library of sydnone&#8208;containing core 1 O&#8208;glycans by chemoenzymatic synthesis. The sydnone&#8208;aglycon was then employed for the facile preparation of an O&#8208;glycan array, via bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction, and in turn was utilized for the high&#8208;throughput screening of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;lectin interactions. This sydnone&#8208;aglycon, particularly adapted for O&#8208;glycomics, is a valuable chemical tool that complements the limited technologies available for investigating O&#8208;glycan structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <dc:description>The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Systems Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes for Photoactivated CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, homogeneous earth&#8208;abundant systems that can photoactivate CO2 reduction by means of visible light are reported. In particular, advances on this topic of the past five years (2017&#8211;2021) are reviewed.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 into advantageous chemicals is a noteworthy pathway to close the carbon cycle and decrease carbon footprint. The use of visible light and ultimately solar radiation is extremely interesting in managing energy issues. Similarly, the employment of cost&#8208;effective materials guides to environmentally friendly applications. This Review addresses the homogeneous systems used for photoactivated the CO2 reduction in the last years, highlighting the earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based components. Besides those systems composed only of noble metal&#8208;free units, hybrid systems, also containing a noble metal&#8208;based complex, are also examined, revealing that research needs to increase the attention on more sustainable alternatives.

         <title>Light as a Tool in Organic Photocatalysis: Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation and Chromoselective Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes recent advancements in photocatalysis related to the applications of light as a tool for controlling the reactions selectivity and reactivity. The concepts and applications of multi&#8208;photon excitation photoredox catalysis and chromoselective catalysis in organic synthesis are discussed.







Abstract
Over the past decades, photoredox catalysis has developed to the big mature field of chemistry. Especially in the field of organic synthesis, more and more sustainable alternatives to conventional synthesis are being developed. Nonetheless, most research activities are focused on the development of new synthetic pathways, utilizing photons as a source of energy for breaking and building of new chemical bonds. We discuss here cases, where selection of the irradiation mode, light intensity (one&#8208;, two&#8208; photons) or wavelength (UV, blue, green) has a crucial role on the outcome of the photocatalytic event. Thus, control over irradiation conditions influence the reaction mechanism and offers an access to highly reactive species that are otherwise hardly available. This allows for the unique chemical events to happen, such as deep reduction reactions. The principles of these concepts and their applications are reviewed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

         <title>Flow Conditions&#8208;Controlled Divergent Oxidative Cyclization of Reticuline&#8208;type Alkaloids to Aporphine and Morphinandienone Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a divergent continuous&#8208;flow approach for the biomimetic oxidative cyclization of reticuline&#8208;type alkaloids to aporphine and morphinandienone natural products using hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. The methodologies developed in this work were based on the detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms in order to develop robust and original experimental conditions toward the selective synthesis of either aporphine or morphinandienone natural products. In this frame, we exploited the ability of HFIP to stabilize radical cation intermediates and to activate hypervalent iodine(III) oxidants for the flow synthesis of aporphine natural products such as glaucine, rogersine and nantenine. On the other hand, we established that PhI(OAc)(OTf), prepared by action of TMSOTf on PhI(OAc)2, was a powerful oxidant for the synthesis of morphinandienone natural products such as sebiferine and amurine. Also described in this contribution, the very first structure&#8208;reactivity relationship to assess the current limits of such oxidative flow processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Alkylcarbazoles and Their Identification in Petroleum and Source Rocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of seven C2&#8208;alkylcarbazoles via a sequence of Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling of arylamines with aryl halides followed by oxidative cyclization of the resulting diarylamines. Methyl groups at the positions 4 and 5 were introduced by taking advantage of the ortho&#8208;directed palladation of meta&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;sub&#173;stituted diarylamines and subsequent conversion of the pivaloyloxy to methyl groups via Stille coupling of intermediate triflates. The obtained ethyl&#8208; and dimethylcarbazoles served as analytical standards for their identification in petroleum samples and source rocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Deoxyfunctionalisation Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their abundance and readily available synthesis, alcohols provide ideal handles for the selective derivatisation of organic molecules. Radical chemistry offers versatile strategies for the conversion of C  sp  3  &#8211;O bonds into a wide range of C  sp  3  &#8211;C, C  sp  3  &#8211;H, or &#160;C  sp  3  &#8211;heteroatom bonds. In these reactions, alcohols are readily derivatised with an activator group which can undergo facile mesolysis to generate a primary, secondary, or tertiary open&#8208;shell species that can engage in further transformations. These strategies are particularly effective at overcoming steric limitations associated with nucleophilic substitution pathways. Despite their potential, the use of radical deoxyfunctionalisation reactions as a general strategy for the synthesis of useful and complex molecules remains underutilised. Herein, we highlight recent advancements in this exciting field using photocatalysis, transition metal catalysis or electrochemistry to initiate the radical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Cannabidiol&#8208;C4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol&#8208;C4 1 (CBD&#8208;C4, cannabidibutol) is a natural product present in the extracts of Cannabis. Its isolation has not been reported to date. The aim of the proposed synthesis is to secure the availability of the pure compound, its spectroscopic characterization, and to confirm its presence in low amounts in the extracts. The enantioselective total synthesis is based on a) the use 3,5&#8208;dimetoxybenzaldehyde as starting material, b) Corey&#8208;Bakshi&#8208;Shibata reduction, c) Claisen&#8208;Ireland rearrangement, d) ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and e) completely not&#8208;trivial demethylation induced by sodium ethanethiolate.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis Using Photocatalysis Involved Dual Catalytic System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis with other kinds of catalysis is a powerful strategy to address the barriers met in reactions driven by single catalyst. Under environmentally benign condition, photoredox catalysis produces radical species via visible light irradiation. These species then work with other catalysts, often resulting in unconventional reactivities, by which the scope of reaction could be expanded. Interest in photocatalysis in the synthetic chemistry community has grown tremendously over the past five years, and one of the most striking emerging features is the development of dual catalytic approaches. This minireview summarizes the progress on this theme, mainly including dual catalytic systems merging photoredox activation with acid/base catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Photoswitching for Rate Enhancement of an Organocatalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we report that applying  in situ  LED&#8208;NMR irradiation with appropriate wavelength resulted in the photoswitching of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazone C=N double bond configuration. This reaction was previously reported to be the first step in a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction, where the minor but stable  Z  &#8208;isomer is the reactive intermediate. By enhancing the rate of the isomerization, we could show that the overall rate of the cyclization could be increased and followed directly by NMR kinetics. Exclusively light with a specific wavelength matching the isomerization process affected the cyclization. The light&#8208; and acid&#8208;mediated isomerization provide complementary pathways that can be exploited in synthetic applications to increase reaction rates of asymmetric transformations, especially in reactions requiring high loadings of elaborate chiral catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <dc:description>Due to their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications. In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Biology of &#945;GalCer: A Chemist's Toolbox for the Stimulation of Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to the chemist's toolbox for the stimulation of invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells. This Review encompasses the synthetic strategies for the preparation of the iNKT cell agonist &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer), its TH1/TH2 skewing analogs, and other synthetic probes for the elucidation of mechanisms of &#945;GalCer trafficking.







Abstract
Often referred to as the &#8220;Swiss Army knife&#8221; of the immune system, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes stimulated by the synthetic glycolipid &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) when in complex with the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells. Through their ability to produce TH1 and TH2 cytokines and co&#8208;stimulate several other lymphocytes, iNKT cells have emerged as central players in directing the immune response in a range of physiological processes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Over the years, synthetic chemistry has advanced the field of iNKT cell stimulation with the development of more efficient approaches to prepare &#945;GalCer, and, additionally, with the chemical synthesis of &#945;GalCer analogs in the search of better TH1/TH2 cytokine skewing compounds for therapeutic applications. Here, we review the strategies for the synthesis of &#945;GalCer and its analogs, including synthetic probes, together with the most important advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds, as a guide to the available tools for interrogating the iNKT cell&#8722;&#945;GalCer&#8722;CD1d complex and inspiration for future research.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8211;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

         <title>Quinazoline&#8208;Assisted ortho&#8208;Halogenation with N&#8208;Halosuccinimides through Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative azide&#8208;olefin cycloaddition (OAOC) reaction of differently substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls with azides provided an efficient method for preparing biologically active 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In this study, the cycloaddition reaction was found to be a simple and powerful method for constructing diverse mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;(1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole) functionalized heterocyclic compounds in moderate to high yields with great regioselectivity. The XRD&#8208;analysis data of one of the bis&#8208;triazole derivatives supported the regioselectivity as well as the conformity of the method in the construction of the triazole nucleus. The preliminary antifungal profile against C. albicans was observed with cinnamaldehyde based triazole derivatives demonstrating promising results.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Perfluoroalkylmethyl&#8208;Substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines Derivatives through 1&#8208;Iodo&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(acetoxy) Synthons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, efficient, diastereoselective two&#8208;step synthetic route to substituted tetrahydroquinolines bearing a perfluoroalkylmethyl group, was achieved via a perfluoroalkylated, iodo&#8208;bis&#8208;acetoxy (masked aldol) intermediate resulting from selective radical bis&#8208;addition of vinyl acetate on RF&#8722;I.







Abstract
Novel 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylmethyl,4&#8208;arylamino substituted tetrahydroquinolines (THQ) were expeditiously synthesized from perfluoroalkyl iodides RF&#8722;I and monosubstituted anilines. First, radical bis&#8208;addition of vinyl acetate on RF&#8722;I afforded gem&#8208;iodoacetoxy derivatives (newly characterized by NMR and MS) being actually masked/activated aldol synthons. Their reaction in 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio with arylamines afforded title THQ under mild conditions in good yields (60&#8211;95&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (65&#8201;:&#8201;35&#8211;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 cis/trans isomer ratio); m&#8208;substituted anilines regiospecifically lead to 7&#8208;substituted THQ. Mechanistic investigation suggested the THQ formation to proceed through Michael then imine addition of two aniline units on an RF&#8208;substituted crotonaldehyde intermediate, then through the cyclization of the resulting bis(arylamino/imino) intermediate through electrophilic aromatic substitution. Various RF (C6, C2, C4) and arylamine substitutions (p&#8208;,o&#8208;,m&#8208; alkyl, alkoxyl, halogen&#8230;) were thus exemplified.

         <title>Z&#8209;selective alkene formation from reductive aldehyde homo&#8208;couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E &#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z &#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate Mes F P(H)P(O)(OEt) 2 , 6 , with an electron&#8208;deficient Mes F = 2,4,6&#8208;(CF 3 ) 3 Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z &#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient Mes F , which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of Mes F , the E &#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P &#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of Z&#8208;isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

         <title>Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation and Etherification Reactions of Benzylic Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistriflimide&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of benzylacetates with both trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes lead to propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The acid assists the release of the reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the media, which is the ultimate catalytic species. The cationic nature of the processes is documented.







Abstract
Addition of catalytic amounts of bistriflimide triggers useful coupling reactions of benzyl acetates with trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes to afford propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The added acid assists the release of reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the reaction media, which were found to act as the ultimate catalytic species responsible for the C&#8722;C and the C&#8722;O forming steps. The cationic nature of these coupling processes is documented.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief Review on the conjugation of fatty acids with some small bioactive molecules is presented, with emphasis on lipophenols, branched fatty acyl esters of hydroxyl fatty acids (FAHFAs), glycerolipids, endocannabinoids, lipopeptides and cysteinyl specialized proresolving mediators (Cys&#8208;SPM).







Abstract
Several families of naturally occurring fatty acid conjugates are presented. Chemical and chemoenzymatic syntheses are exemplified for fatty acid conjugates with (poly)phenols, glycerol, hydroxyfatty acids, aminoacids and small peptides.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Molecular Targets of Neurotoxic Insecticides in Apis mellifera</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cloning of the honeybee genes encoding ion channels targeted by neurotoxic insecticides and their functional reconstitution in heterologous expression system allow the assessment of the different insecticide classes including pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. Elucidation of their mode of action, by combining electrophysiology and molecular docking, might help for the development of insecticides less harmful for beneficial insects.







Abstract
The intensive use of insecticides, combined with other factors such as habitat loss, might explain worldwide decrease of insect populations documented in the past twenty years. However, due to the involvement of pest species in crop destruction and in vector&#8208;borne diseases, insecticides will probably continue to be required still for decades. The most commercially successful insecticides are neurotoxicants acting on ion channels of the central nervous system affecting thereby cellular excitability and synaptic transmission and causing insect paralysis and fatality. In this article, we provide an overview of the insecticides acting on voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels, GABA&#8208;gated chloride channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We summarize the current knowledge on those ion channels from the honeybee Apis mellifera and discuss the possible mode of action of neurotoxic insecticides.

         <title>Conjugation of Carbohydrates with Quinolines: A Powerful Synthetic Tool</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of carbohydrates with quinolines is an useful strategy to improve the bioactivity profile of the quinoline scaffold. This Review discusses the synthetic efforts to access these valuable molecules and the isolation of glycoquinolines from natural sources in the period 2000&#8211;2021. In addition, the bioactivity profiles and potential therapeutic uses of these compounds are presented.







Abstract
A detailed revision on natural and synthetic glycosylated quinolines, spanning the last 20&#8197;years, is presented. Exhaustive descriptions about the state of the art of the synthesis and relevant applications of these glyco&#8208;heterocycles are provided. In addition, an account of the natural products containing this motif and their associated bioactivity data are also outlined. For the sake of consistency, quinolones are also covered as well as hybrid compounds, embodied with linkers between the heterocyclic ring and the carbohydrate fragment.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide-containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azide-containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non-participating C2-azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2-azido-2-deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine-containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non-participating C2-azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Structure of Hemicalide from the Marine Sponge Hemimycale sp</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemicalide, isolated from the marine sponge Hemimycale sp., is a very potent cytotoxic compound from a marine sponge with an original mode of action. Its planar structure has been established by NMR and a proposal for 17 of its 21 stereogenic centers is made on the basis of syntheses of analogues.







Abstract
Hemicalide is a marine natural product isolated from the sponge Hemimycale sp., collected near the Torres Islands of Vanuatu. It is characterized by cytotoxicity in the sub&#8208;nanomolar range, with an original mode of action. This article describes the establishment of the planar structure of hemicalide, based on extensive use of 2D&#8208;NMR experiments. The molecule belongs to the polyketide class with an irregular combination of acetates and propionates and adorned with two unusual hydroxylated six&#8208;membered ring lactones. After publication of the original patent, groups in Paris and Cambridge (UK) launched synthetic programmes with the aim of elucidating the configurations of some of the 21 stereogenic centers. The second part of the article discusses these achievements and presents the best hypothesis, to date, for hemicalide.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8211;activity studies produced a new near infrared cyanine heptamethine molecular probe that is rapidly activated by nitroreductase enzyme to give &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence that can penetrate thick biological tissue.







Abstract
Two new classes of near&#8208;infrared molecular probes were prepared and shown to exhibit &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence when cleaved by the nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of cell hypoxia. The fluorescent probes are heptamethine cyanine dyes with a central 4&#8216;&#8208;carboxylic ester group on the heptamethine chain that is converted by a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism to a 4&#8216;&#8208;caboxylate group that greatly enhances the fluorescence brightness. Each compound was prepared by ring opening of a Zincke salt. The chemical structures have either terminal benzoindolinenes or propargyloxy auxochromes, which provide favorable red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission wavelengths and a hyperchromic effect that enhances the photon output when excited by 808&#8197;nm light. A fluorescent probe with terminal propargyloxy&#8208;indolenines exhibited less self&#8208;aggregation and was rapidly activated by nitroreductase with large &#8220;turn on&#8220; fluorescence; thus, it is the preferred choice for translation towards in&#8197;vivo applications.

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <title>MALDI&#8208;MS/MS of N&#8208;Terminal TMPP&#8208;Acyl Peptides: A Worthwhile Tool to Decipher Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acylation with tris(trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium (TMPP), a chemical reagent specifically targeting peptide N&#8208;termini, was found to provide very valuable sequencing information provided that the derivatized charged peptide was engaged in MALDI MS/MS analyses combining LID and CID activations. In addition to readable N&#8208;terminal sequence ion series, fragmentation of aliphatic residues side&#8208;chain distinguished isomeric leucine and isoleucine. Unexpected cysteine acylation was also evidenced.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal derivatization of proteins with permanently positive charged reagent constitutes a viable mass spectrometry bottom&#8208;up strategy for systematic confident identification of protein N&#8208;termini. Although shotgun nanoLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS approaches are commonly applied in that context by dissociating multiply charged molecular ions upon low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociations (CID), we were keen to investigate an alternative sequencing method reckoning on more comprehensive high energy charge remote fragmentations (CRF) available with a MALDI&#8208;Tof/Tof instrument. Hence, two tunable activation methods, i.&#8201;e. metastable laser&#8208;induced dissociations (LID) and high energy CID, were applied to several synthetic N&#8208;terminal tris(trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium (TMPP) acetyl peptides and their MS/MS behaviors were compared with low energy CID MS/MS data (LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;QqTof equipment). The amino acid composition was found to play a significant role in the peptide backbone dissociation pathways of these fixed singly charged ions. Proline, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, but also surprisingly aliphatic residues were impacting the expected sequence fragmentation pattern.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly, substrate compatibility was explored. 21 new disulfide and thioether macrocycles were synthesized that incorporated a wide breadth of structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.

         <title>New Mechanistic Insights into the Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the results of our quantum mechanical investigation of the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters catalyzed by [RuCl  2  (MeOH)  2  ((  R  )&#8208;MeOBIPHEP)] (  7a  ), which is generated  in situ  from [Ru(OAc)  2  ((  R  )&#8208;MeOBIPHEP)] (  4a  ) and HCl in methanol. Interestingly, HCl not only acts as an activator for  4a  as it has a dramatic effect on the reaction itself: While HCl /  4a  = 2 leads to rather poor results (36% ee and 13% conv. after 4 h at S / C = 50&#8217;000), HCl /  4a  = 20 results in high efficiency (&gt;99.9% conv.) and enantioselectivity (99% ee favoring the opposite enantiomer) under otherwise identical conditions. The origin for this sweeping change in performance has remained a mystery for two decades. Here, we show for the first time that a highly selective HCl pathway becomes operational under acidic conditions, which outcompetes moderately selective pathways dominating under neutral conditions. Furthermore, we explain the effects of common phosphorus substituents on the activity of the catalyst</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene Carbonates from Aromatic Aldehydes**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one&#8208;pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The combination of a N&#8208;phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity. The reaction scope was investigated with a range of aromatic aldehydes and the corresponding vinylene carbonates were obtained with 32&#8211;86&#8201;% isolated yields (14&#8197;examples).

         <title>Quadruple Functionalization of a Tetraphenylethylene Aromatic Scaffold with Ynamides or Tetracyanobutadienes: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraphenylethylene compound was effectively functionalized in three synthetic steps with four ynamide and four TCBD (1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene) groups. The latter displays near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Ynamides are useful and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis, from which 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes (TCBD) can be prepared for application in molecular electronics. However, their insertion onto multi&#8208;functional molecular scaffold remains a synthetic challenge. In this work, we report the two&#8208;steps synthesis in good isolated yield (64&#8201;% overall, 89&#8201;% stepwise) of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bearing four ynamides, and its further one&#8208;step conversion into the tetra&#8208;TCBD derivative through a [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization sequence. The concomitant formation of the four ynamides required a specific optimisation of the reaction conditions. Although a poor fluorescent emitter in solution, the tetra&#8208;TCBD compound displayed near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state, which is an attractive optoelectronic feature when considering future applications in molecular electronic devices.

In this work, we report the two-steps synthesis in good isolated yield (64&#8201;% overall, 89&#8201;% stepwise) of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bearing four ynamides, and its further one-step conversion into the tetra-TCBD derivative through a [2+2] cycloaddition-retroelectrocyclization sequence. The concomitant formation of the four ynamides required a specific optimisation of the reaction conditions. Although a poor fluorescent emitter in solution, the tetra-TCBD compound displayed near-infrared luminescence in the solid state, which is an attractive optoelectronic feature when considering future applications in molecular electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Ionic Liquids from Natural Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;, pyrazolium&#8208;, and bis&#8208;benzimidazolium&#8208;containing ionic liquids were synthesized from easily available, unprotected carbohydrates such as d&#8208;ribose, d&#8208;xylose, d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;fructose and l&#8208;sorbose.







Abstract
Three series of new ionic liquids (ILs), namely imidazolium&#8208;, pyrazolium&#8208;, and bis&#8208;benzimidazolium&#8208;containing ILs, were prepared from low&#8208;cost, unprotected carbohydrates. Information on anion&#8208;cation interactions and solvation shell were obtained via diffusion NMR and heteronuclear Overhauser correlation maps (HOESY), respectively.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis Enables the Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Olefins Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins with carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed, which is based on visible&#8208;light photoredox/boronic acid catalysis. The direct use of CAs as acyl&#8208;radical precursors was made possible with the aid of boronic acid, and CAs were easily converted into the corresponding cyclic ketones without the need for any stoichiometric activating reagents.







Abstract
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins using carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed. With the aid of a boronic acid, CAs can be used as acyl&#8208;radical precursors in catalytic photoredox reactions driven by visible light. The CAs are easily converted into their corresponding cyclic ketones without the need to use any stoichiometric activating reagents. Mechanistic studies implied that the formation of an &#8220;ate&#8221; complex from the CA and boronic acid is crucial for the generation of the acyl radical equivalent from the unreactive carboxy group.

         <title>Origins of Organic Chemistry and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of organic chemistry and organic synthesis started in the middle ages, long before molecular compositions were known. Paradigm shifts caused by Lavoisier, Chevreuil, W&#246;hler, Liebig, Kolbe and Berthelot are highlighted. The graphic shows some early key organic molecules, but although synthesis and analysis had become well established sciences by the 1840s, the chemical structures remained essentially unknown.







Abstract
The words organic and synthesis originate with Aristotle (meaning &#8216;instrumental&#8217; and &#8216;put together&#8217;, respectively) but had different meanings over time. The iatrochemists prepared numerous pharmaceutical remedies in the 1600s but had no concept of organic chemistry. Buffon, Bergman and Gren defined organic bodies as living things in the 1700s, but discrete organic compounds remained unknown. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, organic natural products were isolated by Scheele, and Chevreuil separated carboxylic acids from saponification of fats. Organic chemistry had started. Lavoisier invented and Berzelius improved combustion analysis for organic characterization. Descartes&#8217; dictum that synthesis is required to prove an analysis was enacted by Bergman and others. The concept of organic chemistry changed radically when W&#246;hler and Kolbe prepared organic compounds from the elements. Berthelot's syntheses of non&#8208;natural fats in 1853 started modern synthetic organic chemistry as the chemistry of carbon compounds, regardless of whether occurring in Nature or not.

Abstract
An efficient protocol for the synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones is described. First, propargyl&#8208;containing Ugi adducts were transformed to polysubstituted dihydroisoquinolines by an intramolecular Au&#8208;catalyzed alkyne hydro&#8208;arylation, followed by the alkene isomerization process. Then, these pivotal intermediates were engaged in a xanthate&#8208;based oxidative radical cascade addition/cyclization process with a suitable alkene.

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters and Amides through Hydrogen Borrowing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the iridium catalysed direct alkylation of amino esters and amides using alcohols, which can utilise both the free base and HCl salts of the amine, was developed. This reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen borrowing mechanism.







Abstract
The iridium catalysed N&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and amides using alcohols through hydrogen borrowing has been developed. The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Conjugated Macrocyclic Nanoring with Graphenic Hexabenzocoronene Sidewall as the Segment of [12,12] Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall was facilely synthesized. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by different techniques. Its photophysical properties and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices were further studied.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Tyrosine&#8208;Click Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine&#8208;click reaction was established for the conjugation of oligonucleotides exhibiting a tyrosine moiety and using phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model. The reaction can be applied in solution or on solid support.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;Diacetyl tyrosine and 3&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;propanoic acid were converted into phosphoramidite derivatives and introduced to the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of oligonucleotides. The resulting oligonucleotides exhibiting a 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl alkyl group were conjugated with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model of a Y&#8208;click reaction. The reaction is fast (&lt;1&#8197;h) and efficient (&gt;90&#8201;%). A partial side reaction occurred at the C8 position of deoxyguanosine in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. This side reaction does not take place on the G quadruplex and double&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides and when N2 position of guanine is protected. This Y&#8208;click reaction could be applied to 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione derivatives displaying a fluorescent dye, a carbohydrate or orthogonal functions (alkyne, azide, ketone or maleimide) for the labelling of oligonucleotides.

         <title>Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Cryptands with Rarely Strong Affinities for Binding Neutral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8242;iterative approach&#8242; of delicately tunning the non&#8208;covalent interactions could be a powerful route to construct molecular hosts that exhibit high selectivity and affinity for guest molecules. Through tailoring spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (especially H&#8208;bonding), cryptands with rarely strong affinities for binding neutral guest molecules were achieved.







Abstract
Herein, we present the syntheses of two new crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based cryptands and their complexation behaviors with neutral organic molecules. The interactions between 4/5 and G1/G2 were fast exchange systems forming pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio. The association constant (Ka) of &#8220;long&#8208;armed&#8221; cryptand 5 with G2 was even up to 2.5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, which is 10 to 103&#8197;times higher than the previously reported host&#8208;neutral guest system to the best of our knowledge. Such a large Ka is even comparable to that of reported cryptands with secondary ammonium salts and paraquat derivatives. Thorough studies demonstrated that excellent spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) are essential for such a large Ka.

         <title>Annelated Pyridine Bases for the Selective Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acylation of primary over secondary hydroxyl groups in 1,2&#8208;ethanediols depends strongly on size effects and noncovalent interactions between the alcohol side chains and the catalysts surface.







Abstract
A set of 24 annelated derivatives of 4&#8208;diaminopyridine (DMAP) has been synthesized and tested with respect to its catalytic potential in the regioselective acylation of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates. The Lewis basicities of the catalysts as quantified through quantum chemical calculations vary due to inductive substituent effects and intramolecular stacking interactions between side chain &#960;&#8208;systems and the pyridinium core ring system. The primary over secondary hydroxyl group selectivities in catalytic acylations of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates depend on the size and the steric demand of the Lewis base and the anhydride reagent.

         <title>Heterotriptycene Containing an Unsubstituted Bispyrrole: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and 2D Nested Hexagonal Arrays Constructed by NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Intermolecular Interactions</title>

This study describes the synthesis of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole from a novel Diels&#8208;Alder reaction active benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The resulting molecule formed a 2D&#8208;hexagonal array in crystalline state.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and optical properties of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole, 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,8&#8208;benzobenzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]dipyrrole, which was synthesized via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a novel benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The compound formed a 2D nested hexagonal array with NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystalline state; whereas, in the solution state, it exhibited through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced emission in the solution state.
