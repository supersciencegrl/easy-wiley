         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified by a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208; or UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Synthesis of Hydroxamic Acids from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications is increasingly attracting high interest. We present herein a new photochemical protocol for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids, which constitute an important class of medicinal agents, mainly due to their anticancer properties. The method is mediated by UVA&#8208;light or sunlight and its key&#8208;point is the generation of a charge transfer complex by the interaction of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine with a halomethane. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled with O&#8208;protected hydroxylamines, upon irradiation with either LED 370 nm or solar light. A detailed study of the mechanism was carried out by the employment of direct infusion&#8722;high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8722;HRMS), providing experimental evidence for the formation of various activated species, which may lead to the desired product. The light&#8208;mediated protocol was applied in the synthesis of the drugs vorinostat and bufexamac.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium Acetate Catalyzed Formation of 1,5&#8208;Benzodiazepines through [4+2+1] Cycloaddition Involving 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of the renewable platform molecule 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) in multi&#8208;component reaction with a diamine and an alkynone to generate seven&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines is described. Due to the sensitivity of 5&#8208;HMF to strong acidic and basic conditions, the investigation required an in&#8208;depth revisit of reaction parameters as compared to benchmark aldehydes. Among catalysts/solvents couples, ammonium acetate in ethanol proved to be a clean and efficient system. These optimized conditions were subsequently used to investigate the scope of the reaction providing a library of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in moderate to good yield from a wide range of diversely substituted diamines and alkynones or alkyl alkynoates</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Bifunctional Pd(0)&#8208;CALB@SiO2 Hybrid Catalyst for the Synthesis and Arylation of Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine in One Pot</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalyst developed by encapsulating Candida antarctica lipase B and Pd(0) within silica to catalyze the sequence of Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling in one pot to produce clinically significant imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the construction of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrid catalyst [Pd(0)&#8208;CALB@SiO2] via encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B and Pd(0) within silica. Next, the applicability of the newly constructed biohybrid was demonstrated by catalyzing the sequence of Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling in a single&#8208;pot to produce clinically significant imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives. Interestingly, both entities, i.e., CALB enzyme and Pd(0)&#8208;metal of hybrid catalyst, exhibited good catalytic activity during this approach. Further, the generality of this protocol was explored by using differently substituted boronic acid, which gave related products in 49&#8211;87&#8201;% isolated yield. Next, the synthetic utility was proved by set&#8208;up a gram scale reaction which provided the complementary product in 81&#8201;% yield. Also, the developed biohybrid was found to be reusable up to five catalytic cycles.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Triarylamines and Poly(triarylamine)s through a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular protocol for the triarylamine synthesis has been developed using diarylamines and electron&#8208;rich arenes, such as phenols, as the building blocks. The KI/KIO4 system proves to be highly efficient for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of phenothiazines/ phenoxazines with phenols/anilines. A wide range of functional groups attached to both coupling partners were well tolerated. Through the manipulation of reaction temperatures, the sequential assembly of bis&#8208;triarylamines could be achieved to provide the unsymmetrically bis&#8208;aminated phenols efficiently. Furthermore, the multiple aminated polyphenols were rapidly constructed in good to high yields by a single operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism and Origin of CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrocarboxylation of Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes is an enantio&#8208; and regioselective approach for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing compounds. DFT calculations were used to explore the mechanisms and origins of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity of CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes.







Abstract
The CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes is an enantio&#8208; and regioselective approach for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing compounds. With density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity and regioselectivity. The hydrocarboxylation proceeds through the migratory insertion of allenes on CuH complex, the enantioselective addition of fluoroformate, and the &#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination gives the branched carboxylation products. The electron&#8208;donating alkyl and phenyl groups in the allene polarize the C=C bond and thus lead to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective migratory insertion. In addition, the enantioselective addition of fluoroformate by either (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;addition determines the enantioselectivity. The (S)&#8208;addition is more favorable due to the bulky &#8722;tBu group of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS ligand, which prefers keeping the C=C bond of allene away from the reaction center in six&#8208;membered transition state and thus results in (S)&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;containing products.

         <title>Cationic Symmetrically and Unsymmetrically Substituted Diboranes and Bis(diboranes) with Direct Boron&#8208;Boron Bond: Synthesis by Substitution, Stability and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for the directed synthesis of unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes are established; the kinetics of substitution of the triflato group in monocationic triflato&#8208;diboranes is controlled by the properties of the neutral Lewis base bound to the second boron atom.







Abstract
Starting with diboranes with two electron&#8208;rich bridging bicyclic guanidinate substituents, we report in this work the rational synthesis of new dicationic symmetrically&#8208; and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes in SN1&#8208;type substitution reactions in which triflato or bromo substituents are replaced by neutral Lewis bases. The scope of such substitution reactions and their rate are analyzed with different pyridine derivatives of variable Lewis basicity. The first substitution step, leading to a monocationic diborane with one anionic substituent (triflate or bromide) and one neutral Lewis base, proceeds much faster than the second substitution step leading to a dicationic diborane with two neutral Lewis bases. The different time scales for the substitution steps could be used to conveniently synthesize in one&#8208;pot reactions several dicationic, unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diboranes with two different neutral Lewis bases.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxazolidinones through One&#8208;Pot Coupling of Benzylamines, Epoxides and CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones are prepared through a one&#8208;pot coupling of amines, epoxides and CO2 promoted by 1,1,3,3,&#8208;tetramethylguanidine under visible light irradiation at atmospheric pressure. Computational calculations suggest the formation of [TMG&#8208;CO2] adduct as an intermediate.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones from a three component coupling reaction of amines, epoxides, and CO2. The reaction proceeds in the presence of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine under visible light irradiation at atmospheric pressure. The optimized structures of all species involved in the reaction mechanism along with transition states have been described based on the DFT calculations. The developed methodology represents a promising approach of employing CO2 as a naturally abundant and non&#8208;toxic carbon resource to produce profitable chemicals.

         <title>HFO&#8208;1234yf as a CF3 Building Block: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Quinoline and Chromene Derivatives from Trifluoromethyl&#8208;ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethyl ynones derived from the refrigerant HFO&#8208;1234yf undergo a tandem Michael addition&#8208;cyclisation reaction with 2&#8208;amino or 2&#8208;hydroxyaryl carbonyls to form 2&#8208;trifluoromethylquinolines and 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxychromenes, respectively, in a single step. Thus generating pharmaceutically relevant structures from an inexpensive feed&#8208;stock.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl ynones derived from the refrigerant gas HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene) react with nucleophiles via a Michael&#8208;type addition process and the allenolate intermediate formed reacts intramolecularly with a carbonyl group to form heterocyclic derivatives. Thus, reaction of 2&#8208;amino and 2&#8208;hydroxyl benzaldehyde or ketone substrates with trifluoromethyl ynone derivatives gives trifluoromethyl quinoline and chromene products by a one&#8208;pot tandem ring closing sequence, forming pharmaceutically relevant structures from an inexpensive starting material without the need for transition metals or column chromatography. The 2&#8208;trifluoromethylquinoline products also show unusual fluxional behaviour, which was explored through 2&#8208;D NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Seiricuprolide and Pestalotioprolide B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total syntheses of seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B, rare 14&#8208;membered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated macrolides embedding a chiral epoxide motif, have been accomplished via a longest linear sequence of 17 steps and 1.9% and 1.6% overall yields, respectively. Our synthesis featured the key Shiina macrolactonization to construct the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic skeleton, Wittig olefination to generate the (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester and selective reduction of advanced chiral propargylic alcohol intermediate to enable the exclusive formation of Z&#8208; or E&#8208;olefin at C8&#8211;C9. Our work also highlighted a highly stereoselective substrate&#8208;controlled m&#8208;CPBA epoxidation to install the C5&#8211;C6 &#946;&#8208;epoxide in &#160;the early stage, which reaffirmed the remarkable robustness of the &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety of both natural products. Synthetic seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against the HCT116 colon cancer cell line as well as their inhibitory effect on CFTR chloride channel activity in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells. These two synthetic macrolides were found to possess no reactivity of both biological activities tested. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship suggested that the C5&#8211;C6 &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety suppressed both biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Compounds for the Synthesis of Amines: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive amination is a valuable method for amine synthesis that has been the topic of a century's worth of in&#8208;depth study in both academia and industry. Amines and their derivatives serve as incredibly adaptable building blocks for a broad array of organic substrates and are significant precursors for a myriad of advanced chemicals, physiologically active compounds, agrochemicals, biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. The creation of innovative catalytic processes for the long&#8208;term and selective synthesis of amines from readily accessible and environmentally benign reagents remains a top priority in chemical research. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been designed with success to enable these reactions to explore new amines. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency. This review comprehensively overviews the Ru&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination processes and includes the literature from 2009 to 2022.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Mediated Sulfur Extrusion of Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes can be used to substitute the highly carcinogenic aminophosphines to extrude sulfur from disulfides from thioethers (here R=aryl). Furthermore, pharmaceutically more interesting compounds such as cystine can be transformed to lanthionine.







Abstract
The sulfur extrusion from organic disulfides is a highly useful reaction recognised for the first time over 40&#8197;years ago. Unfortunately, it is mainly performed by aminophosphines, such as hexamethylphosphorus triamine, which is known to be very carcinogenic. This limits the application of the extrusion reaction especially for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products. We have developed a new method, using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), generated from the corresponding stable imidazolium salts in combination with a base to transform a broad scope of benzylic disulfides to thioethers. In addition disulfide containing esters as well as cystine undergo this reaction.

         <title>Rapid Access to Substituted Indenones through Grignard Reaction and Its Application in the Synthesis of Fluorenones Using Ring Closing Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenones are synthesized using a practical and scalable method. The addition of Grignard reagents to indene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones provides 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indenones through dehydrative aromatization. Significantly, a naturally occurring neo&#8208;lignan has been synthesised in one pot. Moreover, diallyl indenones have been utilized as ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) precursors for synthesising fluorenones through an RCM&#8208;aromatization sequence.







Abstract
An efficient, one&#8208;step method has been used to access a variety of substituted indenones in a regiospecific manner by Grignard addition to indene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione. This method provides straightforward access to natural products such as neo&#8208;lignans and isoampelopsin D analogues. Moreover, diallyl indenones have been synthesized and employed as ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) precursors for the facile synthesis of substituted fluorenone derivatives through an RCM&#8208;aromatization sequence.

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

A practical and green NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones is accomplished. In the presence of 0.5&#8197;mol% of IPr&#8722;Pd&#8722;Py&#8722;Cl2 in [Amim]Cl, both the alkynoic acids and unactivated alkenes were well tolerated, thus giving the desired products in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquids is described. This protocol enables facile access for the preparation of diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity. Moreover, the ionic liquid not only acts as the green solvent, but also as the eco&#8208;friendly chlorine source, thus avoiding the use of excess metal halides such as cupric chloride. Some preliminary mechanistic studies were performed, which further revealed possible pathways for this cascade annulation.

         <title>tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 System Induced C&#8208;2 Functionalization of 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amides with Primary Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type C2&#8722;H functionalization approach including acylation and alkylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. The chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation from alcohols, and the mechanism for the acylation reaction was investigated in detail.







Abstract
A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type acylation approach of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. Simultaneously, the C2&#8722;H alkylation can be realized by accident for special benzyl alcohols bearing strong electron&#8208;donating groups. Most N&#8208;heterocycles were also compatible to afford corresponding acylated products. Furthermore, the mechanism investigation reveals that chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation through abstracting the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H from the alcohols, then underwent nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals addition, deprotonation, and oxidation to provide the target acylation products.

         <title>Zinc Promoted Urea Synthesis Using Carbonyldiimidazole as Carbonyl Source and Its Application for the Synthesis of Cariprazine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure is employed to synthesize both symmetrical and unsymmetrical urea by using a mild carbonyl source CDI, and Zn metal. This established approach is appropriate for all types of amines. We synthesized the FDA&#8208;approved Cariprazine drug molecule using this method.







Abstract
A convenient method has been developed for symmetrical and un&#8208;symmetrical urea synthesis by using Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and recyclable activated zinc metal. This reaction is suitable for all types of amines and gives the desired urea products with good to excellent yield. The developed synthetic approach was employed for the synthesis of the Cariprazine drug.

         <title>Synthesis of [60]Fullerene Hybrids Endowed with Steroids and Monosaccharides: Theoretical Underpinning as Promising anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New [60]fullerene hybrids endowed with steroid and monosaccharide moieties are obtained through a cyclopropanation reaction. The structure of monoadducts were determined by spectroscopic and analytical study. Theoretical calculations predicted the most stable conformations and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. The molecular docking studies suggested the possible application of these compounds as anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
Cyclopropanation reactions between C60 and different malonates decorated with monosaccharides and steroids using the Bingel&#8208;Hirsch methodology have allowed the obtention of a new family of hybrid compounds in good yields. A complete set of instrumental techniques has allowed us to fully characterize the hybrid derivatives and to determine the chemical structure of monocycloadducts. Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel&#8208;type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT&#8208;D3(BJ)/PBE 6&#8208;311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent&#8208;accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.

         <title>Simple Access to 2&#8208;Arylbenzo[b]tellurophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective method for the preparation of benzo[b]tellurophenes has been developed: overnight heating of o&#8208;haloarylalkynes with Te&#8208;NaOH&#8208;DMSO triad without the need for dry and inert atmosphere provides the corresponding benzo[b]tellurophenes.







Abstract
Arguably, the simplest way for the preparation of benzo[b]tellurophenes has been elaborated. Cyclization of o&#8208;haloarylalkynes in the presence of Te&#8208;NaOH&#8208;DMSO triad occurs by simple mixing of starting materials and heating overnight without the need for dry and inert atmosphere and provides the corresponding benzo[b]tellurophenes in up to 90&#8201;% GC&#8208;yield. Catalytic telluration of aryl iodide substrates extends the applicability of the developed cyclization cascade to substrates that are not suitable for the direct SNAr/5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization approach. Successful SEAr in the third position of benzo[b]tellurophene provides a synthetic intermediate for the preparation of Te analogues of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene.

Nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes when heated with pyrazoles in DMSO give oxoamination products through tandem Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with pyrazoles in DMSO was investigated. Unexpectedly, the cyclopropanes underwent Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation with DMSO to form aroylmethylidene malonates as intermediates in the reactions. The intermediates further underwent aza&#8208;Michael addition with pyrazoles in tandem manner to give the corresponding aza&#8208;Michael adducts. The highlights of the methodology include the occurrence of ring&#8208;opening/oxidation under neutral conditions with DMSO and formation of aza&#8208;Michael adducts with pyrazoles under catalyst&#8208;free conditions.

Synthesis of 4&#8208;alkenylated pyrazolinones derivatives by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes with pyrazolinones. The methodology has the advantages of metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, high atom economy, and mild condition.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diarylpropenes firstly serve as efficient alkenylated reagents for the functionalization of pyrazolinones. In the presence of 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), it undergoes oxidative coupling and final dehydrogenation to give the highly substituted E,E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;dienpyrazolinones in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Electrochemical Bromination of Substituted Thiophenes in Batch and Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical bromination of substituted thiophenes and benzothiophenes from ammonium bromide was developed to produce 2&#8208;bromo thiophenes and 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes with moderate to excellent yields under both batch and continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
An electrochemical bromination of thiophenes from ammonium bromide is developed both in batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Substituted thiophenes possessing 2&#8208;hydrogens selectively afford a series of 2&#8208;bromothiophenes while 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes generate 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes. Based on the cyclic voltammetric studies and literature, a bromine cation involved mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Flavin&#8208;Indole Conjugates with Rigid Diamino Linkers as Cryptochrome Model Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise reductive aminations of aldehydes derived from indole and flavin with rigid 1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and 2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;trans&#8208;decalin linkers furnished two model compounds for avian cryptochromes. Radical pair formation by light&#8208;induced electron&#8208;transfer in such dyads was proposed to show a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent quantum effect.







Abstract
The synthesis of flavin&#8208;indole conjugates with a trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and a 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene linker is reported. Both compounds should serve as artificial model compounds for natural cryptochrome. It is assumed that cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins located in the retina show a light&#8208;dependent quantum effect which enables migratory birds to perceive the Earth's magnetic field and is thus used for navigation. Both model compounds were prepared by stepwise reductive aminations of indole carbaldehyde and a flavin&#8208;substituted acetaldehyde with the appropriate diamine linkers. The hitherto unknown 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene was prepared in four steps from 2,6&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene as the achiral (meso) ax,ax,trans&#8208;diastereoisomer. The configuration of this key intermediate as well as synthetic precursors has been established by a series of X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening addition reaction of activated vinyl cyclopropanes with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones provides N&#8208;tosylhydrazone butenylmalonate compounds in good yields. Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening addition reaction of activated vinyl cyclopropanes with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones in the presence of palladium(0) and triphenylphosphine affords N&#8208;tosylhydrazone butenylmalonate compounds. Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products. The transformation relationship of the terminal and internal N&#8208;allylated products in the reaction was also observed. A reasonable mechanism is proposed based on preliminary experimental results.

         <title>Front Cover: Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 7/2023)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the formation of a new fused heterocycle derived from furanose saccharide. This reaction is possible thanks to a deoxyfunctionalisation event through an intramolecular thermal Minisci reaction. The cover image was inspired by the creatures named Susuwatari, created by Studio Ghibli for some of their films. These soot spirits emerge from fire, acting as stabilizers of the radical species, as well as mediators of the newly formed bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. G&#243;mez&#8208;Su&#225;rez et&#8197;al.

         <title>Progress in (Thio)urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Based Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysts with Multiple H&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays chiral (thio)urea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based Br&#248;nsted base catalysts are widely applied to enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. In recent years, variations of these catalysts that incorporate and additional H&#8208;bond donor unit (green remark) have been shown to perform often superior in terms of activity and stereoselectivity. This Review covers aspects on these catalysts design and their applications.







Abstract
Thiourea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based bifunctional base catalysts represent nowadays a powerful tool in the field of asymmetric catalysis and have demonstrated very efficient for promoting a wide variety of transformations enantioselectively. New versions that incorporate one or various additional H&#8208;bond donor site(s) in the catalyst structure have been developed recently which led to more active (reduced catalyst loadings) and selective catalysts. This review highlights the pioneering ideas and the most recent contributions to the area with the material organized according to the nature of the additional H&#8208;bond donor functionality. The advantages, current limitations and perspectives of these new multifunctional catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 7, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you need to know about Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and its successful implementation in the lab. Based on recent literature the most frequently used olefination methodologies have been reviewed focusing on the key parameters beneficially influencing the reaction outcome. Typically used Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagent synthesis protocols as well as the development of modified reagents are also highlighted.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination has become one of the most powerful and reliable C=C double&#8208;bond construction methods typically furnishing E&#8208;configured alkenes. This review summarizes the scientific literature of the past decade focusing on the key aspects for successful execution of the olefination step. The main stereoselectivity and yield&#8208;determining aspects have been outlined in separate chapters providing all the necessary information for the synthesis of Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagents as well as the most commonly used reaction optimization techniques.

While common methods giving access to N&#8208;substituted&#8208;pyrrolo&#8208;[3,4&#8208;b]&#8208;quinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones consist of multistep synthesis involving quinoline&#8208;based substrates, a broadly applicable one&#8208;step palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative imidization&#8208;cyclization process has been developed starting from 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;iodoquinoline, that opens new perspectives for the preparation of such acridinimides with a range of relevant applications.







Abstract
Novel N&#8208;substituted pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones have been prepared via a highly chemoselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative imidazation&#8208;cyclization reaction in a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach. This methodology, which has been applied for the first time to access such original scaffolds through two different protocols involving 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;iodoquinoline, as a typical partner, primary amines, and atmospheric or high carbon monoxide pressure (20&#8197;bar), has shown an excellent tolerance for many functional groups. The use of bidentate ligands such as XantPhos and dppp, either under atmospheric or high&#8208;pressure conditions, provides a wide range of carbonylated compounds in good to excellent yields (up to 82&#8201;%). Furthermore, some new quinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxamides have been isolated as side products in very low yields and have been fully characterized. The solid state structures of three of the synthesized acridinimides have been unequivocally established by single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocyanation of Homostilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the danger of &#8220;chain walking&#8221;, the asymmetric nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes, which are readily accessible by microwave&#8208;assisted Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of allylic alcohols with arylboronic acids, proceeds with useful levels of regio&#8208;retention and enantioselectivities of up to 88.12 e.r. This opens a particular short access to novel colchicinoids.







Abstract
We investigated the previously unknown enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes (homostilbenes). For this purpose, a series of (E)&#8208;homostilbenes were prepared by (microwave&#8208;assisted) Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of allylic alcohols with aryl&#8208;boronic acids. Employing our established catalyst system formed from Ni(cod)2 and a TADDOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphine&#8208;phosphite ligand and using TMSCN as an in situ source of HCN, the hydrocyanation of various homostilbenes was studied. The synthetic usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated in a short synthesis of the new (allo&#8208;) colchicine analogue 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;11&#8208;methoxy&#8208;colchinol involving an PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative cyclization of the corresponding hydrocyanation product to set up the 7&#8208;membered ring. The absolute configuration of 2,4&#8208;diphenylbutyronitrile was assigned by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra.

Employing our established catalyst system formed from Ni(cod)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a TADDOL-derived chiral phosphine-phosphite ligand and using TMSCN as an in situ source of HCN, the hydrocyanation of various homostilbenes was studied. The synthetic usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated in a short synthesis of the new (allo-) colchicine analogue 7-cyano-11-methoxy-colchinol involving an PIDA-mediated oxidative cyclization of the corresponding hydrocyanation product to set up the 7-membered ring. The absolute configuration of 2,4-diphenylbutyronitrile was assigned by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Hydrosilylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported employing ruthenium complex [RuCl(PPh3)2(&#951;5&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylindenylidene))] as catalyst. The developed protocol provides the efficient dearomatization of a broad range of substituted quinolines and related N&#8208;heteroarenes at low catalyst loading under mild conditions. A plausible mechanism is probed through stoichiometric reactions and DFT caculations.







Abstract
An efficient method for the regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported utilizing silanes as the hydride donor. The ruthenium complex [RuCl(PPh3)2(&#951;5&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylindenylidene))], a versatile catalyst is, for the first time, employed in this catalytic reaction. The catalyst displays high catalytic efficiency at low loading and operates under mild conditions. This catalytic approach showcases high compatibility and regioselectivity with quinolines bearing different substituents and related N&#8208; heterocyclic compounds. The mechanism of this transformation was probed by performing stoichiometric reactions and examined using DFT calculations.

         <title>Nucleophilicities of Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Diazo Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of the reactions of cyclic &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds with electrophilic benzhydrylium ions were evaluated to determine the Mayr reactivity descriptors N (and sN) of the nucleophiles. Interestingly, the thus obtained N scale also reflects relative reactivities of the diazo compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate.







Abstract
The one&#8208;bond nucleophilic reactivities of seven cyclic &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds in dichloromethane were determined by analyzing the kinetics of their reactions with benzhydrylium ions (one&#8208;bond reference electrophiles) at 20&#8201;&#176;C according to the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation. Though not calibrated for pericyclic reactions, the identified nucleophilicities also reflect relative reactivities of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. These (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions primarily gave spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazoles, which underwent thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic (van Alphen&#8208;H&#252;ttel) rearrangements to furnish 1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;fused tricyclic products.

         <title>Still Elusive &#8211; Pd(II)&#8208;Mediated Base Pairing by an Acetophenone Oxime Palladacycle within 15N&#8208;Labelled Double&#8208;Helical Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligodeoxynucleotides incorporating either an &#945; or a &#946; anomer of an 15N&#8208;labelled palladacyclic acetophenone oxime C&#8208;nucleoside were synthesized and hybridized with various natural counterparts. UV, CD and 15N NMR data were consistent with a stable Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pair in the middle of the duplex but failed to prove it conclusively.







Abstract
Both &#945; and &#946; anomers of an acetophenone C&#8208;nucleoside were synthesized and incorporated in the middle of short oligodeoxynucleotides. The ketone oligonucleotides were converted to 15N&#8208;labelled oxime oligonucleotides by treatment with 15N&#8208;hydroxylamine and, finally, cyclopalladated by treatment with lithium tetrachloropalladate. Comparison of the UV melting profiles of duplexes bearing the &#946; anomer of either the palladacyclic or the metal&#8208;free oxime C&#8208;nucleoside suggested formation of a stable Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pair, especially with adenine or thymine as the base pairing partner. Melting profiles of the corresponding duplexes bearing the &#945; anomer were much more convoluted, precluding meaningful comparison. 15N NMR spectra were obtained for the &#946; anomeric oxime oligonucleotide as well as its palladacyclic derivative but the signals unfortunately diminished below detection limit when the latter was hybridized with a complementary strand placing a 15N3&#8208;labelled thymine opposite to the palladacyclic residue.

Interstitial nitrogen&#8208;doped TiO2 nanotubes are utilized as a task&#8208;specific heterogeneous green catalyst for the synthesis of Knoevenagel adducts and &#946;&#8208;enaminones. The synthesized D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type Knoevenagel adducts and &#946;&#8208;enaminones emitted various colors, which can be tuned from cold white light to orange light in the solid state.







Abstract
For the first time, interstitial nitrogen&#8208;doped TiO2 nanotubes (INDTNTs) have been utilized as heterogeneous green catalysts for the synthesis of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type Knoevenagel adducts (3) and &#946;&#8208;enaminones (6). Notable advantages of the present method include its wide substrate scope, low catalyst loading, avoiding the use of hazardous bases and solvents, products do not require chromatographic purification, high yields, catalyst reusability, etc. The optimized catalyst, INDTNTs&#8208;4 has been characterized by XRD, HRTEM, and XPS techniques. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type 3 and 6 have been evaluated. The study revealed that the colour tunability (cold white light to orange light) and the HOMO/LUMO levels depend mainly on the presence of various electron donating and withdrawing groups on the aromatic/heteroaromatic rings of 3 and 6. The results indicate that the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type 3 and 6 could be promising materials for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Flexibility versus Rigidity: How Conformational Constraint, Steric Hindrance and Solvent Impact Binding between &#960;&#8208;Electron Poor Tweezer&#8208;Type Hosts and &#960;&#8208;Electron Rich Guests</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we studied how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two &#960;&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed supramolecular complexes with &#960;&#8208;electron rich residue pyrene, confirmed by UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants.







Abstract
Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymeric materials and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we studied how varying specific structural components of tweezer-receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two &#960;-electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed supramolecular complexes with &#960;-electron rich residue pyrene, confirmed by UV/Vis and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic studies. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweezer-type receptors that form &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymeric materials and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer-receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two &#960;-electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid 3,3&#8217;&#8217;-diamino-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 supramolecular complexes with &#960;-electron rich residues (1,5-dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 71&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values is non-trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot [3+3] Heteroannulative Coupling of Thioamides with Epichlorohydrin: Access to Diverse 1,3&#8208;Thiazinanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient one&#8208;pot transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective protocol has been devised for the direct synthesis of 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazinanes containing diverse functional groups of different electronic and steric nature through intermolecular [3+3] heteroannulative coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with epichlorohydrin in the presence of K2CO3 at room temperature in open air for the first time.







Abstract
An operationally simple and efficient cascade approach to access a series of 1,3&#8208;thiazinanes has been developed through intermolecular [3+3] heteroannulative coupling employing &#946;&#8208;ketothioamide as a C1&#8197;N1S1 unit and epichlorohydrin as a C3 unit at room temperature for the first time. The reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of thiocarbonyl sulfur to less hindered primary carbon of oxirane followed by sequential intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization and dehydrochlorination enabling the coupling by cleavage of C&#8722;O bond and formation of two new C&#8208;S and C&#8208;N bonds in one stretch. This protocol not only avoids potential toxicity and tedious work up procedures, but also features open atmosphere, good to high yields, gram&#8208;scalability, and easy performance from inexpensive, readily available starting materials under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. A probable mechanism for the formation of 1,3&#8208;thiazinanes has been suggested.

         <title>Synthetic Studies Concerned with the Proposed Structure of Ribisin F, a Compound with Nerve Growth Factor Potentiating Activity Isolated from the Medicinal Fungus Phellinus ribis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been achieved from abundant quinic acid. However, the NMR spectral data acquired on the synthetic material do not match those reported for the ribisin F (which are of rather modest quality). In an effort to establish the true structure of ribisin F, an epimer of the assigned structure was also prepared from quinic acid. A comparison of the spectral data obtained on this epimer with those reported for the natural product proved a better match and based on optical rotation data the possible true structure of this distinctive, dihydroxylated and benzofuran&#8208;containing compound is tentatively proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Tuning of Metal&#8208;Free Artificial Photoenzymes through Binding Site Specific Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and development of artificial metal&#8208;free photoenzymes aims to combine the selectivity of enzymatic reactions with the benefits of modern synthetic photocatalysts. Removing the need for rare earth metals and allowing for milder reaction conditions, leading to a more sustainable catalytic system. Here, we present the design of a novel artificial photoenzyme by integrating an organophotocatalytic moiety based on a donor&#8208;acceptor design into a steroid carrier protein (SCP&#8208;2L). SCP&#8208;2L possesses a hydrophobic tunnel facilitating substrate binding in aqueous media. The photocatalyst was site&#8208;selectively bound to three SCP&#8208;2L variants, possessing a non&#8208;native cysteine residue strategically placed around the hydrophobic tunnel of the protein. The three modified photoenzymes were shown to be selective for the oxidation of organic sulfides giving up to 192 turnovers.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in synthetic chemistry, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. The preparation of them often requires either reactive organometallic reagents or transition metals. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free borylation methodologies using radical chemistry for C&#8211;B bond formation have attracted much attention and developed rapidly, which circumvents the use of preformed organometallic reagents. Various successful approaches from different radical precursors (such as, carboxylic acids, amines and alcohols, which are abundant in nature) through either thermochemical, photochemical or electrochemical pathways have been developed. Therefore, in this review, we hope to provide an overview of recent advances in the discovery, development, and mechanistic study of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical borylation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Dance on 2&#8208;Iodobenzofuran and 2&#8208;Iodobenzothiophene and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When 2&#8208;iodobenzofuran was treated sequentially with lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8210;50 &#176;C and an aldehyde, the 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;iodobenzofuran resulting from the halogen dance was the only isolated product. However, from 2&#8208;iodobenzothiophene, these conditions led to mixtures in which the 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;iodobenzothiophene was always accompanied by the 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophene. The use of 2&#8208;bromobenzothiophene as a catalyst made it possible to significantly reduce this competitive dehalogenation. To confirm the halogen dance reaction, the products were unambiguously synthesized by using direct halogenations and deprotolithiation&#8208;trapping sequences as key steps. Our efforts to access 2,7&#8208;disubstituted and 7&#8208;substituted derivatives of benzofuran and benzothiophene have also been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses and Preliminary Biological Evaluations of the Dibromopyrrole&#8208;Containing Marine Natural Products Agesasine A, Agesasine B, Longamide E and Various Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of the title marine natural products have been achieved and so confirming the structures originally assigned to them. Upon subjecting agesasine A and its corresponding ethyl ester to Mitsunobu conditions a 1,5&#8208;cyclodehydration reaction takes place to give 2&#8208;oxazolines. In contrast, on subjecting agesasine B to the same Mitsunobu conditions then a simple dehydration reaction occurs to give the corresponding acrylate. A total synthesis of longamide E was achieved by engaging a 1,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrole in a lactam&#8208;forming reaction and this was followed by a two&#8208;fold and fully regio&#8208;controlled bromination reaction. A distinctly different and possibly biomimetic route was used to synthesize, via the open&#8208;chain natural product nakamurine B, longamide B and its methyl ester. Preliminary biological evaluations of the title alkaloids and various analogues against a small human cancer cell line panel reveals cytotoxic properties that vary significantly with structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Generated Cu(I) Catalyzed Click Chemistry: Triazole Synthesis and Insights into their Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the electro&#8208;click (e&#8208;CLICK) reaction via electrochemically generated copper(I) catalytic species. The reaction worked under constant potential electrolysis (&#8722;0.25 V) with copper(II) nitrate and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine serving as pre&#8208;catalyst and ligand respectively. The reaction accommodates electronically different organic azides to afford 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in good synthetic yields with excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity. Compared to traditional click chemistry, the developed e&#8208;CLICK methodology avoids the use of external reducing agent such as sodium ascorbate. Absorptive properties of the resulting triazole products were assessed by UV&#8208;visible electronic spectra. The selected triazole (3e) was further applied for the spectrophotometric detection of Co2+ and Cu2+ species.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Camptothecin&#8208;like Scaffolds: Construction of a New Class of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of novel small molecules endowed with high 3D&#8208;content remains a powerful tool for interrogating underrepresented biological space. To this end, the pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NP) strategy has become one of the most important tools to deliver biologically significant chemical probes. In this article, we describe the development of a new class of pseudo&#8208;NP collection, through connecting tryptamines with a furanose derivative followed by subjecting the product from this operation to a ring distortion strategy that led to diasteoselective synthesis of camptothecin&#8208;like compounds. This process is driven by a cascade that unites Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction with Michael addition reaction, followed by oxidative&#8208;ring enlargement and subsequent transannular aldol cyclization delivering camptothecin&#8208;like architectures. The obtained diastereoselectivity was verified using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidynamic Crystalline Molecular Rotors Comprising an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Binuclear Au(I) Complex Bearing Multiple Rotators</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report multi&#8208;dynamic molecular rotations in crystals using a concave&#8208;shape N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) binuclear Au(I) complex rotor bearing pyrazine and tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecules as multicomponent rotators. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed that two THF molecules are located near the central pyrazine encapsulated by two bulky NHC ligands. From 2H solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, it was observed that the pyrazine rotated in a 2&#8208;fold site exchange with a 180&#176; rotational angle and a 31 kJ mol&#8211;1 energy barrier, while the THF molecules showed a 23&#176;&#8211;38&#176; libration with a lower energy barrier (14 kJ mol&#8211;1). Interestingly, the pyrazine rotation was accelerated when the THF molecules rotated in fast site exchange with a large angle of libration, suggesting that the rotators exhibit multi&#8208;dynamics in a correlated manner.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly functionalized quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones were synthesized from reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzamides with trialkylamines under photocatalytic conditions by using eosin Y (EY) as a catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in aqueous acetonitrile and has a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies disclosed the electron&#8208;donor nature of the intermediate 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one (3&#8217;) in the photocatalytic cycle to afford the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones (3). This methodology has been extended to synthesize benzo [4,5] imidazole[1,2&#8208;c] quinazolines and 3aa on a large scale. Furthermore, the synthesis of potent central nervous system depressant (CNS) drug molecules such as methaqualone (3la) and mecloqualone (3pa) was also achieved successfully.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A highly strained 1,3&#8208;fused cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic system appeared among various presilphiperfolanol analogues is reported for the first time. The cis&#8208;fusion of a six&#8208;membered ring to diquinane moiety is accomplished by substrate&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselective epoxidation. The target compound, cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic ketone with oxirane ring serves as a key building block to produce several biologically important molecules.







Abstract
Here, we report a new synthetic approach to a highly strained 1,3&#8208;fused cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic system that appeared among the presilphiperfolanol analogues. The cis&#8208;fusion of six&#8208;membered ring to a diquinane moiety is accomplished by substrate&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselective epoxidation, and ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) sequence. In this regard, both early&#8208;, and late&#8208;stage epoxidation and RRM reactions were studied. The target compound, cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6 tricyclic ketone with an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;oxirane ring can serve as a key building block to produce various presilphiperfolanol analogues. The cis&#8208;cis&#8208;cis&#8208;5/5/6&#8208;tricyclic&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone can also act as masked enone and therefore useful for various chemical transformations in organic synthesis. The short synthetic sequence disclosed here may be useful to design various biologically important molecules. The newly reported molecules are well&#8208;characterized by NMR, HRMS, and IR spectral data.

         <title>Sulfur Monoxide Release and Capture: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical computations reveal that thiirane oxide decomposes through a stepwise diradical mechanism producing triplet ground state sulfur monoxide. This pathway is preferred over the alternative singlet concerted mechanism despite the need for a spin state change.







Abstract
Thermolysis of thiirane oxide leads to production of highly reactive sulfur monoxide. The liberated SO can in turn be trapped with a diene scavenger forming dihydrothiophene oxide. Since the intermediate diatomic possesses a triplet ground state, the SO transfer can proceed on two spin&#8208;state surfaces. Here, we study the competition between singlet concerted and stepwise triplet diradical mechanisms utilizing the M06&#8208;2X density functional as well as CCSD(T) and MRCI+Q wavefunction theories. We find that the decomposition of thiirane oxide prefers to pass through a triplet diradical intermediate that becomes accessible from a nearby minimum energy crossing point (MECP). Hence, the thermolysis of thiirane oxide is expected to predominantly release triplet ground state sulfur monoxide in agreement with previous experimental reports. The addition of 3SO to 1,3&#8208;butadiene initially generates an allylic diradical, that ring&#8208;closes to a thiirane oxide through another MECP, and a subsequent rearrangement gives access to the final product.

         <title>New Advances in the Synthesis of Emerging Cyclic Amidrazones to Foster Bioisosterism of Azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Omnipresent both in nature and in synthetic chemistry, azaheterocycles constitute essential molecular units that are found in natural products, in medicinal chemistry, in materials, catalysis, and so on. This work discloses a robust method to access original cyclic amidrazones as new scaffold within an uncharted chemical space.







Abstract
The pace and the scope of new molecules design is often constrained by limitations in synthetic chemistry. The azaheterocyclic amidrazones are of particular interest for bioisosteric considerations in drug discovery. However, the lack of efficient synthetic access has undoubtedly hampered their occurrence in the drug chemical space. Our current results describe a robust synthetic access relying on cyclization of aminohydrazine in presence of various orthoesters by either metal free&#8208; or metal&#8208;catalyzed condensations. This optimized synthetic access to cyclic amidrazones as original scaffold should inspire the chemist community and further drive innovation in the design of molecular structure for many applications (for example, drugs, materials, dyes).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;Salox complexes are suitable catalysts for the reduction of prochiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. These ligands can be prepared in a single step from available and inexpensive materials, thus representing an easily accessible alternative to previously reported Co&#8208;catalysts. NaBH4 is employed as reducing agent in the presence of EtOH as proton source, leading to the stereoselective formation of chiral esters, amides, and nitriles in up to 99% yield and 96.5:3.5 er. The concentration of the reductant counter cation (Na+) and the solvent polarity have been shown to correlate with reactivity and enantioselectivity, suggesting that a relatively complex mechanistic manifold is in place.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Studies of Thermoresponsive Copper (I) Complex towards Click Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ensure the easy removal of Copper catalyst after click reaction, a thermoresponsive polymer (PNIPAM) is incorporated. As a result, through the volume phase transition behavior of PNIPAM, the catalyst can easily be removed from the system by simply heating.







Abstract
Click reaction or copper&#8208;assisted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can conveniently synthesize desired organic molecules or functionalize biological macromolecules. In many cases, trace amounts of residual copper from the reaction mixture are not trivial to remove when the exhaustive purification step is avoided to fulfill the essential criteria of a click reaction. It is often detrimental, particularly for biochemical applications or when it involves biological macromolecules. Herein, we have reported the synthesis of a new type of copper (I) complex as a smart catalyst for click reaction, which can be separated from the reaction mixture very easily by the slight elevation of temperature, thanks to its thermoresponsive behavior. The click reactions using a thermoresponsive catalyst were first studied in an aqueous medium using various organic molecules containing alkyne and azide functional groups. Later, the strategy was extended to biological macromolecules like collagen.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Emissive Fluorophores Based on Multiply Stacked Anthracene Arrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly designed fluorophore systems with feather&#8208;like structures were constructed by connecting bisanthracene building units via a concise reaction sequence. Spectroscopic characterizations revealed that all of the fluorophore systems achieved high light absorptivity and high emission efficiency by preventing closely spaced anthracene chromophores from mutual interactions to reduce concomitant energy loss by fluorescence quenching.







Abstract
Newly designed fluorophore systems with feather&#8208;like structures were constructed by connecting bisanthracene building units via a concise reaction sequence of bromination, etherification, and desilylation. Spectroscopic characterizations revealed that all of the fluorophore systems achieved high light absorptivity and high emission efficiency by preventing closely spaced anthracene chromophores from mutual interactions to reduce concomitant energy loss by fluorescence quenching. The application of fluorophore systems for the preparation of light&#8208;harvesting dyad materials has successfully demonstrated their potential utility as versatile photofunctional tools.

&lt;p&gt;Newly designed fluorophore systems with feather-like structures were constructed by connecting bisanthracene building units via a concise reaction sequence. Spectroscopic characterizations revealed that all of the fluorophore systems achieved high light absorptivity and high emission efficiency by preventing closely spaced anthracene chromophores from mutual interactions to reduce concomitant energy loss by fluorescence quenching.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly designed fluorophore systems with feather-like structures were constructed by connecting bisanthracene building units via a concise reaction sequence of bromination, etherification, and desilylation. Spectroscopic characterizations revealed that all of the fluorophore systems achieved high light absorptivity and high emission efficiency by preventing closely spaced anthracene chromophores from mutual interactions to reduce concomitant energy loss by fluorescence quenching. The application of fluorophore systems for the preparation of light-harvesting dyad materials has successfully demonstrated their potential utility as versatile photofunctional tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>O&#8208;Acylative Vinylation of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxane Towards Rotaxane Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Random acylation of cyclodextrin (CD) was revealed to highly depend on the steric hindrance of the reagent. Based on this phenomenon, the facile synthesis of a [3]rotaxane crosslinker was implemented via random methacrylation without any demanding synthetic process. The mono&#8208;modification of CD is known to be useful but demanding work; however, we propose a novel process for overcoming this trade&#8208;off, promoting both convenience and usefulness.







Abstract
The acylation of a cyclodextrin&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was implemented with anhydride reagents following a facile procedure. Methacrylic anhydride facilitated the introduction of a vinyl&#8208;group into the rotaxane structure toward achieving a crosslinker. Interestingly, only a few methacrylic units were attached to the cyclodextrin at reaction temperatures of up to 60&#8201;&#176;C even with an excess amount of the reagent, probably due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the number of vinyl groups on the [3]rotaxane framework was easily controlled to be approximately two units via a simple random acylation, which worked effectively as a facile synthesis route for the rotaxane crosslinker. The acylation behavior was investigated in detail by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analyses. Such a proposed approach will help overcome the trade&#8208;off between convenience and utility associated with the mono&#8208;modification of cyclodextrins.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization for Syntheses of Azaoxa&#8208; and Diazaspirocycles
</title>

         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Azaspirocycles represent an important structural motif found in many approved drugs and natural products. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop efficient catalytic systems to access this scaffold. This work reports the synthesis of various azaoxa&#8208; and diazaspirocycles from alkynes bearing two pendant nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles under silver catalysis.







Abstract
1&#8208;Azaspirocycles are important structures present in many drugs and natural products. This work describes the silver&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization strategy, which provides atom&#8208;economical access to various azaoxa&#8208; and diazaspirocycles from alkynes containing two appended oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Intramolecular attack of the pendant nucleophile on the in situ&#8208;generated iminium intermediate is the key to the success of this transformation.

         <title>Stereodivergent Transformation of Azepino[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indoles En Route to Nature&#8208;Inspired Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

An efficient and step&#8208;economic strategy was established that enables a facile access to highly functionalized azepino[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indole architectures through a cascade combining Pictet&#8208;Spengler and Michael addition. Employing a late&#8208;stage transformation strategy on the developed azepino&#8208;[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indoles, provided a modular, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective access to diverse collection of nature&#8208;inspired frameworks, namely spiro[azepino[2,3,4,5&#8208;def]carbazole&#8208;5,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclohexan]&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;ene systems.







Abstract
Azepino[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indole derivatives represent the core scaffold of important natural products and biologically relevant compounds. Therefore, the establishment of step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic strategies to access this class of compounds is of paramount importance. To this end, complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity (CtD) strategy has become one of the most important tools that transforms complex molecules into diverse skeleta. However, many of the reactions that could be employed in CtD are restricted by the functional handles exist in these molecules. This limits the achievement of the desired skeletal diversity. Herein, an efficient and step&#8208;economic strategy to access a diverse collection of azepino&#8208;[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indole architectures through a cascade that combines Pictet&#8208;Spengler with Michael addition, is described. This was achieved by reacting cyclohexadienone acetaldehydes 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d with indolyl&#8208;4&#8208;ethyl amine 1. Employing a CtD strategy on the developed azepino&#8208;[3,4,5&#8208;cd]indoles, a rapid rearrangement reaction that provided a modular, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective access to diverse collection of spiro azepinocarbazole nature&#8208;inspired frameworks, was encountered.

         <title>Kekul&#233;&#8217;s Oscillating D3h Cyclohexatriene Structure of Benzene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kekul&#233;&#8217;s attempts in 1872 to arrive at a fully symmetrical (D6h) benzene structure by means of intramolecular C&#8722;C collisions only resulted in the oscillating D3h cyclohexatrienes, which would have become static at zero K.







Abstract
Kekul&#233; postulated that neighbouring carbon atoms in benzene undergo incessant collision with each other, thereby leading to the interchange of double and single bonds, which amounts to an oscillation between two cyclohexatriene structures in dynamic equilibrium. It has been claimed that Kekul&#233; arrived at a fully symmetric D6h structure of benzene and that the oscillation hypothesis should not be attributed to him. However, Clausius&#8217; collision theory, which was known at the time, implies that, when the absolute temperature approaches zero, the collision frequency will tend toward zero too, i.e. collisions will stop, and a static, D3h cyclohexatriene obtains. The classical collision theory did not allow Kekul&#233; to construct the desired D6h structure as the energy minimum. The theory of harmonic oscillators would have allowed it, but that was not attempted at Kekul&#233;&#8217;s time.

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structure of benzene and that the oscillation hypothesis should not be attributed to him. However, Clausius&#8217; collision theory, which was known at the time, implies that, when the absolute temperature approaches zero, the collision frequency will tend toward zero too, i.e. collisions will stop, and a static, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; cyclohexatriene obtains. The classical collision theory did not allow Kekul&#233; to construct the desired &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structure as the energy minimum. The theory of harmonic oscillators would have allowed it, but that was not attempted at Kekul&#233;&#8217;s time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Betuphenone F (6) is a natural product isolated from the bark of Betula alnoides Ham. ex D. Don (Betulaceae) and structurally determined by S. Awale et al. in 2021.

         <title>Syntheses and Structures of Facial and Meridional Stereoisomers of &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;Chelated Ruthenium Borate Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;mer&#8208; and cis&#8208;fac&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated ruthenium borate complexes have been synthesised from the thermolysis of trans&#8208;mer isomers. The hemilability of the flexible borate ligand is one of the key factors for the formation of these isomers.







Abstract
The trans&#8208;mer&#8208;[(&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;NS2C7H4)PR3Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;H2B (NS2C7H4)2}], (trans&#8208;mer&#8208;1&#8201;a: R=Cy; trans&#8208;mer&#8208;1&#8201;b: R=Ph) complexes are kinetically controlled products that upon thermolysis led to the formation of cis&#8208;mer&#8208;[(&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;NS2C7H4)PR3Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;H2B(NS2C7H4)2}], (cis&#8208;mer&#8208;2&#8201;a: R=Cy; cis&#8208;mer&#8208;2&#8201;b: R=Ph) and cis&#8208;fac&#8208;[(&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;NS2C7H4)PR3Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;H2B(NS2C7H4)2}], (cis&#8208;fac&#8208;3&#8201;a: R=Cy; cis&#8208;fac&#8208;3&#8201;b: R=Ph) along with complex cis&#8208;[(&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;NS2C7H4)2Ru(PPh3)2], (cis&#8208;4). One of the main intentions of this study was to examine the flexibility of the borate and hemilabile N,S&#8208;chelating mercapto&#8208;benzothiazole ligands in adapting different spatial arrangements around metal center. Multinuclear spectroscopic analyses have been done to characterize all new complexes and the structures were further confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Further, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide an insight into the bonding of the complexes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Light&#8208;Mediated, Site&#8208;Specific, Radical C6&#8722;H Alkylation of Purines with Alcohols Intervened by Oxalates without Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical protocol for highly regioselective C6&#8722;H alkylation of purines with alcohols intervened by oxalates under blue LED irradiation is reported. This transformation does not need transition metal catalysts, is not sensitive to moisture and does not require N2 protection. Besides, this method displays broad functional groups compatibility and is easily scale up.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of a radical deoxy&#8208;functionalization strategy for the direct C&#8722;H alkylation of purines and purine nucleosides with alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;) intervened by oxalates under 12&#8197;W blue LED irradiation. The reaction shows high regioselectivity at C6&#8722;H position of purine and is suitable for N9&#8208;, N7&#8208;substitued purines. The process accommodates purines and alcohols to deliver a wide range of products (31 examples) in 41&#8211;91&#8201;% yields, which avoids transition metal catalysts and organometallic reagents, and is not sensitive to moisture and air. Besides, the mild protocol displays broad functional groups tolerance and is easily up scalable to gram scale and can be used for late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H alkylation of purine to synthesize pharmaceutical 6&#8208;cyclopentyl nebularine with anti&#8208;CEM activity or natural d&#8208;menthol modification.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows chalkboard drawings of recent advances in the use of Katritzky salts as intermediates for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides, and macrocyclization. Thanks to the progress made in deaminative strategies using Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed in the peptide chemistry field. Peptide drug development will greatly benefit from the novel methodologies to expand the chemical space explored around peptides and biomolecules. Cover design realized by Yousif.

     alt="Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late-Stage Functionalization of Peptides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Front Cover&lt;/b&gt; shows chalkboard drawings of recent advances in the use of Katritzky salts as intermediates for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, late-stage functionalization of peptides, and macrocyclization. Thanks to the progress made in deaminative strategies using Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed in the peptide chemistry field. Peptide drug development will greatly benefit from the novel methodologies to expand the chemical space explored around peptides and biomolecules. Cover design realized by Yousif.

The Cover Feature shows a shot pendulum symbolizing the group transfer reaction studied in our paper. The balls of the pendulum represent the functional groups participating in the GTR, which are the thiol group and the ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediate. The latter is represented on two balls as it consists of two separate groups: the naphthalene framework and the chiral amine. The &#8220;thiol&#8208;ball&#8221; swings towards the other two balls and only when they collide, the &#8220;amine&#8208;ball&#8221; swings away &#8211; just as it is the case in the GTR. In addition, the energy diagram of the GT reaction is shown in the background. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Beeck and H. A. Wegner.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biomedical Applications of Glycotripods for Targeting Trimeric Lectins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripodal glycoconjugates have been widely explored to target trimeric lectins that are present on the surface of hepatic cells, immune cells, and viruses. Glycotripods with stringent binding to trimeric lectins have been investigated as potential drug candidates or for drug targeting. These controlled systems possess high potential in different clinical applications.







Abstract
In the last decades, various efforts have been made to synthesize optimal glycotripods for targeting trimeric glycoproteins like asialoglycoprotein receptor, hemagglutinin, and langerin. All these trimeric glycoproteins have sugar binding pockets which are highly selective for a particular carbohydrate ligand. Optimized glycotripods are high affinity binders and have been used for delivering drugs or even applied as drug candidates. The selection of the tripodal base scaffold together with the length and flexibility of the linker between the scaffold and sugar residue, as important design parameters are discussed in this review.

         <title>Synthesis of Bifunctional Lipoxin&#8208;Derived Enzyme&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules (LipET&#8208;CORMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploratory drug design: To test whether a conjugate of an esterase&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule and a lipoxin analog would exhibit superior biological properties, two such LipET&#8208;CORMs were prepared by chemical synthesis and their anti&#8208;inflammatory potential was investigated in cellular assays.







Abstract
In an attempt to develop new anti&#8208;inflammatory agents which act by co&#8208;release of carbon monoxide (CO) and a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, we designed conjugates of a lipoxin A4 analogue and an acyloxycyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complex as an esterase&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM). After adjustment of the protecting group strategy, two of such compounds were successfully prepared by total synthesis (12 steps; 4&#8211;5&#8201;% overall yield) starting from deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribose and exploiting a Wittig olefination and an intermolecular Heck reaction as key C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming steps. A crucial late reduction of an aryl&#8208;ketone moiety in the presence of a highly sensitive dienol ester functionality was achieved with BH3&#8208;SMe2 in the presence of catalytic amounts of NaBH4. Both target compounds were dose&#8208;dependently toxic towards cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with LipET&#8208;CORM 1&#8208;A being slightly more toxic. While induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) in HUVEC was observed for both compounds, they did not inhibit TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;mediated VCAM&#8208;1 expression in these cells. In M2 polarized macrophages HO&#8208;1 expression was more pronounced as compared to M1 polarized macrophages. In both types of macrophages HO&#8208;1 expression was downregulated by lipopolysaccharide, but only in M2 macrophages HO&#8208;1 expression was rescued by LipET&#8208;CORM. 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase (15&#8208;LO) was only expressed in M2 macrophages and was not influenced by LipET&#8208;CORM. Collectively our data demonstrate that LipET&#8208;CORMs induce HO&#8208;1 expression in endothelial cells and M2 polarized macrophages. The role of the intra&#8208;cellular released lipoxin A4 in resolution of inflammation, however, remains to be assessed.

         <title>Towards Green Reductions in Bio&#8208;Derived Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation processes, and all the reactions that formally add two hydrogen atoms to an unsaturated bond, are among the most used transformations in the manufacture of bulk and fine chemicals. Although their potential as powerful tool for the sustainable synthesis of organic compounds, hydrogenations, and more generally the reductions, have been typically carried out in volatile organic solvents deriving from petroleum; indeed, all studies and fascinating advances related to the catalysts activity or the reducing agents reactivity have been limited to such volatile and often toxic reaction media. In this review, recent advances in the reducing methodologies with an improved degree of sustainability, have been described. In particular, a series of examples have been reported to highlight the chance to reduce an organic compound by using a benign solvent deriving from renewable sources, without waiving to the process efficiency and selectivity. Some important key point of green chemistry, such as the easiness of catalyst recovery or the simplicity of product isolation, have been considered in the choice of the described studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of New Cytotoxic Aplaminone Derivatives from the Sea Hare Aplysia kurodai and Elucidation of Their Accumulation from Local Sea Algae through the Food Chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shell&#8208;less herbivorous marine mollusk (sea hare)&#160;Aplysia kurodai, is known to contain a variety of bioactive substances. While these compounds have been thought to originate from sea algae or their associated microbes, most of their origin and acquisition pathways are still unclear. Six new cytotoxic aplaminone derivatives, bromodopamine&#8211;terpenoid hybrid molecules, were isolated from&#160;A. kurodai. Among them, isoaplaminone had a reverse prenyl group at the C15 aliphatic chain, which is a rare structural feature from the viewpoint of terpenoid biosynthesis. Investigation for chemical components in&#160;A. kurodai&#160;and the sea algae collected at several different locations revealed that two major aplaminones were contained in the&#160;Laurencia&#160;complex species at specific sites. Our chemical and ecological studies provide new insights into the origin of marine alkaloid toxins and their dynamism through the food chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic Addition of N&#8208;Acyl Radicals: In Batch and In Flow Organophotoredox &#945;&#8208;Amination of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective organo photocatalytic addition of N&#8208;acyl radical to aldehydes was studied in batch and under continuous flow conditions, with different homemade photoreactors, affording chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in up to 85&#8201;% e.e. In&#8208;flow process afforded the product in higher productivities (60&#8197;times higher) and improved space time yields (increased up to 113&#8197;times) compared to the batch reactions.







Abstract
The organophotoredox catalytic enantioselective addition of N&#8208;acyl radicals to aldehydes, to afford enantioenriched N&#8208;acyl 1,2 aminoalcohols was studied. Under the best conditions, in batch, the product was isolated in up to 52&#8201;% yield and 85&#8201;% e.e., using a low cost and commercially available chiral imidazolidinone as organocatalyst. The reaction was then studied in flow, exploring different experimental setups and photoreactors. Although modest yields were obtained, the in&#8208;flow process afforded the product in higher productivities (up to 60&#8197;times higher) and improved space time yields (increased up to 113&#8197;times) compared to the batch reaction, with no loss of stereoselectivity.

         <title>The Role of Dethreading Process in Pseudorotaxanes and Rotaxanes towards Advanced Applications: Recent Examples</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxanes are a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), constituted by at least a thread surrounded by a wheel, which are widely employed in the research field of artificial molecular machines. Although applications retaining the integrity of the mechanical bond are usually reported, the dethreading of the components can be crucial in order to develop some advanced applications. Thus, different dethreading strategies have been reported and also advanced applications which require such a process have turned out to be suitable approaches towards machine&#8208;like operation. This review article covers recent examples of applications of pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes in which dethreading processes have a key role to accomplish the desired function.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A library of nine HBC&#8208;alkyne hybrids with enlarged &#960;&#8208;systems is presented. The iodide HBC served as a very suitable starting material for double Sonogashira reactions with several phenyl&#8208; or quinoxaline&#8208;based coupling partners. Spectroscopic analyses were performed and discussed as the varied substitution pattern changed the optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Within the scope of this paper, nine &#960;&#8208;expanded mono&#8208;substituted 5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBC) are introduced. 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene served as precursor and was reacted with ethynyltrimethylsilane in a Sonogashira coupling reaction. The acetylene unit is used as a linker and can undergo another Sonogashira coupling reaction combining different phenyl coupling partners with the HBC core. The electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as nitrile, pyridine and carbonyl species (aldehyde, methylester, carboxylic acid) as well as the three quinoxaline based species (diphenylquinoxaline, dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine) serve as substitution moieties. Their influence on the optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy demonstrating a maximum redshift of 7&#8197;nm compared to starting compound 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl) HBC. As for the phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substituted HBC a dramatic decrease in the intensity of the absorption of the UV/Vis spectrum was observed. The fluorescence spectroscopy pointed out that the dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and phenanthro[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substitution changed the spectra to one broad peak departing from the characteristic HBC&#8208;like emission pattern.

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;4 picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.







Abstract
The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable cis&#8208;&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;4 configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.

         <title>Tailoring the Chemical Structure of Cellulose Nanocrystals by Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals is presently considered a useful and straightforward tool for accessing very reliable biocompatible and biodegradable nanostructures with tailored physical and chemical properties. However, to date the fine characterization of the chemical appendages introduced onto cellulose nanocrystals remains a challenge, due to the low sensitivity displayed by the most common techniques towards surface functionalization. In this paper, we demonstrate the easy functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals with aliphatic and aromatic amines, demonstrating the tunability of their properties in dependence on the selected functionality. Then, we apply to colloidal suspensions of modified nanocrystals 1H&#8208;NMR analysis to elucidate their surface structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where such investigation was performed on cellulose nanocrystals presenting both surface and reducing end modification. These results involve interesting implications for the fields of Cultural Heritage and of Materials Chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>First Total Synthesis of the Benzotropolone/Bis(pulvinone) Natural Product Aurantricholone Exploiting New Strategies for Establishing Benzotropolones and Z&#8208;Configured Pulvinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal colorant aurantricholone was synthesized in 15&#8197;steps. Its benzotropolone core resulted from 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethoxytetral&#8208;1&#8208;one in 3&#8197;steps which included a 1&#8208;pot ring&#8208;enlargement/oxidation/acetylation sequence. A regioselective 2&#8208;step bromination allowed two Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a new tetronate building block to ensue in one go. Deprotection (2&#8197;steps) gave protonated aurantricholone or its Li or Ca salt.







Abstract
Aurantricholone as well as its calcium and lithium salts, all of which represent the coloring principle of the fungus Tricholoma aurantium, were synthesized for the first time, namely in 15&#8197;steps, 10 of which were our longest linear sequence. We developed an access to benzotropolones after dibromocyclopropanating alkyl or silyl enol ethers of 1&#8208;tetralones. Successive treatments with DMAP&#8208;N&#8208;oxide and Ac2O effected ring&#8208;enlargement, oxidation, and acetylation. O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzotropolone obtained thereby &#8211; similarly as unsubstituted benzotropolone &#8211; was brominated at C&#8208;8 in two steps by adopting our recently published bromination protocol for otherwise unsubstituted O&#8208;acetylbenzotropolone. Thereafter, a double and doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki&#8208;coupling with a newly introduced boronate established the O&#8208;methylated pulvinone moiety as well as the O&#8208;methylated &#8220;pulvinone&#8208;like&#8221; motif of what altogether equaled the completed aurantricholone scaffold. Its deprotection (two steps) furnished the title compound either as its protonated form or its calcium or lithium salt.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Sulfinate Migration Triggered by &#945;&#8208;Imino Carbene and Divergent Zwitterion Cyclization: Synthesis of Cyclopropane, Dihydropyrrole, and Azepane Ring Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three birds with one stone: A convenient divergent synthetic strategy was established by regulation on the intramolecular annulation modes of zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites, yielding various functionalized 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings.







Abstract
Cyclopropane, dihydropyrrole, and azepane ring systems were synthesized conveniently from sulfinate&#8208;tethered triazoles. The divergent synthetic strategy started with the unique 1,3&#8208;sulfinate migration of an &#945;&#8208;imino carbene. The efficient reaction allowed control of the zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites depending on the increased stability of the resulting carbocation and anion. The sulfinate was converted to a sulfone after the group migration, and a stable anion bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing groups was thus formed. Catalytic amounts of iodide acted as a switch for the synthesis of cyclopropanes and dihydropyrroles. The reaction merits including readily available substrates, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility qualified this protocol a possible synthetic tool for cyclic compounds, especially for N&#8208;heterocycles.

     alt="1,3-Sulfinate Migration Triggered by &#945;-Imino Carbene and Divergent Zwitterion Cyclization: Synthesis of Cyclopropane, Dihydropyrrole, and Azepane Ring Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three birds with one stone: A convenient divergent synthetic strategy was established by regulation on the intramolecular annulation modes of zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites, yielding various functionalized 3-, 5-, and 7-membered rings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclopropane, dihydropyrrole, and azepane ring systems were synthesized conveniently from sulfinate-tethered triazoles. The divergent synthetic strategy started with the unique 1,3-sulfinate migration of an &#945;-imino carbene. The efficient reaction allowed control of the zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites depending on the increased stability of the resulting carbocation and anion. The sulfinate was converted to a sulfone after the group migration, and a stable anion bearing two electron-withdrawing groups was thus formed. Catalytic amounts of iodide acted as a switch for the synthesis of cyclopropanes and dihydropyrroles. The reaction merits including readily available substrates, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility qualified this protocol a possible synthetic tool for cyclic compounds, especially for N-heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Last Fortress of Tin's Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods used for the protodenitration of nitroalkanes were reviewed. Despite several decades of intense research, the most frequently used option remains the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing toxic tributyltin hydride. Thus, the protodenitration of nitroalkanes remains the last fortress of the tyranny of tin.







Abstract
Protodenitration, a direct reduction of nitroalkanes to corresponding alkanes, already spans two centuries and is enabled by various reagents. This mini&#8208;review provides a historical development of the fundamental transformation and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride and environmentally unpopular solvents sharply contrasting with modern ecological trends, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin's tyranny.&#8221;

         <title>Flexible Synthesis of Benzofuranones from ortho&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols or Benzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two flexible methods for synthesizing benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones are developed, with easily available starting materials, good chemoselectivity, and very mild conditions. One protocol for benzofuranone is a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of o&#8208;alkynyl phenol with alcohol or acid. Another metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzofuranone is the treatment of benzofuran with alcohol, acid, or H2O.







Abstract
Benzofuranones are attractive synthetic targets in medicinal and natural products. The cycloisomerization of o&#8208;alkynyl phenol to benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one is reported here using gold(I) and Selectfluor. This benzofuranone can also be obtained from benzofuran without a gold catalyst. This study presents two appealing synthetic methods for benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones that use readily available starting materials, have high chemoselectivity and operate under very mild conditions.

         <title>Detours in the Development of the Organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Vinylboronic Compounds. A Dead End?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical and experimental studies were performed to further optimize the organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of vinylboronic compounds. Although the yields and the stereoselectivities could not be improved much, a simpler procedure is described. In addition, a deeper knowledge into the reaction mechanism has been achieved, particularly on the substituent effect of the catalyst and the ligand exchange.







Abstract
Attempts to improve the organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of vinylboronic compounds are described. Further experiments, theoretical calculations and NMR studies were performed to optimize the existing procedure and analyze the reactivity of the reactive intermediate and the ligand&#8208;exchange process. In particular, the relationship between the structure and the performance of the organocatalysts was studied theoretically and experimentally. Although the catalytic activity of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids could not be improved much, a deeper insight has been gained, which might be useful for the development of other organocatalytic reactions of organoboron compounds.

         <title>Macrocyclic Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids and Silphiperfolanol Angelate Esters from Solanecio mannii</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids and a silphiperfolanol angelate ester were isolated from the Rwandan medicinal herb Solanecio mannii. The relative configuration of senaetnine was determined by NAMFIS analysis. Synthetic modification of 5 provided two new compounds, 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphiperfolane and 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphi&#8208;perfolane. Some of the compounds showed strong cytotoxicity but weak antibacterial activities.







Abstract
Three new compounds, the silphiperfolanol angelate ester umutagarananol (1), the macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids umutagarinine A and B (2&#8211;3), and five known secondary metabolites (4&#8211;8) were isolated from the CH2Cl2&#8722;MeOH (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) extract of the roots and the stem bark of Solanecio mannii (Hook. f.) (Asteraceae). The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric analyses, whereas the relative stereochemistry of 4 was established by NAMFIS&#8208;based combined computational and solution NMR analysis. Synthetic modification of 5 provided two new compounds, 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphiperfolane (9) and 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphi&#8208;perfolane (10). The crude extracts and the isolated constituents showed weak antibacterial activities (EC50 0.7&#8211;13.3&#8197;mM) against the Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and the Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis. Compounds 2, 3 and 4 exhibited strong cytotoxicity against MCF&#8208;7 human breast cancer cells, with EC50 values of 35.6, 21.7 and 12.5&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric analyses, whereas the relative stereochemistry of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; was established by NAMFIS-based combined computational and solution NMR analysis. Synthetic modification of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; provided two new compounds, 2-angeloyloxy-4,8-epoxypresilphiperfolane (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) and 2-angeloyloxy-4,8-epoxypresilphi-perfolane (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;). The crude extracts and the isolated constituents showed weak antibacterial activities (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 0.7&#8211;13.3&#8197;mM) against the Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and the Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibited strong cytotoxicity against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 35.6, 21.7 and 12.5&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allylsulfones through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two distinct protocols for the preparation of allylsulfones via Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H activation. While the former protocol consists of a direct Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the latter involves a sequential one&#8208;pot Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation.







Abstract
Two previously unknown protocols for Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H sulfonylation of terminal alkenes have been developed. While the former consists of a direct Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the latter involves a sequential one&#8208;pot Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation. The scope of both protocols was studied on 25 examples.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxyl&#8208;Yne Click Reaction: A Powerful Tool toward Red&#8208;Emitting Nontraditional Small Organic Luminogens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction has been successfully established, which was a powerful tool for the preparation of red&#8208;emitting nontraditional small organic luminogens.







Abstract
Nontraditional small organic luminogens (NTSOLs) without classic conjugated chromophores have attracted significant attention. However, the design and synthesis of NTSOLs with fluorescence in the red region remain significantly challenging. In this study, we established a self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction for preparing long&#8208;wavelength and red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs. Owing to their perfect reaction selectivity, high efficiency, and excellent universality, a series of compounds with well&#8208;defined structures were obtained in high yields. Moreover, the obtained compounds showed concentration&#8208;enhanced and excitation&#8208;dependent emission characteristics. The compounds also exhibited dramatical chemical structure&#8208;dependent and aggregation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted fluorescence properties, based on which we successfully obtained red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs by simply adjusting chemical structure and concentration. Also, the compounds show good cell staining ability, which can be used in cell imaging.

         <title>Superbase&#8208;Catalyzed Steric&#8208;Hindrance&#8208;Induced Dimerization of Alkynones to Highly Functionalized Furans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel superbase&#8208;catalyzed dimerization pathways of widely&#8208;applicable substrates, namely alkynones, have been discovered and thoroughly studied.







Abstract
The cascade dimerization of alkynones bearing sterically hindered secondary alkyl groups at the carbonyl function has unexpectedly furnished highly functionalized furans. The reaction efficiently occurs in the presence of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide/dimethylsulfoxide superbase catalytic system at room temperature. Alkynones having additional C&#8722;H active site at the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond have followed another dimerization pathway to afford 3&#8208;alkenylpyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones. The discovery of these reactions expands the traditional knowledge about the reactivity of alkynones in strong basic medium.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaspiro Tricyclic Scaffolds through Post&#8208;Ugi Modifications: Scope and Limitation of Aza&#8208;Michael Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores efficient post&#8208;Ugi modification strategies to synthesize azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds with detailed investigation of aza&#8208;Michael cyclizations.







Abstract
Post&#8208;Ugi modifications offer a great tool to construct functionalized heterocycles in an atom&#8208;economic manner. Using this approach, we have constructed highly functionalized azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds that involve Ugi condensation and ipso&#8208;cyclization followed by aza&#8208;Michael ring closures. Herein, we present a detailed account of aza&#8208;Michael cyclizations with respect to substrate scope and limitations, along with new methods to prepare novel azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds.

         <title>A Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;Type Alkenylation Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy: A Rare Example of C&#8722;C Bond Formation towards the C2&#8208;Carbon of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the olefination in ortho&#8208;position to a carboxylic acid group by employing simple olefins which do not carry electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The acid initially acts as the directing group but is subsequently removed by decarboxylation. The process introduces an alkene in meta&#8208;position to an electron donating residue, which is complementary to classical electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;type reaction of unactivated terminal alkenes and benzoic acid derivatives bearing electron donating residues under mild conditions. The acid functionality acts as a traceless directing group delivering products alkenylated in meta&#8208;position to the electron donating substituent in contrast to the usually obtained ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;substitution in Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reactions. Remarkably, the new C&#8722;C bond is formed to the C2 of the terminal olefin, in contrast to similar reported transformations. Initially formed mixtures of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;double bond isomers can be efficiently isomerized to the more stable endo&#8208;products.

         <title>Quantifying Vertical Resonance Energy in Aromatic Systems with Natural Bond Orbitals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deleting &#960;NBO&#8594;&#960;*NBO interactions for a series of benzenoids and non&#8208;benzenoid systems returns energies that correlate with existing magnetic criteria of aromaticity (NICS). Thus, aromaticity can in principle be intuitively understood through interactions between typical 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bonding orbitals. The method is used to investigate properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and non&#8208;planar systems with M&#246;bius topology.







Abstract
Natural bond orbitals (NBOs) provide the familiar Lewis type (2c&#8211;2e&#8722;) localized description of a molecule. Interactions between nearly filled (2e&#8722; &#960; or &#963;) orbitals and empty (&#960;* or &#963;*) anti&#8208;bonding orbitals represent delocalization in the system and creates a framework to study stereoelectronic interactions. Here we show that deleting the interactions (NBODel) between &#960; and &#960;* orbitals in aromatic systems and acquiring the energy with the NBO program provides a highly intuitive and quantitative picture of &#960;&#8208;aromaticity that correlates with the well&#8208;established nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) method. This natural bond orbital resonance energy (NBO&#8208;RE) measures the vertical resonance energy (VRE) of aromatic systems without the use of an external reference structure. The NBO&#8208;RE method is applicable to the study of local aromaticity in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other non&#8208;planar systems.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards Pheromones by Cyanide&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Transformation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;Valerolactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two insect pheromones with &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety were accessed from a cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester. The key step is the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation yielding the &#948;&#8208;lactone unit.







Abstract
The cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;lactones with exocyclic ester moiety is the key transformation for the preparation of racemic 5&#8208;hexadecanolide (15&#8201;% over nine steps) and 6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide (22&#8201;% over eight steps), two insect pheromones. The benzyloxycarbonyl moiety is transformed via the acid chloride to the undecanoyl side chain. After reduction of the ketone to the secondary alcohol, this functional group was either reduced via the chloro compound to furnish the 5&#8208;hexadecanolide. On the other hand, stereoselective reduction of the ketone gave secondary alcohol with the wrong relative configuration, which was established by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure. Inversion was achieved by reaction of the methanesulfonate with cesium acetate yielding (R*,S*)&#8208;6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide with the relative configuration also present in the natural product.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ortho&#8208;Quinols are chiral 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives of interest to organic chemists because of their natural occurrence, their role as intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse natural products, and the versatility of their chemical reactivity. Readily accessible from dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenols or other arenols, ortho&#8208;quinols constitute useful molecular entities from which structural complexity can be rapidly built, as highlighted herein through many examples of targeted syntheses of natural products, such as trichodimerol.







Abstract
6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70&#8197;years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodebromination of Aryl Bromides with Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen source is reported. The application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology.







Abstract
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen sources is reported. Importantly, the application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology. The use of 6&#8208;phenyl substituted triazine&#8208;based PiprN5Pipr manganese pincer catalyst allows for the debromination of various aryl bromides with good yields. Notably, the process also occurs with bromides derived from several classes of natural products and bioactive compounds, such as citronellol, diacetone fructose, cholesterol, and vitamin E.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Pulvinic Acids Including Xerocomic Acid and Fluorescence Properties of Bis&#8208;lactone Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six pulvinic acids (pulvinic, pinastric, atromentic, xerocomic, isoxerocomic, variegatic) and a polyporic acid (atromentin) were synthesised. A set of terphenyl&#8208;quinones was prepared through sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings. Then, a rearrangement into pulvinic bis&#8208;lactones was induced by the action of Ac2O/DMSO. Ring openings and deprotections achieved total syntheses. Fluorescence properties of bis&#8208;lactones were determined.







Abstract
A set of representative pulvinic acids were synthesised using a bioinspired strategy. Terphenyl&#8208;quinones (polyporic acid scaffold) were prepared via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings allowing access to unsymmetrically substituted derivatives in a one&#8208;pot protocol. Subjected to the action of acetic anhydride and DMSO, quinones were converted into bis&#8208;lactone intermediates. Methanolysis and deprotection achieved the total syntheses of the corresponding pulvinic acids. Following this general strategy, symmetrical pulvinic, atromentic, variegatic acids and unsymmetrical congener pinastric, iso&#8208;pinastric, xerocomic and iso&#8208;xerocomic acids were prepared in fair yields. Fluorescence properties were observed for the bis&#8208;lactone intermediates and, as a complement to this synthetic work, optical properties were measured, and fluorescence quantum yields were determined for the bis&#8208;lactone pigments.

         <title>Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last few years, Katritzky salts emerged as a potential tool for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides. In this review, we summarized the applications of deaminative functionalization in the peptide chemistry field, including cross&#8208;coupling, photocatalysis, &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and macrocyclization. Moreover, findings confirmed the on&#8208;resin feasibility of using Katritzky salts in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptide drug discovery often benefits from the large structural diversity permitted by unnatural amino acids (UAAs). Indeed, numerous approved peptide drugs include UAAs in their sequences. Therefore, innovative chemical approaches either to synthesize UAAs or to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides are emerging themes in peptide drug discovery. Thanks to the recent advances in deaminative strategies using alkylpyridiniums salts, often referred to as Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed. In recent years the use of Katritzky salts have become popular in peptide chemistry due to their ease of preparation from a primary amine, which is a predominant functional group in amino acids. This review highlights the progress that has been made by using Katritzky salts in the synthesis of UAAs, late&#8208;stage peptide functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder/Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiophenols provides access to thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. To illuminate its mechanism, control experiments, NMR studies and DFT computations were conducted. In particular the arrangement of the diene and dienophile in the IEDDA step was investigated, as it determines the enantioselectivity of this method.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA)/thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions: Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions: two interactions of today's research in anion recognition supramolecular chemistry. The combination of these two interactions gives rise to interesting cooperativity effects that remain difficult to rationalize and quantify. In this Review, concepts of cooperativity are illustrated by reporting examples of combination of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Anion recognition represents an active area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing for a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This Review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.
