         <title>Direct Introduction of Perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) Groups into Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct addition of perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) groups to organic frameworks has seen a resurgence in interest due to the benefits of these groups in late&#8208;stage modification of pro&#8208;drugs and biologically active compounds, helping to identify new active leads. The presence of &#8208;CORF groups positively impacts the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds. In that sense, both polar methods and radical catalytic protocols have been developed for the direct syntheses of trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl ketones. In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late&#8208;stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl&#8208;substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8208;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8208;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table 1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proteus mirabilis is a pathogenic gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes several kinds of infections in human beings. Herein, we present the first total synthesis of the O&#8208;antigen tetrasaccharide repeating unit of P. mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) serogroup O75 with an aminoethyl linker appended at the reducing end. The tetrasaccharide comprising of D&#8208;glucosamine, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;galactose and D&#8208;galactosamine with a key (1 &#8594; 4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage between D&#8208;galactose and L&#8208;rhamnose was assembled by three step&#8208;wise [1+1+1+1], [1+2+1] and [2+2] assembly approaches and one one&#8208;pot [1+2+1] assembly. The respective routes provided the tetrasaccharide in yields of 23%, 18%, 20%, and 26% from suitably protected monosaccharide building blocks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A well&#8208;ordered strategy of sulfoxonium ylides as a directing group as well as carbene source for the Ru&#8208;catalysed [4+2] and Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] carbo&#8208;annulations with maleimides has been described. These novel methodologies have been successfully established for the synthesis of complex spiroindanones and benzoisoindoles containing compounds by the transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8208;H activation/functionalization reactions. Further, Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] annulated compounds were obtained in the absence of any oxidant.

         <title>I Bind It That Way &#8211; Bioorthogonal Unmasking of Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonally driven fluorogenic tagging scheme based on a novel design strategy is presented herein. The concept involving a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit as the trigger chemically caging a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor may address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red/NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.







Abstract
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies for the bioorthogonally controlled generation of pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone&#8208;methides are presented here. The novel concept relies on a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit that chemically cages a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor. On a synthetically readily accessible model compound we demonstrate that IEDDA reaction of the tetrazine with a TCO leads to the liberation of a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide, which is readily captured by nearby nucleophiles to form a fluorescent scaffold. Unlike in previous approaches to access bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenic probes, where the tetrazine unit acted as a quencher of fluorescence, the role of the tetrazine is redefined here. Such repurposed role of tetrazines is foreseen to address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red/NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.

         <dc:description>
An efficiently C&#8722;H alkoxylation of aromatic amides with primary alchols promoted by salicylaldehyde&#8208;cobalt catalysis under mild condition is detaild in this study. This protocol tolerates broad substrate scope including natural products.







Abstract
A simple and efficient salicylaldehyde&#8208;promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkoxylation of aromatic amides by employing primary alcohols as the coupling partner has been developed. This method utilizes a 8&#8208;aminoquinoline moiety as the directing group and successfully achieves the ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H alkoxylation in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This protocol features excellent functional tolerance and broad substrate scope including natural products. In addition, the directing group could be easily removed as well.

         <title>Chemoselective and Triggered Decomposition of Diazo Esters by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] Complex: En Route to Assisted Tandem Catalysis from Mixtures of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Start and stop: electron poor diazo compounds cannot give rise to carbene&#8208;mediated transformations at room temperature under [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] catalysis but their reactivity can be restored on demand by external stimuli (heat or addition of a Lewis acid).







Abstract
Decomposition of aryl and unsubstituted diazo ester into Rh(II)&#8208;carbenes by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex is shown to be slower than with Rh2(OAc)4. Diazo esters substituted by a second electron&#8208;withdrawing group do not suffer nitrogen extrusion when exposed for several hours to this (NHC)Rh(II) complex at room temperature. This chemoselective decomposition of diazo esters depending on their substituent (Ar, H, EWG) can furthermore be achieved on a mixture of substrates. The catalytic activity of [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] towards electron&#8208;poor diazo compounds is also restored by heating to reflux in chloroform, or after decomplexation of the NHC by addition of GaCl3. The [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex was then used to induce a fully selective reaction cascade from a mixture of two diazo esters. First, a donor/acceptor diazo compound was decomposed selectively at room temperature to give an intermolecular O&#8722;H insertion product without any decomposition of the electron poor diazo compound. Addition of GaGl3 then triggered nitrogen extrusion from the diazo malonate to give a 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;H insertion product. This transformation, where decomposition of diazo compounds catalyzed by Rh(II) complexes can be externally controlled, represents the first example of assisted tandem catalysis with two metal carbene precursors.

     alt="Chemoselective and Triggered Decomposition of Diazo Esters by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] Complex: En Route to Assisted Tandem Catalysis from Mixtures of Diazo Compounds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start and stop: electron poor diazo compounds cannot give rise to carbene-mediated transformations at room temperature under [(IMes)Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] catalysis but their reactivity can be restored on demand by external stimuli (heat or addition of a Lewis acid).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decomposition of aryl and unsubstituted diazo ester into Rh(II)-carbenes by the [(IMes)Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] complex is shown to be slower than with Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Diazo esters substituted by a second electron-withdrawing group do not suffer nitrogen extrusion when exposed for several hours to this (NHC)Rh(II) complex at room temperature. This chemoselective decomposition of diazo esters depending on their substituent (Ar, H, EWG) can furthermore be achieved on a mixture of substrates. The catalytic activity of [(IMes)Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] towards electron-poor diazo compounds is also restored by heating to reflux in chloroform, or after decomplexation of the NHC by addition of GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The [(IMes)Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] complex was then used to induce a fully selective reaction cascade from a mixture of two diazo esters. First, a donor/acceptor diazo compound was decomposed selectively at room temperature to give an intermolecular O&#8722;H insertion product without any decomposition of the electron poor diazo compound. Addition of GaGl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; then triggered nitrogen extrusion from the diazo malonate to give a 1,5-C&#8722;H insertion product. This transformation, where decomposition of diazo compounds catalyzed by Rh(II) complexes can be externally controlled, represents the first example of assisted tandem catalysis with two metal carbene precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron(&#921;&#921;&#921;) Catalyzed Aerobic C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; Cleavage of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under mild aerobic conditions is presented. The method constitutes a special case of the Mukaiyama hydration reaction, where the presence of a free hydroxyl group in the nearby carbon alters the fate of the reaction leading to the oxidative braking of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond. A broad selection of allylic alcohols has been examined and found to deliver useful for further functionalization products in good to excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies allowed us to propose a plausible pathway that may lead to the fragmentation products.







Abstract
The regiospecific C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under modified aerobic Mukaiyama hydration conditions is presented. The new methodology can be regarded as an equivalent of a two&#8208;step process, a typical hydration of the parent allylic alcohol followed by a 1,2&#8208;diol cleavage. A broad scope of substrates, both cyclic and acyclic, are applicable, thus introducing substantial structural modification to the core, especially of the former type of substrates. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction reveals the importance of the nearby hydroxyl group for the deviation from the typical Mukaiyama hydration pathway.

         <title>Synthesis of Lactones via Electrochemical Sequential Oxidative Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical lactone synthesis methodology has been developed, providing a rapid access to various dibenzopyranones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde, besides, 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid could also be transformed into corresponding dibenzopyranones in high efficiency. Various control experiments have been conducted to verify the mechanism of this electrochemical tandem oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we unveil a novel electrochemical oxidative strategy that facilitates the synthesis of lactones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acids. Crucially, our method allows for the convergent synthesis of lactones from the combinations of the respective 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid as starting material, owing to the oxidative process's compatibility within our electrochemical setup. This approach offers a robust and versatile pathway to construct various dibenzopyranones type lactone compounds through an environmentally considerate and economically advantageous process.

6&#8208;Aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines were obtained from N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids using persulfate salt as oxidant via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical relay. Mechanism study suggests involvement of photoredox and energy transfer pathways.







Abstract
A diverse array of 6&#8208;aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines was successfully synthesized using easily obtainable N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids, facilitated by photoredox catalysis. A mechanistic investigation revealed that this methodology might involve both photoredox and energy transfer catalytic cycles, generating acyl radicals that subsequently promote radical relay cyclization.

         <title>Functionalisation of Chromane by Deprotonative Metallation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two sets of conditions have been rationally optimised for the deprotometallation of chromane at the 4&#8208; or 8&#8208;position. Subsequent electrophilic trapping gave access to variously functionalised derivatives.







Abstract
Despite the biological interest in chromane derivatives, few studies dedicated to the functionalisation of this heterocycle have been reported. Herein, our objective is to demonstrate the potential of alkali metal bases for the introduction of substituents at its positions 4 and 8, and to explain the observed reactivity based on quantum chemical calculations. Guided by these theoretical results, preliminary optimisation was carried out on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran before applying the optimal conditions to chromane. Deprotolithiation at C8 was thus achieved using n&#8208;butyllithium in hexane at room temperature, while functionalisation at C4 was promoted by a 1:1 mixture of lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide and potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. Various electrophiles were used to intercept the lithiated intermediates, providing a convenient access to substituted chromane derivatives.

The first electricity&#8208;driven and metal&#8208;free C(3)&#8722;H fluoroalkoxylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with both various primary and secondary fluoroalkyl alcohols is developed.

The Guest Editors introduce Indo&#8208;German Workshops and summarize its conceptualization, purpose, and significance of scientific collaboration between India and Germany to address global scientific challenges.







Abstract
In recent years, the research collaboration between Indian and German scientists has flourished, underscored by a deep commitment to fostering collaboration in science across various domains between the two countries. Held since 2006, the Indo&#8208;German Chemistry Workshops have been a testament to this collaborative spirit. These workshops, organized by various hosts, have alternated between locations in India and Germany. The purpose of these workshops is to bring together scientists from different disciplines of chemical sciences and chemical engineering, and work on diverse emerging topics to form new alliances and joint publications, while preparing ground for new projects. They have been instrumental in breaking down disciplinary barriers and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations having the potential for groundbreaking innovations. This Guest Editorial introduces Indo&#8208;German Workshop series and their high&#8208;quality research output showcased as &#8220;Research consortia &amp; Institute Features: Indo&#8208;German Workshops (2011&#8211;2022)&#8221; &#8211; a joint special collection from the European Journal of Organic Chemistry (EurJOC), Chemistry&#8208;A European Journal (CEJ) and Chemistry&#8208;An Asian Journal (CAJ). This collection highlights important contributions to various domains of chemistry through research articles and reviews authored by faculty members from different institutes in India and Germany, who were past participants of these Indo&#8208;German workshops.

         <title>Hydrocyanation of Non&#8208;Activated Alkenes Without Handling HCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 34, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the works published in the last 20&#8197;years about the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated alkenes without using hydrogen cyanide gas have been compiled, paying special attention to all the different reaction mechanisms operating in each case.







Abstract
The hydrocyanation of alkenes can be considered a straightforward methodology that gives access to different functionalized organic chemistry entities. This is due to nitrile's high versatility, which can easily undergo further transformations. However, this process has traditionally employed hazardous hydrogen cyanide as the hydrocyanation agent. Therefore, in the last decades, different protocols have been developed to accomplish this key organic transformation without needing to handle HCN. In this review, we aim to gather the most recent works published in the last couple of decades regarding the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated olefins in the absence of gaseous hydrogen cyanide as nitrile source. In addition, special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanism working in each case.

         <title>Amide&#8208;Derived Norbornadienes: Towards Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Systems in Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of four NBD&#8208;derivatives based on amide substituents are reported. They show good properties as MOST systems and can operate under polar solvents such as alcohols. The photoisomerization and back&#8208;conversion catalyzed reaction are characterized.







Abstract
Solar energy harvesting is a promising alternative to the escalating energy demand. Among emerging technologies, MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems offer exciting avenues for solar fuel generation. However, their widespread application is partially hindered by the use of environmentally problematic and potentially hazardous organic non&#8208;polar solvents, such as toluene. Addressing this challenge, we here developed a series of four norbornadienes (NBDs) featuring symmetric amide substituents via functionalization of the readily available diacid substituted NBD. These compounds exhibit enhanced solubility in greener alcohol solvents (up to 0.1&#8197;M in EtOH), a significant advancement over non&#8208;polar NBDs. Moreover, computational characterization of the back&#8208;conversion reaction was performed by DFT calculations. The reversible switching was demonstrated for three new NBDs through photoisomerization via UV&#8208;light absorption to form QC, with quantum yields ranging from &lt;1 to 15&#8201;%. In addition, reversible catalysis was performed via a commercial heterogeneous gold&#8208;based catalyst.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Regioselective Selenohydroxylation of Enamine Amides with Diaryl Diselenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamide and diaryldiselenide under visible light irradiation, and develops an effective method for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selenide. Oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, avoiding the addition of environmentally unfriendly photocatalysts and oxidants.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of alpha&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;beta&#8208;seleno amides containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds by selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamine amides with diaryl diselenides under visible light irradiation. This protocol proceeds well to provide the 30 desired products with yields of 37&#8201;%&#8211;80&#8201;% using the 12&#8197;W blue LED as light source under room temperature conditions. Moreover, diaryl diselenides plays a dual role as a substrate and a photoactive reagent, as well as oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, thus avoiding the extra addition of environmentally unfriendly photoctalysts and oxidants.

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier&#8208;type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1&#8208;aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2&#8208;substitution (electron&#8208;withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1&#8208;aminoglycosides through this method.

         <dc:description>We present here the efficient preparation of 6&#8208;N&#8208;haloaryl&#8208;galactosides through a reductive amination process. A complete set of 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2;3,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;6&#8208;N&#8208;phenylamino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranosides were obtained with a straightforward method. The products were structurally analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques and NMR spectroscopic data. A complete investigation of the galactosyl derivatives is described, including an unexpected N,N&#180;&#8208;diphenylamino by&#8208;product. Moreover, relevant conformational aspects in solution and in the solid state are identified and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A direct visible&#8208;light mediated coupling of azaarenes with diversely functionalized alkyl carbons via organophotocatalytic sp3C&#8208;H bond activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted azaarenes are one of the most ubiquitous moieties in natural products and drug molecules. An efficient organophotocatalytic method for direct coupling of diverse cyclic and acyclic alkyl carbons of alcohols, ethers, alkyl halides and alkanes with different azaaryl systems has been developed. It uses low loading of easily synthesizable efficient acridinium based photocatalyst and blue LED to generate highly reactive radicals on saturated hydrocarbons through sequential single electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. These in situ generated nucleophilic carbon radicals then undergo instantaneous regio&#8208;selective coupling with azaarenes through Minisci type coupling to generate an array of important pharmacophores through sp2C&#8208;sp3C bond formation. With inexpensive organophotocatalysts, higher yield and wide substrate scope, this method provides a greener, efficient and versatile alternative to the previously reported syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Based pH&#8208;Responsive Configurational Molecular Rotary Switches Containing a New Conjugated &#960;&#8208;Electronic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocycle derived pH&#8208;activated, hydrazone based molecular switch and its switching mechanism are reported here. The introduction of a new conjugated p electronic framework (enone part in the molecule) allowed the system to undergo hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization , followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization through rotation around the partial C&#8208;N single bond. Under acidic pH, protonation took place selectively on pyrimidinone nitrogen, and that turned the molecule to the corresponding Z&#8208;H+ configuration. On the other hand, addition of triethylamine in the same solution reverted the molecule back to its original E&#8208;configuration. Extensive proton&#8208;NMR, and detailed X&#8208;ray crystallography coupled with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were carried out to establish the switching phenomena. Theoretical DFT calculations leading to free energy diagrams, transition states, and intermediates shed light on the mechanism behind the switching phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
FeCl3 catalyzes the isomerization of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (cis&#8208;THC analogues). The same catalyst promotes the formation of these products via cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl substrates and citral/farnesal&#8208;type aldehydes. The synthetic strategy could be applied to the racemic preparation of biologically relevant natural products cis&#8208;perrottetinene and &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabiorcol.







Abstract
Studies on a cycloisomerization reaction of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (reduced cis&#8208;THC analogues) are reported. The transformation is catalyzed by iron chloride and proceeds with the formation of two new bonds and two stereocenters diastereoselectively. The same catalyst also promotes the formation of these products via a one&#8208;pot tandem Knoevenagel condensation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones and citral or farnesal aldehydes, followed by cycloisomerization establishing a direct assembly of this important scaffold.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Threshold Analysis for Chemical Space Mapping of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mapping Ni&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling yields onto a plot of ligand buried volume and minimum electrostatic potential, we identified the area of monophosphine ligand space best suited for this reaction. Reported here is a generalizable workflow for identifying physicochemical descriptors that best classify the chemical space for a given reaction.







Abstract
A key challenge in synthetic chemistry is the selection of high&#8208;performing ligands for cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To address this challenge, this work presents a classification workflow to identify physicochemical descriptors that bin monophosphine ligands as active or inactive in Ni&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. Using five previously published high&#8208;throughput experimentation datasets for training, we found that a binary classifier using a phosphine's minimum buried volume and Boltzmann&#8208;averaged minimum electrostatic potential is most effective at distinguishing high and low&#8208;yielding ligands. Experimental validations are also presented. Using the two physicochemical descriptors from the binary classifier to represent the chemical space of monophosphine ligands leads to a more predictive guide for structure&#8208;reactivity relationships compared with classic chemical space representations.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Core&#8208;Modified Calixporphyrinoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structure, coordination, spectroscopic properties and applications of core&#8208;modified calix(n)phyrins that are resulted by replacing one or more pyrrole rings of calix(n)phyrins with different heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, phosphole, silole and so on and carbacycles such as m&#8208;/p&#8208;phenylene rings are described in this review.







Abstract
Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp2 and sp3 meso&#8208;carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as m/p&#8208;phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core&#8208;modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.

Additionally, we attempted the synthesis of triazole moiety&#8208;installed norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click reaction. We also demonstrated the removal of the protecting groups and the synthesis of free amino group&#8208;containing aryl azide&#8208; or triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs and peptides.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 7&#8208;imino&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazines starting from the corresponding polyfluorinated benzohydrazonoyl chlorides was accomplished. The method involves the formation of Blatter radicals and their subsequent C6,C7&#8208;regioselective interaction with aniline in the presence of MnO2.







Abstract
Derivatives of the first substituted 7&#8208;imino&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazines, namely 1&#8208;(2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoropyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,3&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;7&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and 1&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;3&#8208;(2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;6&#8208;amine, were unexpectedly isolated as the only products in yields of about 20&#8211;30&#8201;% after an attempt to obtain Blatter radicals from the corresponding amidrazones bearing polyfluorinated electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. All new compounds were fully characterized, and their molecular and crystal structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

     alt="Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of 1,3-Diaryl-7-imino-1,7-dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazines: Products of Unexpected Conversion of Polyfluorinated Blatter Radicals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-pot synthesis of 7-imino-1,7-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]triazines starting from the corresponding polyfluorinated benzohydrazonoyl chlorides was accomplished. The method involves the formation of Blatter radicals and their subsequent C6,C7-regioselective interaction with aniline in the presence of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives of the first substituted 7-imino-1,7-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]triazines, namely 1-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridin-4-yl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,3-diphenyl-7-(phenylimino)-1,7-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]triazin-6-amine and 1-(pentafluorophenyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl-7-(phenylimino)-3-(2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl)-1,7-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]triazin-6-amine, were unexpectedly isolated as the only products in yields of about 20&#8211;30&#8201;% after an attempt to obtain Blatter radicals from the corresponding amidrazones bearing polyfluorinated electron-withdrawing substituents. All new compounds were fully characterized, and their molecular and crystal structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Modification of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins through Cysteine: Recent Advances and Future Perspective</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as an efficient strategy to study and manipulate the physical and chemical properties and biological functionalities of proteins. Among the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine is one of the most frequently targeted residues for chemical modification of peptides and proteins due to its unique thiol group and its relatively low natural abundance. Cysteine is able to partake in radical and atom&#8208;, electron&#8208; and hydride&#8208;transfer reactions taking the benefit of redox activity of thiol side chain. Recently, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry have emerged as influential methodologies for enabling novel transformations in organic synthesis. These two fields both involve the generation of radical intermediates through single electron transfer processes, which align&#160; with the redox activity of cysteine residue. Furthermore, the mild and controllable features are suitable for solving the chemo&#8208; and regioselective problems of the existing bioconjugation strategies. Given the intrinsic benefits of photo&#8208; and electrochemisry, the application of developing novel cysteine&#8208;based bioconjugation methods is increasingly compelling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for modifying cysteine&#8208;containing peptides and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Vicinal Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Through Radical Addition/Remote (Hetero)Aryl Migration Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic molecules and constitute versatile building blocks. Remarkably, their radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization offers a valuable synthetic tool for rapidly accessing multifunctional compounds through a step and atom&#8208; economy process. More particularly, the addition of (hetero)aromatic groups onto alkenes is of particular appeal given the numerous applications of aromatic compounds in various fields. However, such process becomes difficult when attempted on simple non&#8208;conjugated aliphatic alkenes (unactivated alkenes). In this context, the (hetero)arylation of unactivated alkenes through the radical functionalization followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration has recently emerged as a powerful opportunity to address the lack of reactivity of such &#960; systems. The advances in radical chemistry have led to a flood of synthetic methods to trigger the addition of a carbon&#8208; or heteroatom&#8208;centered radical/(hetero)aryl migration sequence. Interestingly, the migration of the aromatic ring can take place from various atoms. This feature has spurred the design of several substrates allowing such a process to occur. This review intends to provide an overview of the contributions according to the type of substrates that have been employed. The reaction scope, limitations and mechanistic aspects will be discussed with the aim of stimulating efforts in this research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Ullmann Reaction of (Hetero)aryl/Vinyl Chlorides Enabled by Silylchloride&#8208;Activated Mn Powders</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;activation of Mn powers by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) enables a highly efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of (hetero)aryl/vinyl chlorides in DMA at room temperature to afford symmetrical biaryls/dienes in good to excellent yields although TMSCl plays a double&#8208;face role, activating Mn but deactivating Ni catalyst.







Abstract
A room temperature Ni&#8208;catalyzed Mn&#8208;mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre&#8208;activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between ortho&#8208;Cl and para&#8208;Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double&#8208;face role of TMSCl, i.&#8201;e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl&#8208;activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant.

&lt;p&gt;Pre-activation of Mn powers by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) enables a highly efficient Ni-catalyzed reductive homocoupling of (hetero)aryl/vinyl chlorides in DMA at room temperature to afford symmetrical biaryls/dienes in good to excellent yields although TMSCl plays a double-face role, activating Mn but deactivating Ni catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A room temperature Ni-catalyzed Mn-mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre-activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-Cl and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double-face role of TMSCl, i.&#8201;e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl-activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant. Applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in a multigram synthesis of Daclatasvir.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zonisamide, an important anti&#8208;epileptic drug, was prepared with a new and convenient synthesis. This process involves the preparation of a key hydroxyiminosultone intermediate, whose stereochemistry was characterized by powder XRD, and a rearrangement reaction, whose mechanism was investigated with a combination of techniques (NMR, HRMS and kinetic profiles).







Abstract
Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31&#8201;% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Helicenes from Centrally Chiral Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes from centrally chiral precursors via central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chiral conversion or transfer strategies. It covers a broad spectrum of reactions, including Fischer indolization, Povarov reaction, Michael reaction, [3+2] and [2+2+2] cycloadditions, showcasing the versatility of these approaches in constructing enantioenriched helicenes.







Abstract
Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis. In this review article, described between 2012 and 2024, the approaches for the synthesis of chiral helicenes by chirality conversion or transfer from centrally chiral precursors are summarized.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Time&#8208;Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance for Direct Visualizing Mechanisms in Radical Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical chemistry is an important research field that plays a vital role in life science, material science, and energy conversions. However, directly visualizing the transient open&#8208;shell intermediates unambiguously in radical chemistry is a significant and long&#8208;standing challenge. Recently, we have developed an innovative ultrawide single&#8208;sideband phase&#8208;sensitive detection (U&#8208;PSD) time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) technique, which enables the characterization of diverse transient radical intermediates and mechanistic studies close to reaction conditions. In this brief review, we will offer an outline of the principles underlying our U&#8208;PSD TREPR technique, and present examples highlighting the technique's ability to accurately characterize and track free radical intermediates in photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Lactams: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched seven&#8208;membered lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of biologically active compounds and drugs. Significant progress has been achieved in this domain more recently. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral seven&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

         <title>Disrupting Substance Use Disorder: The Chemistry of Iboga Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iboga alkaloid class of monoterpene indole alkaloids have long inspired synthetic chemists in their structural complexity and dense functionalization. Their unique anti&#8208;addictive properties have propelled this class of natural products into potential lead compounds for drug discovery efforts as well. This present review covers the synthetic strategies and tactics used in their synthesis over the last 70&#8197;years.







Abstract
The iboga alkaloids are a family of monoterpene indole alkaloids first discovered from the root of Tabernanthe iboga. The major alkaloid constituent in the root, ibogaine, has garnered interest for its anti&#8208;addictive properties. Ibogaine has been shown to reduce opiate, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine self&#8208;administration in rodents. However, ibogaine itself is less than optimal as a treatment in humans for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD) due to its cardiotoxicity and hallucinogenic potential. Instead, ibogaine is an attractive lead for drug discovery efforts. Indeed, several notable programs have been launched to both elucidate ibogaine's mechanism of action and reduce its toxicity. While there have been over 20 total syntheses of ibogamine, ibogaine, and closely related family members, there are far fewer syntheses of recently isolated iboga alkaloids. In this targeted review, we discuss the synthetic strategies applied to the synthesis of classical and non&#8208;classical iboga alkaloids.

         <title>Conformational and Electron Density Analysis of Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes: All Roads Lead to Boats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes has been studied through mapping potential energy surface analysis employing DFT computational methods. Also, the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms on the conformational equilibrium have been analyzed employing the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. Finally, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) approach pinpoints key atoms in the conformer stability.







Abstract
In view of the existence of an optimal conformation for molecular recognition and bearing in mind that nucleosides exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical properties, whereby their conformation has a key role in molecular recognition, the tendency of the pseudosugar moiety in carbanucleosides to adopt a boat&#8208;like conformation has been studied on the basis of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane system, resulting in versatile drug&#8208;like scaffolds to increase molecular recognition. It is already known that using this system as pseudosugar can fix the conformation in the Northern or Southern geometry, required for biological activity, according to the relative position of the three&#8208;member cycle. By mapping their energy potential surface, we investigate the preference for boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. DFT is utilized alongside NBO analysis to explore the enhanced stability of boat&#8208;like conformers, also considering the influence of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms. Additionally, charge density distribution analysis using QTAIM identifie key atoms contributing to stability changes. These findings will help to comprehend this behavior in the drug discovery process when conformationally restricted nucleosides are involved.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Resolution of Functionalized Oxacalix[4]arenes with Planar Chirality via Dynamic SNAr Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of racemic oxacalix[4]arenes exhibiting planar chirality and a mesomer with a symmetric plane were conveniently synthesized and separated via dynamic SNAr reaction in 20&#8201;% and 49&#8201;% yields, respectively. The racemic mixture could be further resolved using HPLC on a chiral column. The products interconverted in the presence of CsF as a catalyst.







Abstract
A pair of racemic oxacalix[4]arenes featuring planar chirality and a mesomer with a symmetric plane were conveniently synthesized under mild conditions via a one&#8208;pot dynamic SNAr reaction and separated in 20&#8201;% and 49&#8201;% yields, respectively. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses confirmed their structures unambiguously. The racemic mixture could further be resolved using HPLC on a chiral column. Time&#8208;dependent products distribution and interconversion between products with CsF as a catalyst were revealed by 1H NMR studies, convincing the dynamic nature of SNAr reaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review are discussed one&#8208;pot domino/cascade/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for poly azacycles synthesis. Those are fused, bridged or spiranic depending on the position of the nucleophile. The mechanism of the two steps together with the stereochemical outcomes are detailed.







Abstract
Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.

         <title>Halogenated adenine and adenosine natural products in Streptomyces sp. JCM9888</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascamycin 1 and dealanylascamycin 2 are adenosine containing nucleoside antibiotics carrying the rare 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl ribose motif and a chlorine atom attached to C2 of the adenine ring. Gene knockouts (&#916;acmK and &#916;acmJ) in the producing strain, Streptomyces sp. JCM9888, generated mutants that were disabled in the assembly of the sulfamoyl moiety. This resulted in the production of 2&#8208;chloroadenosine 3 and 2&#8208;chloroadenine 4, indicating that purine halogenation can occur independently of sulfamoylation. Incubations in media enriched in bromide content resulted also in the identification of 2&#8208;bromoadenine 5, 2&#8208;bromoadenosine 6 and 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;bromoadenosine 7.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Electrochemical Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes with 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine scaffolds are present in biological and pharmaceutical molecules. However, achieving asymmetric functionalization of acridines remains challenging without an efficient and highly stereoselective approach. Here we demonstrate a facile electrooxidative asymmetric dehydrogenative coupling reaction of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes. This method offers a sustainable and effective route to various chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylation of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities facilitated by readily available aminocatalyst. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetric analyses reveal that this asymmetric electrochemical reaction proceeds through redox&#8208;mediated oxidation, followed by a nucleophilic attack with concurrently generated enamine. We anticipate that our research will open avenues for promising exploration in organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective transformations.</dc:description>

The scope of (hetero)arylating reagents includes indoles, pyrroles, furan, N, N&#8208;dimethylanilines, and electron&#8208;rich benzenes. The applicability of this protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale experiment and the derivatization of the target products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with

Enolizable 5&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversely substituted dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates react under mild conditions, at ambient temperature in the presence of catalytic scandium triflate, with enolizable 5&#8208;meracaptotetrazoles. Most commonly, this yields the corresponding 1:1 adducts via insertion of the S&#8208;atom into the strained C,C bond, leading to ring&#8208;opening. Control experiments performed with dimethyl 2&#8208;phenylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate and 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole demonstrated that the initial product of the reaction is the corresponding sulfane, formed via S&#8208;insertion. However, thermal rearrangement performed at 60 &#176;C led to the formation of the isomeric N&#8208;insertion product. This rearrangement is accelerated by electron&#8208;donating substituents present at the para&#8208;position of the arene. In contrast, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents prevent this rearrangement at room temperature, and in these examples the S&#8208;insertion products were formed exclusively.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Syntheses of Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The obtention of triarylmethanes was first evaluated in the presence of various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids under the same stoichiometric conditions. An efficient silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of triarylmethanes is reported. The reaction offers low catalyst loadings and quasi stoichiometric conditions (1&#8208;1.2 equiv. of electrophile) to access to symmetric and unsymmetric TRAMs in moderate to excellent yields (35 examples). A broad scope of substrates is observed, with a chemotolerance to ester and cyano groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Mechanofluorochromic Molecules and Their Differential Mechanochromic Effects Triggered by Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the influence of nitrogen atoms on the mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties, three novel anthracene&#8208;based MFC compounds were designed and synthesized, and the effects of nitrogen atom position changes on their photophysical properties and MFC properties were deeply explored. The structure of the three compounds maintains the anthracene and enone portions unchanged, with only subtle adjustments made to the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine moiety. Experimental verification revealed that these three anthracene&#8208;based compounds exhibit almost identical photophysical properties in solution but display significantly different fluorescence colors and distinct MFC properties in the solid state. The findings of this study not only offer a new perspective for understanding the MFC mechanism of anthracene&#8208;based compounds but also provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel MFC molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>NaBH4&#8208;Induced Chemoselective Mechanochemical Neat Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Active Dihydrofuran/&#1013;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters and Synthetic Application to Isoindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have established NaBH4&#8208;induced very short and efficient green (E&#8208;factor=0.40) chemoselective synthetic route of bioactive fused dihydrofuran and silica gel controlled &#1013;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters under solvent&#8208;free grindstone chemistry. Synthetic application of &#1013;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters to isoindoles and antileishmania investigation of alcohol/dihydrofuran derivatives are another footprint of our developed protocol.







Abstract
The synthesis of small heterocycles under neat mechanochemical conditions is of great interest in the field of drug design because most of the commercially available drugs contain at least one heterocyclic unit. The sodium borohydride (NaBH4) promoted reductive cyclization to fused dihydrofuran under grinding technique is one of the compendium additions for the clean future. The development of chemoselective reduction under silica&#8208;gel supported conditions represents significant progress in organic synthesis, offering a versatile and efficient method for selective reduction of specific functional groups within complex molecules. Synthesis of isoindole derivatives from the chemoselective reduce product via a sustainable short synthetic pathway is another significant process of our newly developed protocol. Finally, antileishmanial investigations of our synthesized compounds establish a soft bridge between biology and chemistry.

Abstract
A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;position, as Michael acceptors.

         <title>A Concise Ring Closing Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Preparation of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constrained C4&#8208;functionalized dipeptide derivatives incorporating a proline moiety were prepared in high yields by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) reaction. Post&#8208;functionalization studies of the newly introduced diene system pave the way for future applications in peptide synthesis, medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Herein we report the preparation of C4&#8208;functionalized proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane (Aba) amino acids by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis reaction of readily accessible dipeptide precursors. The reverse&#8208;turn inducing properties of the newly synthesized constrained dipeptide mimics were assessed by computational studies. Furthermore, the desired Aba derivatives, carrying a synthetically versatile diene moiety, were subjected to post&#8208;functionalization reactions to validate their potential application in peptide/peptidomimetic chemistry and drug discovery.

         <title>Stable and Reusable Pd/Cu Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Synthesis of Hydroxy Isoindolones by Domino C&#8722;H Activation and Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binaphthyl&#8208;stabilized palladium&#8211;copper bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu&#8208;BNP) catalyzed the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones derivatives by domino C&#8722;H activation followed by C&#8722;N bond formation. The catalyst was recovered and reused for four successive cycles without any appreciable change in particle size. One of the substrates was used to synthesize a BRD4 inhibitor.







Abstract
A domino C&#8722;H activation and annulation process catalyzed by stable and reusable bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu&#8208;binapthyl nanoparticles) was developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones. The scope of the reaction was examined utilizing a variety of N&#8208;alkoxy benzamide/benzothioamide derivatives and benzaldehydes, which yielded moderate to good yields of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones, one of which was used to synthesize a BRD4 inhibitor. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis is also reported. The Pd/Cu&#8208;binapthyl nanocatalyst has been recovered and reused up to four times without any major change in particle size and reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;A domino C&#8722;H activation and annulation process catalyzed by stable and reusable bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu-binapthyl nanoparticles) was developed for the synthesis of 3-hydroxyisoindolin-1-ones/thiones. The scope of the reaction was examined utilizing a variety of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxy benzamide/benzothioamide derivatives and benzaldehydes, which yielded moderate to good yields of 3-hydroxyisoindolin-1-ones/thiones, one of which was used to synthesize a BRD4 inhibitor. A gram-scale synthesis is also reported. The Pd/Cu-binapthyl nanocatalyst has been recovered and reused up to four times without any major change in particle size and reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydrogenative N&#8722;N Coupling and Facile Synthesis of Cobalt Complexes Supported by Tetrazene Based Ligand: Synthesis of Quinolines and Quinazolinones via Activation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the unprecedented synthesis of tetrazene&#8208;based cobalt complexes using unusual coupling of amines via dehydrogenation. These cobalt complexes were employed for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles (quinoline, and quinazolinone). The mechanistic investigation involved conducting control experiments and identifying intermediates through IR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein we first report the unprecedented synthesis of tetrazene&#8208;based cobalt complexes using unusual coupling of amines via dehydrogenation. These cobalt complexes were employed for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles (quinoline, and quinazolinone). Based on control experiments and IR identification of intermediates, we proposed a plausible reaction mechanism. Synthesis protocols were utilized for preparative scale synthesis and biologically active molecule (&#177;)&#8208;galipinine synthesis.

         <title>Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution of Unprotected Amino Acids Using Ni(II) Chiral Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic thermodynamic resolution of racemic unprotected amino acids with the Ni(II) chiral Schiff base complex are described. This method can be easily applied to a variety of unprotected amino acids to obtain optical pure amino acids and the side chain modified amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Dynamic thermodynamic resolution of amino acids (AAs) using Ni(II) chiral Schiff bases is one of the simplest and most efficient methods to obtain optically active AAs. A comparison of the reactivity of 36 rac&#8208;AAs with the Ni(II) complex revealed that this method can be easily applied to dynamic thermodynamic resolution and S/R interconversion of AAs with unprotected active functional groups. It can also be really applied for the side&#8208;chain modification of AA derivatives with active functional groups on the Ni(II) complex. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of the synthesized Ni(II) complexes were evaluated, and the Ni(II) complexes [(S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;g, (S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;h, and (S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;i] showed remarkable antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, a Gram positive bacterium.

         <title>Regioselective Halogenation of 2&#8208;Oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Using Oxone&#8208;Halide With or Without Aryl Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly and regioselective halogenation protocols, especially green fluorination protocols of 2&#8208;oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;keto esters are developed by manipulation of the components of the oxone&#8208;halide&#8208;aryl iodine system.







Abstract
Efficient and environmentally benign regioselective halogenation protocols have been achieved through the mediation of oxone&#8208;halide, with or without the assistance of aryl iodine. The key to the success of the regioselectivity process is the controlled generation of the active [X]+ or halogen&#8208;substituted hypervalent iodine (III) by manipulating the components of the oxone&#8208;halide&#8208;aryl iodine system.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the chemo&#8208;selective synthesis of the pyrazole and its derivatives from acetopheneones. The selectivity of the reaction can easily be tuned by shifting reaction from acidic to basic medium for the synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;pyrirmidines and pyrazolo&#8208;pyridines respectively.







Abstract
Pyrazoles and pyrazolo fused pyrimidines and pyridines are well known for their applications in various fields like pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials sciences. Keeping this in mind herein, we have developed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the chemo&#8208;selective synthesis of the pyrazole and its derivatives from acetopheneones. The selectivity of the reaction can easily be tuned by shifting reaction from acidic to basic medium for the synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;pyrirmidines and pyrazolo&#8208;pyridines respectively. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance in the form of &#8722;F, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OMe, and &#8722;B(OH)2 in good yields.

         <title>Construction of Multiple Five&#8208;Membered Rings in Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene Core for the&#160;Synthesis of&#160;a Nona&#8208;cycle Buckybowl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, commonly referred to as &#8220;buckybowls&#8221;, are provocative compounds, and their inviting functions based on the non&#8208;planar pi&#8208;conjugation are expected. Yet, achieving synthesis of some kinds of the curved structure remaining challenging. Herein we report skeletal construction of a nonacyclic buckybowl that is synthetically unachievable heretofore, namely, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene. The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible process in which a multiple substituted dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is amenable to threefold formation of five&#8208;membered rings at its periphery. The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution&#8208;phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.</dc:description>

The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution-phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preferential Binding to a Mannoside of a&#160; Pyridine&#8211;Acetylene&#8211;Phenol Macrocycle&#160;with a Fluorine Substituent in the Cavity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol macrocycle in which a fluorine atom was introduced in place of a hydroxy group, as a host for the selective binding to epimers of glucose. The fluorine atom was expected to work as a negatively charged infill repelling oxygen atoms of saccharides andprevent the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside, whose cross&#8208;section size is larger than those of the corresponding epimers, especially of a mannoside. UV&#8722;Vis and fluorescence titration experiments revealed that this host showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside. 1H NMR and molecular modeling suggested that the fluorine atom acts as a moderate infill weakening the binding to a glucoside.This result indicates that selectivity for guest molecules can be modified by replacing a hydroxy group and a hydrogen atom in host molecules with a fluorine atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes and Other Unsaturated Systems: A Literature Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization provides easy access to carbocycles and heterocycles in a single operation with complete atom economy. In recent years, nickel catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing fused arenes and heteroarenes with high regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. This review highlights the historical perspective and advances made in recent years in nickel&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions of alkynes, diynes, and various unsaturated systems. The catalytic activity of the nickel complexes, such as Ni&#8208;phosphine, Ni&#8208;NHC, Ni&#8208;pincer, Ni&#8208;diimine, etc, and their mechanistic insights have been thoroughly examined. Highly substituted arenes have broad applications in pharmaceuticals and soft materials. The applications of cyclotrimerization in these areas have been illustrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation Reactions of Acetylene: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simplest alkyne, acetylene, is a suitable C2 linker synthon that enables the connection of organic molecules with different functional groups. However, reactions of acetylene with advanced organic building blocks are much less explored compared to substituted alkynes. In this article, we present a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation reaction with acetylene, CO, amines, and perfluoroalkyl halides that enables the preparation of various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides in one step. This protocol also provides a new strategy for the late modification of bioactive molecules, as demonstrated by the construction of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl ibrutinib derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Examining 1,4,2&#8208;Dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;one as an Alternative Reagent to Acyl Azides in the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;one as an alternative reagent to acyl azides in the Staudinger reaction, providing a safe and efficient method for synthesizing N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes under metal&#8208;free conditions. This approach involves a heat&#8208;promoted nucleophilic attack of phosphines on 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, followed by the extrusion of CO2 gas, resulting in the formation of the P&#8722;N coupling product. The synthetic utility of this metal&#8208;free imidization of phosphine was demonstrated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and its suitability for subsequent transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the overall reaction pathway leading to the formation of N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Transformations of Enamines: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enamines, containing nucleophilic amino groups and activated C=C bonds, are important building blocks, and widely used in the synthesis of heterocycles, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. In recent years, electrosynthesis has gradually developed into a powerful protocol for constructing chemical bonds due to its high economy, environmental friendliness, and mild reaction conditions. This review summarized the recent advances in the electrochemical transformation of enamines, including the construction of heterocyclic compounds, C(sp2)&#8208;H bond functionalization of enamines for synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes&#65292;and the functionalization reactions of enamines via C=C double bond cleavage. The reaction conditions and mechanisms were systematically discussed, and the challenges and future directions of this field were included in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Selective Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions of Aryl C&#8211;H Bonds with Carboxylic Acids at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids is developed. This acetoxylation protocol is performed under room temperature using N&#8208;&#64258;uorobenzene&#8208;sulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, exhibiting a wide range of functional group tolerance and affording &#948;&#8208;position&#8208; selective products up to 85% yield. Notably, a diverse set of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs is also found to be compatible under the current reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction presumably proceeds through a seven&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) Applied to the Synthesis of API Impurities: A Case Study in Oxidative Decarboxylation of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) has dramatically impacted experimental reaction development by enabling the rapid exploration of a diverse set of reaction conditions. During the past few decades, HTE has evolved as a tool to expedite reaction discovery and optimization. This work details the application of HTE to synthesize impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ketone/aldehyde functionality, specially focusing on ibuprofen impurity E. Initial experiments using K2S2O8 as oxidant yielded moderate results. Subsequent HTE screens identified cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 as new effective decarboxylative oxidants, with RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) achieving the highest yield of 65%. This optimized method was successfully applied to synthesize ibuprofen impurity E on a gram scale. Additionally, the applicability of these methods to obtain other API related substances, such as naproxen impurity L and ketoprofen impurity A, was demonstrated. This research highlights the potential of HTE to streamline the synthesis of API impurities, making them widely accessible for pharmaceutical development purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Varying the Electronics on Isothiourea Catalysts: Basicity, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral and achiral substituted isothiourea catalysts were synthesized and employed in model silylation reactions to understand how changing the electronics on the catalyst core affected intermolecular interactions between catalyst intermediates and substrates, ultimately affecting selectivity and rate. Five different chiral catalysts were utilized in a silylation&#8208;based kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;(para substituted)phenylcyclohexanols and the rate of silylation of these same alcohols was investigated with three different achiral catalysts. Linear free energy relationships were examined, highlighting that rate and selectivity were highly dependent on the electronics of the catalyst and the substrate, and that both affected the intermolecular interactions that resulted.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8208;S, C&#8208;Se Bond Formation via Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three&#8208;component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8208;S and C&#8208;Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8208;S/S&#8208;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco&#8208;friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three&#8208;membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring&#8208;opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.</dc:description>

This review will disscuss decade developments, including C-S and C-Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C-S/S-Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco-friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three-membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring-opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal-catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Macrocyclization for the Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes: Recent Updates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The planar chirality of macrocycles is a fascinating research topic. Locking the configurational flip between the benzene ring and macrocycle leads to planar chirality, which can significantly enhance the biological activity of cyclophanes. Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes are widely used in pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and functional materials. However, accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes via asymmetric catalysis has remained challenging. Among the various strategies, asymmetric macrocyclization provides a powerful tool for accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes. This method allows for control of the planar chirality when constructing the macrocycle and greatly improves the efficiency. There are three types of macrocyclization reactions: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. In addition, the chiral confinement strategy breaks through conservative synthetic approaches. This review summarizes these achievements, aiming to highlight the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclophanes and inspire interested researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;Diarylphenazines as Tailored Organophotoredox Catalysts for the Reductive Activation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A small library of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines, N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines has been synthesized as strongly reducing organophotocatalysts without the need for sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and their suitability as organophotoredox catalysts for the efficient activation of olefins was investigated using the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The findings were supported by DFT calculations. Three photocatalysts were identified that allowed quantitative yields with 10 mol% catalyst loading and 20 h irradiation by a 365 nm LED. The catalyst loading was gradually reduced to 0.5 mol% and the irradiation time was reduced to only 20 min. These experiments revealed that N,N&#8208;diisobutyl&#8208;4'&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;amine is the most efficient photocatalyst among the N&#8208;arylphenothiazines. This chromophore combines high electron density introduced by the diisobutylamino phenyl group with high absorptivity at 365 nm caused by the phenylene bridge to the phenothiazine core. In an attempt to shift the excitation wavelength into the visible light range for selectivity and sustainability purposes (potential use of sunlight as a light source), N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines were designed that exhibit a red&#8208;shifted and broad absorbance shoulder into the visible range, but only N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines allow photocatalysis and the one&#8208;electron activation of alkenes by visible light (450 nm LED).</dc:description>

         <title>Denitrative Functionalization of Nitroarenes: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroarenes are fundamental feedstocks in the chemical industry. Their relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond allows for late&#8208;stage modifications of molecules and exhibits complete orthogonality to the reactivity of C&#8722;halogen bond in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes holds significant appeal due to it avoids the use of aryl halides, thereby simplifying reaction steps and improving atom and step economy. Recent progress in direct denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes includes palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, copper&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, as well as metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot C&#8722;NO2 functionalization. In this review, we provide a concise overview of these advancements, detailing the reaction features and mechanisms. This summary aims to highlight the versatility and efficiency of denitrative functionalization methodologies, offering insights into their potential applications and inspiring further research in this promising area of organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <title>Electroreduction Reactions Mediated by Organic Molecules: Recent Advances and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction is an important aspect of organic electrochemistry. Its chemistry does not require the addition of additional reductants, making it an effective alternative to various traditional reduction reactions. Among them, organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction is recognized as a promising approach. Organo&#8208;mediators can be reduced directly at the cathode to form reactive radical anions that subsequently reduce the substrate via electron transfer (ET) to initiate the reaction being investigated. Organo&#8208;mediators typically have a more positive reduction potential, and their role in the whole reaction is similar to that of catalysts. Their addition transforms the ET process from the original heterogeneous process into a homogeneous one. Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction can effectively avoid the over&#8208;electrolysis of the substrate and the product at the electrode and the intolerance of sensitive substrates or functional groups during electrolysis, thereby preventing the occurrence of side reactions. It can also prevent the excessive consumption of reagents and electrical energy while promoting the reaction to achieve higher or completely different selectivity. Considering the advantages of this type of reaction, this review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver/Segphos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyrrolidine Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of chiral heterocyclic derivatives is an important and challenging topic in the field of synthetic chemistry. In this work, a silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of glycine iminoesters with 3&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles was developed. The DTBM&#8208;Segphos&#8208;induced spirooxindole cycloaddition reaction was used to synthesize a range of stereodivergent alkyl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee), good diastereoselectivities (up to 20:1 dr), and high yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational insights from DFT calculations indicate that the Michael addition step is crucial in determining the reaction rate and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethyl Mesoxalate, A Representative Tricarbonyl Compound &#8211; A Useful Synthetic Tool Possessing Diverse Reactivities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diethyl mesoxalate, a vicinal tricarbonyl compound, possesses multiple functionalities that facilitate diverse chemical conversions. The central carbonyl group with two ester functionalities exhibits high electrophilicity to accept nucleophilic attacks of various reagents. This unusual electrophilicity enables the reaction with acid amides that are not common nucleophiles in organic syntheses. Condensation with active methylene compounds or amines leads to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and imines, respectively, which can be transformed into more complex polyfunctionalized compounds by a second nucleophilic addition. Chemical transformations between the central and adjacent ester carbonyls furnish new ring systems that are useful in material and pharmaceutical sciences. The central carbonyl group can also be built into a ring system by reacting with reagents possessing nucleophilic and electrophilic sites. Furthermore, the central carbonyl serves as a dienophile that undergoes cycloaddition to form functionalized heterocyclic compounds in a single step.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselectively arylated heteroarenes are privileged scaffolds with remarkable biological and optoelectronic properties. Traditional arylation approaches based on the transition&#8208;metal catalysis present various issues related to the cost of synthesis and environmental sustainability. The growing applications of arylheteroarenes in pharmaceuticals and cutting&#8208;edge technologies have fuelled interest in the development of green and cost&#8208;effective synthetic approaches. This article reports the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8208;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes.

         <title>PHOTOINDUCED INTRAMOLECULAR C&#8211;N COUPLING FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF AZOLO[1,2,4]BENZOTHIADIAZINES DERIVATIVES</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This paper explores an original synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds derived from photoinduced intramolecular coupling reactions, involving the formation of C&#8208;N and C&#8208;C bonds. Specifically, two classes of compounds were targeted: 4H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaacephenanthrylenes. The synthetic strategy involved nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare key sulfonamide starting substrates, followed by photoinduced cyclization (via the Substitution Radical Nucleophilic Unimolecular, SRN1) under mild conditions using visible light. The scope of the reaction was explored with different substituent groups on the starting materials, which demonstrated moderate to very good product yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78%. Moreover, this strategy represents the first synthetic approach to obtain 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaphenanthrylenes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalysis has been developed for the synthesis of indanone using low&#8208;energy green light as input energy. This methodology provides a greener avenue to construct indanone through a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acid and internal alkyne.







Abstract
Low&#8208;energy light, endowing with excellent characteristics of lower energy, fewer side reactions, more abundance in solar light. The scenario has been developed for the fabrication of indenone through a low&#8208;energy green light driven radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acids and internal alkynes using Rhodamine 6G as photocatalyst. Various kinds of substrates are suitable for this methodology, affording the corresponding indenones in a greener and efficient manner.

         <title>Non&#8208;Reductive CO2 Valorization into Oxazolidinones via Cycloaddition to Aziridines: A Personal Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides an overview of recent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies published on the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to form oxazolidinones, with a particular attention to the employed experimental conditions, which are essential parameters for envisioning real costs and possible applications of these synthetic processes.







Abstract
This perspective discusses bibliography data that has been published since 2018 on the synthesis of oxazolidinones by reacting corresponding aziridines with CO2. The versatility and viability of various procedures have been analyzed by considering the variety of tested substrates as well as experimental conditions and catalytic systems used. Collected data highlights that the reaction can be effectively promoted by several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems that have been optimized in order to conjugate the process sustainability and productivity with convenient procedural costs.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Allylic Addition to Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In comparison with the well&#8208;established allylic additions to C=O, C=N, and C=C double bonds, the dearomative allylic addition to arene &#960;&#8208;systems is heavily underdeveloped due to the severe challenge in breaking aromatic resonance stabilization. Herein, we disclose a general and efficient dearomative allylic addition to chromium&#8208;bound arenes using allylsilanes as the pronucleophiles, thus affording convenient access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. With commercially available deuterium sources, the versatility of this strategy further enables an arene dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuteroallylation with a high level of deuterium incorporation. Finally, a preliminary try on the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation based on a chiral auxiliary strategy is described.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8722;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

         <dc:description>Intramolecular photochemical C&#8211;H insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. While there are limitations in the scope of C&#8211;H bonds amenable to C&#8211;H insertion under photochemical conditions relative to metal catalysed C&#8211;H insertions, the benefits of conducting these synthetically powerful transformations in a metal&#8208;free approach offers &#8220;green&#8221; advantages. Recent advances in technology have revolutionised the potential for use of photochemical transformations in synthesis, including the wavelength control enabled by LEDs and the benefits associated with continuous flow processing which overcome many of the traditional challenges associated with synthetic photochemistry including scale&#8208;up. The potential for telescoping the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds and downstream photochemical reactions is clear. This review summarises the development of intramolecular photochemical C&#8211;H insertions and highlights the benefits of recent technological advances.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Iodonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides by DMSO</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium salt mediated methodology activating sulfur atom, promoting the conversion of sulfides into sulfoxides exploiting DMSO as the sole oxidant. An easy access to pharmaceutical active compounds such as Sulforaphane and Modafinil.







Abstract
Compounds bearing the sulfoxide moiety display an important class of molecules in pharmaceutical industry. Many efforts have been made towards the development of novel, sustainable, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute and industrially friendly processes. A novel iodonium&#8208;salt&#8208;mediated oxidation protocol for the conversion of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides is reported, employing DMSO as the oxidant. Several sulfides decorated with various functional groups were tested, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields with remarkable chemoselectivity. The oxidation protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) Sulforaphane and Modafinil.

         <title>Difluorocarbene Enables Modular Synthesis of Difluoroalkylated Bicyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the modular synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes has been developed. As shown above, this protocol involves a stepwise procedure and features synthetic simplicity and structural diversity without tedious synthesis of difluoroalkylating reagents.







Abstract
A straightforward method for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes (BCPs) from [1.1.1]propellane (TCP) through a stepwise procedure has been developed. This process involves nucleophilic addition of organozinc or ArMgBr reagents to TCP, followed by reaction with difluorocarbene to generate BCP substituted difluoroalkylzinc species, which subsequently couple with electrophiles, including allyl/propargyl bromides, (hetero)aryl disulfides, and proton, to provide a wide range of difluoroalkylated BCPs that otherwise are difficult to access through conventional methods. The transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility of this modular synthesis.

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.

         <title>Heavy Atom Quantum Tunnelling in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Pentalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy atom quantum tunnelling was already observed in several &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting reactions of antiaromatic molecules. In these, their Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create sharp energy profiles with small atomic trajectories, which are ideal for observing tunnelling. Herein, we studied the effect of the nitrogen in the N&#8208;heterocyclic pentalenes, distinguishing between isothermic and exothermic reactions. The reactivity was not easily predictable, with our computations revealing a wide variability of rates, from the complete cancellation of the barrier to a high isomer stability. For all these systems, quantum tunnelling emerged as the most significant mechanism at room temperature and the only valid one at cryogenic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Multi&#8208;Functionalized Organogermaniums: Diastereoselective Transformations of Germacycles Derived from Cheletropic Reactions of Boron&#8208;Substituted Butadienes with Ge(II) Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of organogermanium in chemistry has recently attracted attention. Thanks to the inherent features of germanium (Ge), introducing Ge&#8208;based substituents into organic frameworks has enhanced bioactivity and optoelectronic properties of molecules. Herein, the synthesis of multi&#8208;functionalized organogermaniums using Ge(II) salts is reported. The germacycles having an allylboron moiety, which is derived from the (4+1) cycloadditions of the butadienes bearing a boronic ester moiety with Ge(II) salts, can be applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enable access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Porous Organic Polymers (FPPOPs)&#8208;Promoted Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel catalyst systems, especially as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Si&#8208;C bond &#8208;forming arylation reaction of hydrosilanes is highly desirable. Herein, we developed a simple and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for construction of functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (FPPOPs) and its heterogeneous palladium catalyst through anchoring on FPPOPs bearing a phosphine ligand, in which the fabrication of FPPOPs was completed through the vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3) and vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (ViPOSS) as well as functional olefins via radical co&#8208;polymerization. All these FPPOPs could act as a phosphine ligand for Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes have been characterized by SEM, FTIR, and X&#8208;RAD. Moreover, the POSS&#8208;based functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (POSS&#8208;PPOPs) proved to be a high efficiency catalyst system for Si&#8208;C bond &#8208;forming arylation of hydrosilanes with aryl iodides and with good yields as well as excellent chemoselectivity with low amount of catalyst under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non&#8208;covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilization of Hypervalent Bonds as a Novel Strategy for Manipulating Energy Levels of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical properties created by the combination of azobenzene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing effects to the directly attached &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The resulting hypervalent compounds have a dramatically narrow energy gap showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission despite the limited size of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. In addition, the hypervalent compounds also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements in both crystals and &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer films. We also explain that the nature of hypervalent bonds depends on the element type, which is particularly effective in bringing out the properties of heavy elements. In this review, we describe that the use of hypervalent bonds is a novel strategy not only for manipulating the energy levels of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system but also for developing a variety of functional materials based on the newly rising properties from hypervalent element.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new family of stable radical&#8208;containing polytopic ligands based on tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines TPMA architecture and their corresponding metal complexes have been synthesized. These molecular systems offered the possibility to investigate how various spin carriers, such as the metal ion and the organic radical, influence their EPR properties mainly through the empirical ratio of peak heights d1/d. Moreover, it has been possible to analyze how different conformations of TEMPO radical units in the molecular skeleton affect the metallic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Depending on In/Out Isomerism of Host&#8208;Guest Conjugate Having a Fluorosolvatochromic Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest conjugate is a promising strategy for providing outstanding molecules. Herein, we designed host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, which comprises a hydrophilic host unit, tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2with a microhydrophobic cavity, and a guest unit, 2,3&#8208;naphthalimide fused with two benzothiophenes G1 exhibiting fluorosolvatochromism, linked with an oxyethylene chain. HG1 initially showed a fluorescence band at 585 nm in MeOH/H2O (1/499 v/v); however, this band decreased with time, and instead, a new band at 430 nm appeared. The CIE chromaticity diagram showed that the fluorescent color changed from yellow&#8208;orange to blue via white. NMR analysis of HG1 in methanol&#8208;d4 exhibited different signals of the G1 unit between the blue and yellow fluorescent structures. The blue fluorescent structures showed asymmetrical signals assigned as the G1 unit, affected by the cavity environment of the CPX2 unit. Consequently, HG1 can form two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. In In&#8208;form, the G1 unit is inside the hydrophobic cavity of the CPX2 unit and shows blue fluorescence. In Out&#8208;form, the G1 unit is outside the CPX2 unit and shows yellow fluorescence in an aqueous solvent. Therefore, HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.</dc:description>

NMR analysis of HG1 in methanol-d4 exhibited different signals of the G1 unit between the blue and yellow fluorescent structures. The blue fluorescent structures showed asymmetrical signals assigned as the G1 unit, affected by the cavity environment of the CPX2 unit. Consequently, HG1 can form two conformations: In-form and Out-form. In In-form, the G1 unit is inside the hydrophobic cavity of the CPX2 unit and shows blue fluorescence. In Out-form, the G1 unit is outside the CPX2 unit and shows yellow fluorescence in an aqueous solvent.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates With Triazolium Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid phase synthesis of lysine and peptide conjugates of Safirinium derivatives allowed demonstration of the relevance of Safirinium&#8208;lysine conjugates and building blocks as inhibitors of porcine pancrease elastase.







Abstract
Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates. Herein we present the design and synthesis of four Safirinium derivatives, their facile conjugation to lysine in solid phase, and incorporation in peptides. The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed. We present herein the potential of the Safirinium analogs to act as elastase inhibitors in assays performed on porcine pancreas elastase.

         <title>Organocatalysis for Enantioselective Decarboxylative Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic decarboxylation is a straightforward and environmentally friendly strategy for synthesizing various new carbon scaffolds. This methodology, inspired by natural biosynthetic processes, has been established for the formal preparation of enols from carboxyl compounds under mild conditions. Remarkable advances in the field of organocatalysis have enabled the control of stereoselectivity in this strategy.







Abstract
The catalytic decarboxylation of malonic acid half oxy&#8208; and thioesters, &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids, and their related compounds is a straightforward, powerful, and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the in&#8208;situ formation of enolates, which are important and well&#8208;studied synthons for various functional materials and natural products. This strategy, inspired by the biosynthesis of polyketides and fatty acids, is an attractive method for synthesizing enols from carboxyl compounds with less reactive &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms under mild conditions. In addition, these reactions are environmentally friendly and are of great interest to chemists because the use of a stoichiometric amount of base can be avoided, and the only byproduct is CO2. Thus far, remarkable progress has been made, especially in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions, allowing for the stereocontrolled formation of new C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;heteroatom, and C&#8722;X bonds. This review provides a comprehensive overview of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions and highlights the significant progress made since 2020. In particular, it focuses on chiral catalyst systems and transition states as key parameters for decarboxylation reactions.

         <dc:description>The research of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex&#160;has developed fast in the field of photochemistry. Herein, the green and efficient metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been achieved with 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde&#160;and bromodifluoroacetamide, which is driven by noncovalent interactions between 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde/N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylene diamine &#160;(TMEDA) and&#160;bromodifluoroacetamide/TMEDA. By precisely optimizing the electron donor and reaction solvent, a wide range of&#160;structurally diverse difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones, including aryl amide, aliphatic amide and ester groups, were obtained in up to 76% yields. This strategy offers the benefits of simple operation, good yields, high atomic economy and broad applicability, providing an essential complement to traditional approaches for the preparation of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons without any transition metals, photocatalysts or oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and In&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Aromatic Endoperoxides Acting as Oxygen Releasing Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia occurs in different pathological settings as a consequence of poor vascularization, and it results in reduced efficacy of some current nosocomial treatments i.e. chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. In order to overcome these boundaries, aromatic endoperoxides (EPOs) have been studied and proposed as oxygen&#8208;releasing agents (ORAs) due to their ability to reversibly bind molecular oxygen (O2), liberating it upon suitable triggering. DFT calculation of the dissociation energy (Ediss) of the intramolecular O&#8208;O bridge and structural crystallographic data of synthesized and studied EPOs drove the design of an array of 9,10&#8208;disubstituted anthracenes among which three candidates were carefully selected. Once optimized the synthesis of the aromatic substrates, for the first time the corresponding EPOs have been produced under continuous flow irradiation in the presence of a sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of a photosensitizer in organic solvents. The release of O2 could be obtained straightforwardly at 37.5 &#176;C by thermolysis. In accordance with the calculated Ediss = 3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1 and an experimental t1/2 = 40 minutes, 3,3'&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol) resulted as the best candidate for the sustained release of O2 under physiologically relevant conditions. Its exploitation as ORA to relieve hypoxia will be evaluated and described in due course.</dc:description>

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal reactions including Cope rearrangements and E/Z isomerisations of three diterpenoids were investigated experimentally. In addition, DFT calculations were performed to explain the experimental findings of this study and of related systems from the literature. It is demonstrated that accurate computational data are only obtained, if ensembles of most stable conformers are considered.







Abstract
Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8800;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;Diketones Towards Catalytic Asymmetric Domino Michael&#8211;Henry Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyst with unique properties &#8211; 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine &#8211; activates unsymmetrical diketones by forming an enamine from only one side, while enolization does not constitute a significant competing mechanism.







Abstract
In this study, we explored a method to distinguish between both enolizable regions of unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diketones in organocatalytic domino reactions involving nitroalkenes. The selective formation of an enamine from only one side of the molecule was made possible by the use of optically pure 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine. This catalyst, remarkably enhancing the reaction, owes its efficacy to a unique interplay between basicity and nucleophilicity. These features caused the enolization of the substrate at the second possible site to be omitted. The approach resulted in excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (91&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) across various nitroalkenes, leading to the synthesis of novel cyclopentanone derivatives with three contiguous stereogenic center.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines in the MCR Universe</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, a privileged class of heterocycles with extensive applications in organic and medicinal chemistry, in four distinct IMCRs, aiming to generate compound libraries compatible for structural elaboration. Four scaffolds, 15 novel compounds with high diversity and complexity, along with single crystal structures for each scaffold have been obtained, revealing their potential relevance in drug discovery.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines constitute an accessible class of lead&#8208;like heterocycles with a vast application in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.

         <title>Trifluoromethylsulfinyl Compounds: Recent Synthetic Approaches and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. The review systematically summarizes recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. Compared with the indirect methods, direct trifluoromethylsulfinylation by employing available trifluoromethylsulfinylating reagents is an important and elegant strategy for the rapid assembly of valuable CF3S(O)&#8208;derived organic molecules. This review focuses on the recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high yields and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

Herein, we report a mild Lewis acid&#8208;promoted regiospecific and reaction course&#8208;dependent transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarins/4&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones/4&#8208;azido&#8208;thiocoumarin into structurally diversified C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazoles via single step and 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepines via two steps with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration, through the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine and cyclic indium complex.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient route for coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazole scaffolds via indium chloride&#8208;mediated single&#8208;step transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin with amines/aldehydes and coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepine scaffolds with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration through two&#8208;step sequential synthesis via the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. A plausible mechanistic pathway has been proposed from the control/entrapment experiments and 1H&#8208;NMR studies. This protocol provides the reaction condition&#8208;dependent product selectivity, structural diversification, and excellent yields.

A highly effective method utilizing KOtBu is reported for the regioselective production of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles.







Abstract
A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ transformation of the nitrile moiety into an amide group followed by the selective C&#8722;N bond formation through a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies as it avoids use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affords the products in high yields. Additionally, the current methodology provides several additional advantages, such as one&#8208;pot operation, high atom economy, broad substrate scope and a step&#8208;economical process.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryl N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;Protected Diamines via Organocatalytic Arylation of 5&#8208;Aminoisoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.

         <title>Fluorinated Chiral Pyrans Obtained via Mechanochemical Organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.

         <title>Directed Arylation of 7&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane to Prepare 3D Fragments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework via use of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Cleavage of the directing group provided the corresponding primary amides, which may be of value in drug discovery as &#8216;3D&#8217; fragments.







Abstract
Directed Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework is described. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Different minor diarylated side products were formed, depending on whether electron deficient aryl or pyridyl iodides were used as the coupling partners. Cleavage of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group provided small bridged compounds that may be of value in fragment based drug discovery.

         <title>Denitrative Formal [5+1] Cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;Yn&#8208;1&#8208;Ones with Thioacetamide under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions: Synthesis of Thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;Ones</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones were synthesized by the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis or the exclusion of air or moisture. The reaction is thought to exploit the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. A nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade gave the S&#8208;heterocyclic products in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.







Abstract
A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.

An array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols were synthesized using iodohydroxylation of gem&#8208;difluorinated allyl aryl ethers followed by epoxidation and ring&#8208;opening with an amine in a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step fashion. This approach allows the synthesis of a set of gem&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis of an array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols in a one&#8208;pot epoxidation/nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening via the corresponding iodohydrines is described. This methodology permits the construction of 1,1&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers in addition to unprecedented members of this compound class.
