         <title>Design and Synthesis of Chemiluminescent Cassettes Based on Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a new strategy to obtain near infrared emitting (NIR) chemiluminescent probes. The synthesis of green&#8208; or NIR&#8208;emitting chemiluminescent cassettes was achieved. Their photophysical study proved that efficient energy transfer occurs even in the absence of a favourable spectral overlap between the emission of the chemiluminescent platform and the tethered fluorophore.







Abstract
Chemiluminescent probes are being considered as a convenient option for optical imaging. Several strategies were reported to increase the probe chemiluminescence efficiency. In this study, a series of chemiluminescent cassettes based on adamantyl stabilized 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes (&#8220;Schaap's dioxetane&#8221;) linked to a fluorophore (BODIPY or dicyanoisophorone fluorophore) by a conjugated linker have been synthetized. Their chemiluminescent decomposition and the photoluminescence properties of their respective emissive species were investigated.

         <dc:description>
An oxidative C&#8722;H bond annulation of 2 arylquinoxalines with cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones has been developed for the synthesis of polycyclic quinoxaline frameworks. This method involves C&#8722;H bond activation and double C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines with cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones has been accomplished for the first time to synthesize a novel series of 2,3&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one frameworks by means of carbene insertion followed by condensation. The reaction proceeds through the C&#8722;H bond activation and functionalization of 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines using Rh(III)/AgSbF6 complex to produce highly substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one and benzo[5,6][1,2,4]thiadiazino[2,3&#8208;f]phenanthridin&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;one&#8208;10,10&#8208;dioxide derivatives in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Reactivity Tuning of Metal&#8208;Free Artificial Photoenzymes through Binding Site Specific Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free artificial photoenzyme was designed based on the human steroid carrier protein (SCP&#8208;2L), which possesses a hydrophobic tunnel and facilitates substrate binding. Three variants of SCP&#8208;2L were bioconjugated with a photocatalytic moiety and used for selective oxidation of organic sulfides giving up to 192 turnovers depending on the binding side of the photocatalyst.







Abstract
The design and development of artificial metal&#8208;free photoenzymes aims to combine the selectivity of enzymatic reactions with the benefits of modern synthetic photocatalysts. Removing the need for rare earth metals and allowing for milder reaction conditions, leading to a more sustainable catalytic system. Here, we present the design of a novel artificial photoenzyme by integrating an organophotocatalytic moiety based on a donor&#8208;acceptor design into a steroid carrier protein (SCP&#8208;2L). SCP&#8208;2L possesses a hydrophobic tunnel facilitating substrate binding in aqueous media. The photocatalyst was site&#8208;selectively bound to three SCP&#8208;2L variants, possessing a non&#8208;native cysteine residue strategically placed around the hydrophobic tunnel of the protein. The three modified photoenzymes were shown to be selective for the oxidation of organic sulfides giving up to 192 turnovers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Light&#8208;Mediated, Site&#8208;Specific, Radical C6&#8722;H Alkylation of Purines with Alcohols Intervened by Oxalates without Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical protocol for highly regioselective C6&#8722;H alkylation of purines with alcohols intervened by oxalates under blue LED irradiation is reported. This transformation does not need transition metal catalysts, is not sensitive to moisture and does not require N2 protection. Besides, this method displays broad functional groups compatibility and is easily scale up.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of a radical deoxy&#8208;functionalization strategy for the direct C&#8722;H alkylation of purines and purine nucleosides with alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;) intervened by oxalates under 12&#8197;W blue LED irradiation. The reaction shows high regioselectivity at C6&#8722;H position of purine and is suitable for N9&#8208;, N7&#8208;substitued purines. The process accommodates purines and alcohols to deliver a wide range of products (31 examples) in 41&#8211;91&#8201;% yields, which avoids transition metal catalysts and organometallic reagents, and is not sensitive to moisture and air. Besides, the mild protocol displays broad functional groups tolerance and is easily up scalable to gram scale and can be used for late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H alkylation of purine to synthesize pharmaceutical 6&#8208;cyclopentyl nebularine with anti&#8208;CEM activity or natural d&#8208;menthol modification.

         <title>Synthetic Studies Concerned with the Proposed Structure of Ribisin F, a Compound with Nerve Growth Factor Potentiating Activity Isolated from the Medicinal Fungus Phellinus ribis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, from quinic acid, of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been accomplished but the derived spectral data do not match those reported for ribisin F. A related synthesis of its C3 epimer suggests that this may represent the true structure.







Abstract
The synthesis of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been achieved from abundant quinic acid. However, the NMR spectral data acquired on the synthetic material do not match those reported for ribisin F (which are of rather modest quality). In an effort to establish the true structure of ribisin F, an epimer of the assigned structure was also prepared from quinic acid. A comparison of the spectral data obtained on this epimer with those reported for the natural product proved a better match and based on optical rotation data the possible true structure of this distinctive, dihydroxylated and benzofuran&#8208;containing compound is tentatively proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the title natural product has been achieved from abundant quinic acid. However, the NMR spectral data acquired on the synthetic material do not match those reported for ribisin F (which are of rather modest quality). In an effort to establish the true structure of ribisin F, an epimer of the assigned structure was also prepared from quinic acid. A comparison of the spectral data obtained on this epimer with those reported for the natural product proved a better match and based on optical rotation data the possible true structure of this distinctive, dihydroxylated and benzofuran-containing compound is tentatively proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The efficient preparation and investigation of so far unknown heterotriacenes, basic anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;dithienopyrazine 5 and 6 is reported. The comparison of the two isomers with respect to electronic properties and follow&#8208;up reactions gives insights into structure&#8208;property and &#8208;reactivity relationships. Examples of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions of corresponding halogenated derivatives show the practical impact for extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems applied in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Heteroacenes developed to widely used building blocks in organic semiconductors for application in organic electronics due to their tunable structures and properties concomitant with inherent stability. Here, we report efficient preparation and investigation of so far unknown heterotriacenes, basic anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;dithienopyrazine 5 and 6. The comparison of the two isomers with respect to electronic properties and follow&#8208;up reactions gives insights into structure&#8208;property and &#8208;reactivity relationships. Examples of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions of corresponding halogenated derivatives show the practical impact for extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems applied in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Seiricuprolide and Pestalotioprolide B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first and convergent total syntheses of seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B, 14&#8208;membered macrolides bearing a chiral epoxide moiety. The key synthetic features include OH&#8208;directed m&#8208;CPBA epoxidation, selective reduction of propargylic alcohol, acetylide addition and Shiina macrolactonization. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship study suggests that the &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety suppresses cytotoxic activity on HCT116 colon cancer cells and CFTR inhibitory effect of both macrolides.







Abstract
The first total syntheses of seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B, rare 14&#8208;membered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated macrolides embedding a chiral epoxide motif, were achieved in 17 steps with 1.9&#8201;% and 1.6&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. Our synthesis featured the key Shiina macrolactonization to construct the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic skeleton, Wittig olefination to generate the (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester and selective reduction of advanced chiral propargylic alcohol intermediate to enable the exclusive formation of Z&#8208; or E&#8208;olefin at C8&#8722;C9. Synthetic seiricuprolide and pestalotioprolide B were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against the HCT116 colon cancer cell line as well as their inhibitory effect on CFTR chloride channel activity in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship suggested that the C5&#8722;C6 &#946;&#8208;epoxide moiety suppressed both biological activities.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208; or UVA&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hydroxamic Acids from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208; or UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of hydroxamic acids from carboxylic acids and protected hydroxylamines is reported, the key step of which is the formation of a charge transfer complex. Mechanistic studies by DI&#8208;HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates. Two hydroxamic drugs (Vorinostat and Bufexamac) were synthesized.







Abstract
The development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications is increasingly attracting high interest. We present herein a new photochemical protocol for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids, which constitute an important class of medicinal agents, mainly due to their anticancer properties. The method is mediated by UVA&#8208;light or sunlight and its key point is the generation of a charge transfer complex by the interaction of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine with a halomethane. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled with O&#8208;protected hydroxylamines, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or solar light. A detailed study of the mechanism was carried out by the employment of direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8208;HRMS), providing experimental evidence for the formation of various activated species, which may lead to the desired product. The light&#8208;mediated protocol was applied in the synthesis of the drugs Vorinostat and Bufexamac.

A highly efficient synthesis of benzo[d][1,3]diazepines has been achieved via RuII&#8208;catalyzed regioselective [5+2] annulation reaction of N&#8208;Aryl amidines with alkynyl cyclobutyl acetates.







Abstract
A highly efficient strategy to construct benzo[d][1,3]diazepines via selective C&#8722;H bond activation of N&#8208;aryl amidines and coupling with alkynyl cyclobutyl acetates was achieved successfully by RuII&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cyclization. This protocol features excellent regioselectivity, wide substrate tolerance, mild reaction conditions, which might be potentially applied in the discovery of lead compounds for the developing new drugs.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient strategy to construct benzo[d][1,3]diazepines via selective C&#8722;H bond activation of N-aryl amidines and coupling with alkynyl cyclobutyl acetates was achieved successfully by Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed [5+2] cyclization. This protocol features excellent regioselectivity, wide substrate tolerance, mild reaction conditions, which might be potentially applied in the discovery of lead compounds for the developing new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of the N&#8208;Amykitanosyl Tetramic Acid Moiety of Amycolamicin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;amykitanosyl tetramic acid derivative, Li's synthetic intermediate for the antibiotic amycolamicin, has been synthesized via stereoconvergent lactamization of a cyclic carbonate&#8208;protected N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine ester, prepared from l&#8208;fucose more efficiently than before, and opening of the carbonate ring with lithium dibenzylamide to regioselectively install a carbamate functionality.







Abstract
An improved five&#8208;step synthetic route from l&#8208;fucose to an N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine methyl ester has been developed. The new route involves glycosidation of l&#8208;fucose with phenol in a &#946;&#8208;selective manner without protection/deprotection steps and one&#8208;pot stereochemical inversion of a secondary alcohol intermediate and is superior to our previous one both in the number of steps and in overall yield. An N&#8208;glycosyl l&#8208;valine benzyl ester, prepared from l&#8208;fucose in an analogous way, has been elaborated into an N&#8208;amykitanosyl tetramic acid derivative, Li's synthetic intermediate for amycolamicin, via a four&#8208;step sequence which features the utilization of Bestmann's ylide to stereoconvergently construct an N&#8208;glycosyl tetramic acid intermediate in a single step, opening of a cyclic carbonate ring with an amine to regioselectively install a carbamate functionality, and visible light&#8208;mediated oxidative debenzylation of an N,N&#8208;dibenzyl carbamate.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Camptothecin&#8208;like Scaffolds: Construction of a New Class of Pseudo&#8208;natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NP) strategy has become one of the most important tools to deliver biologically significant chemical probes. In this article, we describe the development of a new class of pseudo&#8208;NP collection that led to the synthesis of camptothecin&#8208;like analogues. This process is driven by a cascade that unites Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with Michael addition reaction, followed by oxidative&#8208;ring enlargement and subsequent transannular aldol cyclization delivering camptothecin&#8208;like architectures.







Abstract
The discovery of novel small molecules endowed with high 3D&#8208;content remains a powerful tool for interrogating underrepresented biological space. To this end, the pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NP) strategy has become one of the most important tools to deliver biologically significant chemical probes. In this article, we describe the development of a new class of pseudo&#8208;NP collection, through connecting tryptamines with a furanose derivative followed by subjecting the product from this operation to a ring distortion strategy that led to diastereoselective synthesis of camptothecin&#8208;like compounds. This process is driven by a cascade that unites Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with Michael addition reaction, followed by oxidative&#8208;ring enlargement and subsequent transannular aldol cyclization delivering camptothecin&#8208;like architectures. The obtained diastereoselectivity was verified using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Triarylamines and Poly(triarylamine)s through a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular synthesis of triarylamines and poly(triarylamine)s has been achieved by using diarylamines and electron&#8208;rich arenes as the building blocks. Through the modulation of reaction temperatures, the stepwise assembly of bis&#8208;triarylamines could be realized efficiently. Furthermore, the multiple aminated polyphenols were rapidly constructed by a single step. This method should find applications in the synthesis of triarylamine&#8208;type photocatalysts and optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
A modular protocol for the triarylamine synthesis has been developed using diarylamines and electron&#8208;rich arenes, such as phenols, as the building blocks. The KI/KIO4 system proves to be highly efficient for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of phenothiazines/phenoxazines with phenols/anilines. A wide range of functional groups attached to both coupling partners were well tolerated. Through the manipulation of reaction temperatures, the sequential assembly of bis&#8208;triarylamines could be achieved to provide the unsymmetrically bis&#8208;aminated phenols efficiently. Furthermore, the multiple aminated polyphenols were rapidly constructed in good to high yields by a single operation.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 11H&#8208;Indolo[3,2&#8208;c]quinolines and Neocryptolepine from a Common Starting Material</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common intermediate gives easy access to both neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine analogues in up to 80&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% yield, respectively.







Abstract
A large number of diversely functionalized analogs of the bioactive natural products neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine have been prepared from a series of 3&#8208;bromoquinoline derivatives. The neocryptolepines were obtained by a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling followed by C&#8722;N bond formation in yields up to 80&#8201;%, whereas the indoloquinolines were prepared by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling followed by azidation&#8208;photochemical cyclization in yields ranging from traces to 95&#8201;% yield.

&lt;p&gt;A common intermediate gives easy access to both neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine analogues in up to 80&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% yield, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of diversely functionalized analogs of the bioactive natural products neocryptolepine and isocryptolepine have been prepared from a series of 3-bromoquinoline derivatives. The neocryptolepines were obtained by a Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling followed by C&#8722;N bond formation in yields up to 80&#8201;%, whereas the indoloquinolines were prepared by a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling followed by azidation-photochemical cyclization in yields ranging from traces to 95&#8201;% yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The kingdom ruled by Tin The Tyrant has expanded since then, spreading its roots all over the continent. Despite a few attempts to dethrone the Tyrant, he remains undefeated. However, rumors are starting to spread that an army of reagents is beginning to gather. Could the end of the last fortress of the tyranny of tin be in sight?&#8220; This review provides the historical development and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8211;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin&#8242;s tyranny.&#8221; The authors would like to thank Katar&#237;na&#8197;R.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ortho&#8208;Quinols are chiral 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives of interest to organic chemists because of their natural occurrence, their role as intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse natural products, and the versatility of their chemical reactivity. Readily accessible from dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenols or other arenols, ortho&#8208;quinols constitute useful molecular entities from which structural complexity can be rapidly built, as highlighted herein through many examples of targeted syntheses of natural products, such as trichodimerol.







Abstract
6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70&#8197;years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.

         <title>The Last Fortress of Tin's Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 13, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods used for the protodenitration of nitroalkanes were reviewed. Despite several decades of intense research, the most frequently used option remains the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing toxic tributyltin hydride. Thus, the protodenitration of nitroalkanes remains the last fortress of the tyranny of tin.







Abstract
Protodenitration, a direct reduction of nitroalkanes to corresponding alkanes, already spans two centuries and is enabled by various reagents. This mini&#8208;review provides a historical development of the fundamental transformation and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride and environmentally unpopular solvents sharply contrasting with modern ecological trends, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin's tyranny.&#8221;

         <title>Tetrathiaporphyrine: A Novel Natural Product from Allium Subgenus Melanocrommyum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structure of a red pigment from Allium species, subgenus Melanocrommyum, has been successfully elucidated using X&#8208;ray crystallography. This revealed the compound to be a tetrathiaporphyrine, which has been synthesized in two steps starting from pyrrole.







Abstract
A novel purple&#8208;red pigment from the plant genus of Allium (onions, leeks), subgenus Melanocrommyum (drumstick onions), is described. Because of this pigment, which reminds of blood, some species of the subgenus Melanocrommyum are used in Southwest and Central Asia as herbal medications, as spices or as vegetables. A proposal for the formation of this structure is provided, which is the first example of a tetrathiaporphyrin in nature. The described substance shows low stability towards thermal stress, light and oxidant; additionally, its symmetric nature made structural elucidation a challenge. It could be shown that, contrary to previous reports, the structure of the red pigment is that of a tetrathiaporphyrin. Full structure elucidation was only possible by X&#8208;ray crystallography and total synthesis of the intended molecule. Further on, the newly discovered red pigment was used for the modification of nanoparticles and monitoring its polymerization events using SPR.

A proposal for the formation of this structure is provided, which is the first example of a tetrathiaporphyrin in nature. The described substance shows low stability towards thermal stress, light and oxidant; additionally, its symmetric nature made structural elucidation a challenge. It could be shown that, contrary to previous reports, the structure of the red pigment is that of a tetrathiaporphyrin. Full structure elucidation was only possible by X-ray crystallography and total synthesis of the intended molecule. Further on, the newly discovered red pigment was used for the modification of nanoparticles and monitoring its polymerization events using SPR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decarboxylative Mannich Reactions with N&#8208;Alkyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of N&#8208;alkyl imines in decarboxylative Mannich reaction with substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) has been developed to afford a direct access to secondary &#946;2,3&#8208;aminoesters. The transformation occurs under very practical conditions (DABCO as a catalyst in bulk toluene and open to air) and can be performed with a broad range of each substrates in yields of 36 to 97%. Importantly, the reaction was found to require the use of acidic additives in combination with the organocatalyst to limit the competitive olefination reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as one of the important endogenous biological regulator, playing a critical role in mediating a wide range of physiological processes.

In this paper, a new type of AIE&#8208;based fluorescence "turn&#8208;on" probe TPA&#8208;M&#160;for the detection of H2S has been constructed.

         <title>Axial Chirality in Alkylidene&#8208;Cyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial chirality is an interesting stereoisomeric phenomenon in organic chemistry and a key structural feature of several organic compounds. Atropisomer such as biaryls, anilides and diaryl ethers is one type of axially chiral compound, whose axial chirality is resulted from rotationally blocked C&#8211;X (C, N, O) single bond. Allenes, spiranes and alkylidenecycloalkanes are another type of axially chiral compounds and their axial chirality come from the perpendicular geometry of two pairs of substituents. The axial chirality in atropisomers, allenes and spiranes have been widely investigated and well developed, while the similar chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules gained very limited attentions. This concept focuses on summarizing recent advances of axial chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules and arouses the research interests to this promising field.</dc:description>

Abstract
A rapid and efficient acid&#8208;promoted strategy to access allylic thiocyanates using allylic alcohols as substrates and easily&#8208;available NH4SCN as the thiocyanate source is presented under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Through screening of various kinds of acids, organic and strong trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was found most effective. Testing of substrates showed that the strategy has remarkable functional group tolerance. A possible mechanism is provided, and the gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrate that this novel protocol has potential industrial application value.

         <title>Catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay for Synthesis of Fluorescent Naphthoquinolizinium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded polyaromatic hydrocarbons with a planar geometry. The synthetic pathway is based on catalytic C&#8211;C/C&#8211;H bond activation relay that enabled preparation of regioselectively 5,6,10,11&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of selected compounds confirmed planarity of the quinolizinium core. Most of the prepared compounds exhibited strong fluorescence (up to &gt;99%) ranging from 420&#8208;600 nm depending on the substitution pattern.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel cationic nitrogen-embedded polyaromatic hydrocarbons with a planar geometry. The synthetic pathway is based on catalytic C&#8211;C/C&#8211;H bond activation relay that enabled preparation of regioselectively 5,6,10,11-tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8-ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. Single-crystal X-ray analyses of selected compounds confirmed planarity of the quinolizinium core. Most of the prepared compounds exhibited strong fluorescence (up to &amp;gt;99%) ranging from 420-600 nm depending on the substitution pattern. According to DFT calculations LUMO is always distributed over the quinolizinium framework regardless of the attached substituents, whereas delocalization of HOMO is related to the substitution pattern. Electrochemical measurements show irreversible reduction of all compounds, which is supported by the calculated location of LUMO orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemistry and Applications of Functionalized 2,4&#8208;Thiazolidinediones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiazolidinedione (TZD) is one of the privileged heterocyclic rings and has shown many biological applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. The manuscript covers the synthetic approaches of TZD and its derivatives, different synthetic techniques for affording the desired regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, and the techniques that would enhance reaction conditions such as microwave, one&#8208;pot, ultrasound synthesis. One of topics focused in this review is the synthetic challenges of glitazones and the transformation of other heterocycles to TZD. Moreover, the current review discusses the chemical and biological behavior of TZD through the substitution in the N3 position, modification of the C5 position, annealing in complex heterocyclic systems, and hybridization with other pharmacologically attractive moieties. All reactions mentioned are provided as possible with different reaction conditions, mechanisms, derivatives scope, yield and clarified by applications of such reactions in the construction of potential medicinal agents. The review also answers questions about rapid racemization of glitazones, their toxicity, considering TZD as pan&#8208;assay interference compounds (PAINS) or not, and the influence of saturation of 5&#8208;position of TZD in their biological activities. The main objective of the current review is to guide the reader to make informed decisions for construction of TZD derivatives with biological potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Controlled Hydrogenation of Flavanones: Selective Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;Diarylpropanes and Flavans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new substrate&#8208;controlled hydrogenation of flavanones to selectively obtain 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes or flavans depending on the substitution of the flavanone moiety is described. Thus, hydrogenation of non&#8208;fluorinated flavanones provided the corresponding 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes, whereas hydrogenation of fluorinated flavanones afforded selectively the corresponding flavans in excellent yields.







Abstract
A new substrate&#8208;controlled hydrogenation of flavanones to selectively obtain different hydrogenation products is herein reported. Thus, hydrogenation of flavanones bearing different electron&#8208;donating and electron withdrawing substituents (Cl, Br, Me, OMe, OH) provided the corresponding 1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes in excellent yields. This procedure offers a straightforward, simple, and cost&#8208;effective method for the preparation of glycosylated 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes derived from natural flavanones such as Naringin and Hesperedin. On the contrary, when the hydrogenation was performed over fluorinated flavanones, the corresponding flavans were selectively obtained in excellent yields.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Linearly Fused Triquinanes via Tandem&#8208;Metathesis: Access to Basic Core of Cucumin, Capnellene, Chondrosterin, and Xeromphalinone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a short synthetic approach to linearly fused tricyclic enone 1 and cis&#8208;anti&#8208;cis type hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2 has been described in an efficient manner by employing tandem&#8208;metathesis as a key step. The triquinane&#8208;based enone 1 is prepared by a Babler&#8208;Dauben oxidation of hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2, which is assembled by following a three&#8208;step sequence involving a regio&#8208; and stereoselective allylation, vinyl Grignard addition, and tandem&#8208;metathesis. Our strategy rely on exo&#8208;tricyclic ketone, which is derived from readily available exo&#8208;dicyclopentadiene&#8208;1&#8208;one. The newly synthesized molecules were identified and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. It is worth mentioning that tricyclic enone 1 is present as a core unit of many naturally occurring polyquinanes, particularly xeromphalinone family members. Hence, our approach may be useful in the synthesis of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylation: Extended Substrate Scope and Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid sidechains have been functionalized and glycosylated without the aid of catalysts or additives. Disarmed glycosyl donors were found to react efficiently and excess glycosyl acceptor as well as trichloroacetamide could effectively be removed by aqueous workup. The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;promoted glycosylation was studied by constructing Hammett plots.







Abstract
A self&#8208;promoted glycosylation method for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;glucosides from a substrate library of glycosyl trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors and glycosyl acceptors is presented. The simple two&#8208;component reaction takes place at elevated temperatures, without the addition of any additives or catalysts. After a simple basic workup, N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in good yields and with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and hence this method allows for easy access to glycoconjugates under very mild conditions. The influences of neighboring group participation and substituents, in both the glycosyl donor and acceptor, were studied. Kinetic data were obtained from in&#8197;situ IR and these were used for a Hammett study. A connection between the pKa of the acceptor and reaction rate was found and new mechanistic insight in self&#8208;promoted glycosylations gained.

         <title>White Light/NIS&#8208;Promoted Aminoselenylation of Alkenes by Using N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and diorganyl diselenides for the synthesis of organylselenylethyl sulfonylhydrazones is disclosed, in which 42 products were synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (51&#8201;%&#8211;85&#8201;%). In addition, the reaction proceeded well at room temperature in air, without any metal, using ethyl acetate as an environmentally benign solvent.







Abstract
A white light/iodosuccinimide (NIS)&#8208;promoted three component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones, and diorganyl diselenides for synthesis of organylselenylethyl sulfonylhydrazones under air is disclosed. This intermolecular aminoselenylation of alkenes using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as nitrogen source was performed under mild conditions and well tolerated for common groups. In addition, heteroaryl and aliphatic diselenides also gave the target compounds. Gram&#8208;scale reaction also carried out smoothly. This protocol has a wide range of substrates and affords moderate to high yields and excellent regioselectivities. The photoactive intermediates from the interaction between NIS and diphenyl diselenide was detected by UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra, which matches the wavelength of the applied white LED. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on UV&#8208;visible light experiments and control experiments.

         <dc:description>
This work reports a method for the synthesis of biaryls using inexpensive aryl fluorosulfonates coupled with electrophilic reagents, which enhances the selectivity of the cross&#8208;coupling products by palladium and nickel cooperative catalysis. This reaction can be carried out at room temperature with excellent yields.







Abstract
Multimetallic catalysis can effectively enhance the selectivity for the heterocoupling product over homocoupling products in cross&#8208;electrophilic couplings. We report the selective cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with aryl fluorosulfonates via palladium and nickel cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of biaryls, which can be carried out at room temperature while having marvelous chemoselectivity. In addition, the reaction also has a good performance on the gram&#8208;scale reaction.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Exocyclic Cyclitol Aziridines as Potential Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inactivators</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophellitol aziridines have found wide application as mechanism&#8208;based, covalent and irreversible inhibitors of retaining glycosidases. These compounds, like their parent compound, cyclophellitol (a natural product retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inactivator), make use of the mechanism of action of retaining glycosidases, which process their substrate through the formation of a transient covalent intermediate. In contrast, inverting glycosidases, the other main family of glycosyl hydrolases, do not employ such a covalent intermediate and as a consequence useful scaffolds for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design have yet to be discovered. In this work, we explore chemistries that allow for the construction of cyclitol aziridines with the aziridine electrophile attached in an exocyclic fashion, more distal from the anomeric carbon &#8211; thus putatively closer to an inverting glycosidase active site nucleophile. The developed chemistries have allowed for the synthesis of a focused library of differently N&#8208;substituted, &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;glucopyranose configured cyclitol aziridines for future evaluation as inhibitors or inactivators of &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;glucosidases alike.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;Dioxaborinine Hybrid Dyes: Synthesis and Substituent Effect in the Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of hybrid fluorophores based on the pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;dioxaborinine (PP&#8208;DB) system is provided by constructing the dioxaborinine moiety on the fused ring in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
A novel family of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;dioxaborinine (PP&#8208;DB) hybrid dyes was synthesized by the direct construction of the dioxaborinine (DB) fragment on the pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine (PP) ring, which implies the formation of four new bonds in a one&#8208;pot manner. The dyes&#8217; optical properties were investigated and compared with the starting pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines; a study evidencing large fluorescence quantum yields in products (&#966;f up to 69&#8201;%) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process from the PP core to a ring of DB (PP&#8594;DB) that is absent in precursors (&#966;f=0.03&#8211;0.30). Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations confirmed the fluorescence process involved in the novel dyes, where their ICT limits the non&#8208;radiative process due to the restricted rotation in the D&#8722;A system. The present work provides insight into how phenyl and DB ring incorporation impact the optical properties of this new group of hybrids dyes based on PP&#8208;DB.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven protocol to access alkyl boronic acid pinacol esters from vinyl boronate using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters as the alkyl generator was developed. A good substrate scope was examined, demonstrating good to high yields and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A novel and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute light&#8208;driven protocol for the preparation of alkyl boronic acid pinacol esters from vinyl boronate using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters as the potential precursor is described. In this photochemical protocol, the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester's fragmentation generates C&#8208;centered radicals, which undergo a radical Michael addition to vinyl boronic pinacol ester furnishing the desired products. A good substrate scope having various functionalities is presented and good to high yields are obtained.

In this photochemical protocol, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide ester's fragmentation generates C-centered radicals, which undergo a radical Michael addition to vinyl boronic pinacol ester furnishing the desired products. A good substrate scope having various functionalities is presented and good to high yields are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylation of Indole&#8208;Tethered Alkene Enables Synthesis of CF3&#8208;Containing Spiroindolenines and Tetrahydrocarbazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylation of indole&#8208;tethered alkene with Togni&#8217;s reagent to construct CF3&#8208;containing spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidine] and tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives under mild and convenient conditions has been disclosed. The mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceed through a CF3 radical addition to the alkene, followed by sequential dearomatizing spiocyclization of the indole and oxidation to afford the spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidine] derivatives. Meanwhile, when the substituent at the C2 position of the indole is hydrogen, the CF3&#8208;containing tetrahydrocarbazole is obtained through trifluoromethylation of alkene and cyclization of indole.</dc:description>

         <title>C2&#8208;Cyanomethyl (CNMe) Ether&#8208;Protected Glycosyl Trichloroacetimidate Donors for Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanomethyl (CNMe) ether group has been reported as a stereodirecting C2&#8208;protecting group on glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors. The synthesized donors were activated by TMSOTf catalyst to obtain the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides in excellent stereoselectivities. The stereoselectivity was achieved in the presence of both arming and disarming protections on the donor as well as the acceptor handles. The donors have been extended in the synthesis of saccharides bearing consecutive &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;linkages.







Abstract
Stereoselective construction of glycosidic linkages have emerged as one of the pivotal aspects for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharide assemblies. We herein report C2&#8208;cyanomethyl (CNMe) ether as a strong stereodirecting group on trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides. The developed donors bearing various arming and disarming protections along with C2&#8208;CNMe ether delivered the glycosides in short reaction time, moderate to good yields and high to excellent stereoselectivities. Gluco&#8208; and galacto&#8208; configured donors were found compatible with an array of alcohols having varied reactivities. The orthogonality of the CNMe ether protection with silyl ether group has been further explored for sequential glycosylations.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Curcumins with 3&#8208;Olefinic Oxindoles for the Synthesis of Spirocyclohexanoneoxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;oxindoles containing three contiguous chiral centers were synthesized with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities via cascade double Michael reactions of curcumins with 3&#8208;alkylideneoxindole carboxylates. The selectivities are supported by transitions state energy calculations at B3LYP//6&#8208;31g(d) level of DFT.







Abstract
An enantioselective desymmetrization of curcumins with 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles involving a cascade double&#8208;Michael addition strategy provides direct access to spirocyclohexanone&#8208;oxindoles with complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities, besides good to excellent yields. The products possess three contiguous chiral centers and multiple reactive functionalities. The observed selectivities were rationalized by transitions state energy calculations at B3LYP//6&#8208;31g(d) level of DFT.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced C3&#8208;trifluoroethylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using an inexpensive organic dye as a photocatalyst and commercially available 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodoethane as a trifluoroethyl radical source.

A TiCl4 Lewis acid&#8208;mediated domino semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction&#8208;based approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (+)&#8208;7 and azatricyclic core of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (+)&#8208;8&#8201;a.







Abstract
A concise approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of the azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (8&#8201;a) and (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (8&#8201;b) using stereoselective domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction as a key step. In presence of TiCl4, the oxaspiropentane&#8208;azide derivatives underwent stereoselective domino cyclization to furnish the corresponding angularly fused azatricyclic cores in very good yields. Moreover, azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A has also been realized, in a stepwise manner, through the intramolecular Schmidt reaction of azido&#8208;spirocyclobutanone intermediate. The synthetic utility of domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction is further shown in the diastereoselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (7).

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Promoted Transfer Hydrogenation of Azaaryl Ketones by Using Formate as the Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azaaryl ketones using formate as hydrogen source was developed and a possible reaction mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A novel cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reduction of 2&#8208;pyridyl ketones and related heteroaryl compounds using formate as reductant was developed. Ketone substrate is activated by chelation with cobalt, which makes the present method highly selective. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed.

PIDA/I2&#8208;mediated decarboxylative C4&#8208;amination of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids was achieved via direct Csp2&#8722;H dehydrogenative C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with secondary amines under ambient conditions.







Abstract
An efficient and straightforward protocol for accessing a new series of functionalized 4&#8208;aminocoumarins from PIDA/I2&#8208;mediated decarboxylative C4&#8208;amination of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids via direct Csp2&#8722;H dehydrogenative C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with secondary amines under ambient conditions has been accomplished. The notable advantages of this protocol are the tolerance of diverse functional groups, mild reaction conditions at ambient temperature, moderate to good yields, short reaction times (in minutes), high regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. This is the first report of decarboxylative Csp2&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;N coupling of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids for synthesizing 4&#8208;aminocoumarins.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Transformations: Rapid Access to Amines, Alkyl Halides, and Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a versatile photocatalytic strategy for the decarboxylative transformations of redox&#8208;active esters (RAE) to a variety of alkyl halides, amines, and olefins in the presence of nBu4NI in a single&#8208;step. It is a straightforward method which is applied to the functionalization of a series of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and complex natural products. Mechanistically, a charge transfer complex (CTC) was formed through non&#8208;covalent interaction between RAE and nBu4NI. Upon photoexcitation, the ammonia salt acted as both an efficient electron donor and an iodine source for radical recombination. The mild reaction condition allows this method can be applied for modification of complex natural products and versatile follow&#8208;up transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient photocatalytic strategy for the decarboxylative transformations of redox&#8208;active esters to construct C=C, C(sp3)&#8722;N, and C(sp3)&#8722;X bonds in a single&#8208;step. This operationally simple method provides a straightforward access to a variety of protected alkyl amines, alkyl halides and olefins under mild conditions in the absence of metals and photocatalysts. The method can successfully be applied to primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicate that the charge transfer complex (CTC) was formed by nBu4NI with redox&#8208;active esters, in which the nBu4NI acted as both an iodine source and an efficient electron donor.

         <title>Reactions in Endohedral Functionalized Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds play an increasing role in cage chemistry. Here, the recent developments of reactions that are mediated or catalyzed by such endohedral&#8208;functionalized cages is reviewed. The article is structured according to the role that the endohedral group plays with respect to the reaction mediated or catalyzed.







Abstract
The introduction of enhanced functionalization is a key aspect in the current design of cage chemistry. At the moment, several approaches are intensively investigated. The synthesis of cage compounds that display endohedral functionalization plays a key role among them. Here, the studies of reactions that occur in endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds is reviewed. After an introduction in current trends in cage&#8208;chemistry the discussion of reactions in endohedral&#8208;cage compounds is divided into three sections. These are: 1) Endohedral groups that are by themselves functional, 2) endohedral groups that can bind to a transition&#8208;metal complex and 3) endohedral groups that can bind by themselves to a metal. The article closes with an outlook on additional current developments in the field of endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage&#8208;compounds, which may contribute in the future towards reactivity in cage compounds.

         <title>Pyridine Adducts of Tricyano&#8208; and Dicyanoboranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient syntheses for pyridine and 4&#8208;cyanopyridine adducts of the strong Lewis acids BH(CN)2, B(CN)3, and BF(CN)2 starting from readily available hydridoborates are described. The different Lewis acidities of the three boranes have been assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Becket method and by calculated fluoride ion affinities (FIA). In addition, the electrochemical properties of the borane adducts have been studied by cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Cyanoborane adducts of the Lewis acids B(CN)3, BF(CN)2, and BH(CN)2 with pyridine and 4&#8208;cyanopyridine have been obtained in high yields. The syntheses were accomplished by oxidation of the readily available potassium salts of the cyano(hydrido)borate anions [BH(CN)3]&#8722; (MHB), [BFH(CN)2]&#8722; (FHB), and [BH2(CN)2]&#8722; (DHB) with bromine in the presence of the respective pyridine derivative C5H5N or 4&#8208;CN&#8208;C5H4N as starting material. All six cyanoborane adducts have been characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The reduction of the cyanoborane adducts has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and the Lewis acidity of the different cyanoboranes has been assessed using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. Selected experimental data and trends are compared to theoretical ones, for example fluoride ion affinities (FIAs).

         <title>Oxovanadium(V)&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling Reaction of Alcohols with Trimethylsilyl Enol Ethers in the Presence of MS3A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deoxygenative coupling reaction of allyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers was performed by using a commercially available oxovanadium(V) catalyst, providing &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one&#8208;step. This catalytic system could be applied to a gram&#8208;scale catalytic synthesis of the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound and the deoxygenative coupling reaction of benzyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers.







Abstract
Oxovanadium(V)&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling reaction of allyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers was demonstrated to afford &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one&#8208;step. The catalytic deoxygenative coupling reaction of allyl alcohols proceeded smoothly with both aromatic and aliphatic trimethylsilyl enol ethers. This catalytic deoxygenative coupling system could be applied to the deoxygenative coupling reaction of benzyl alcohols with trimethylsilyl enol ethers, providing the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale catalytic synthesis of the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound was successfully performed to validate the scalability of this catalytic deoxygenative coupling reaction.

         <title>KI&#8208;Mediated Chlorine Gas&#8208;Free Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient KI&#8208;mediated chloro&#8208;oxidation of indoles was developed, using KCl/NaCl as the chlorine source and oxone as oxidant, which affording various functionalized 3,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles in moderate to excellent yields. This chlorine gas&#8208;free protocol provided a practical approach for the synthesis of a series of 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
An efficient and environmentally friendly methodology for 3,3&#8208;dichlorination and 2&#8208;oxidation of indole derivatives is described. Using KI as promotor, MCl (M=K, Na) as chlorine source, and oxone as oxidant, the reaction proceeds smoothly affording various functionalized 3,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles in moderate to excellent yields. This strategy can also be extended to 3&#8208;substituted indoles. With a broad substrate scope, it is a practical approach to 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An eight&#8208;steps linear sequence for the preparation of two diastereomers of an 8&#8208;fluoro&#8208;ABC&#8208;steroid building block was developed. Key step was an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of an intermediate o&#8208;quinodimethane formed from a benzocyclobutene substituted with a 5&#8208;fluorohex&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;one chain. This side chain was prepared from 6&#8208;chlorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene by bromofluorination, elimination of HBr, Finkelstein reaction and alkylation of a literature&#8208;known benzocyclobutene derivative with the thus&#8208;formed 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene. Allylic oxidation of side chain&#8217;s fluorovinyl moiety to an &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone completed the preparation of the precursor for the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition.</dc:description>

This side chain was prepared from 6-chlorohex-1-ene by bromofluorination, elimination of HBr, Finkelstein reaction and alkylation of a literature-known benzocyclobutene derivative with the thus-formed 6-iodo-2-fluorohex-1-ene. Allylic oxidation of side chain&#8217;s fluorovinyl moiety to an &#945;-fluoro-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone completed the preparation of the precursor for the [4+2]-cycloaddition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoacidity of Indolinospirobenzopyrans in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolinospirobenzopyrans in their open protonated form constitute the archetype of &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221;, as they can release protons persistently and reversibly following visible light absorption. In this Review, we survey their wide&#8208;spread applicability by contextualizing the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release in water.







Abstract
The reversible isomerism of indolinospirobenzopyrans is perhaps among the most studied phenomena in the field of molecular switches. Although they began to gain attention as early as 70&#8197;years ago following the seminal work of Hirshberg and Fischer, who were the first to recognize their photochromic behaviours, their implementation as photoacids emerged prominently only in the last decade. In this Review, we contextualize the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release that occurs in these molecular switches, highlighting the most recent advances in their characterization and application as &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221; in water.

         <title>Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Reductive Cleavage of an Oxygen&#8208;Containing Naphthyl Macrocycle</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthyl&#8208;ether based macrocycle suffers multiple C&#8722;O cleavages under chemical reduction. The structures of the macrocycle and the resulting negatively charged fragment are analyzed in detail including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.







Abstract
A small macrocycle comprising ether&#8208;bridged naphthyl units was prepared in a two&#8208;step synthesis. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of two polymorphs are reported, one of which showed multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;naphthyl interactions of a solvent molecule in the cavity of the macrocycle. Chemical reduction led to C&#8722;O bond cleavages accompanied by a Z/E isomerization. The resulting twofold negatively charged (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;naphthyl)ethylene fragment was isolated as its potassium salts. Electronic characterization revealed a singlet ground state, and a marked distortion of the central ethylene unit was observed upon electron uptake.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of [b]&#8208;Annulated Azepane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters are submitted to olefin cross metathesis and subsequent exhaustive hydrogenation and reductive amination to furnish [b]&#8208;annulated azepane derivatives.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;, benzo&#8208;, and cyclohepta[b]&#8208;annulated azepane scaffolds were prepared in two steps from optically active cyclic &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters. The first step was ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed olefin cross metathesis with acrylonitrile. The second step was palladium&#8208;catalyzed dihydrogenation which consists of three consecutive processes: The hydrogenation of the C&#8722;C double and C&#8722;N triple bonds was followed by the reductive amination via the iminium ion formed in situ from the primary amino function and the endocyclic carbonyl group. This last step gave, stereoselectively, the annulated azepanes with relative trans&#8208;configuration. The amino function and the ester group define two points for further diversification of the scaffolds. The trifluoroacetyl derivatives allowed to establish the enantiopurity of the products to be 97&#8211;98&#8201;% ee by GLC on a chiral phase. The relative trans&#8208;configurations and in one case also the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration was established by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Acidic DESs as Active Media for a Sustainable Synthesis of Biindoles Starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Diaminotolanes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an alternative and more sustainable method for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted 3,3&#8242;&#8209;biindoles starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diaminotolanes and (hetero)arylaldehydes. The key feature of the approach is the use of an acidic DES able to exploit a double activity, i.e. solvent and BA catalyst, avoiding the use of VOCs as solvents and additional acid catalysts. By this way, we synthesized twenty&#8208;five biindoles, including eighteen new compounds. The reactions run quickly under mild conditions by microwave heating at 70 &#176;C, with yields ranging from good to very good. The reaction scope is rather broad. The medium demonstrated to be reusable at least five times with only a slight reduction in yields. Based on experimental evidence and previous literature findings, a plausible mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Amine Catalyzed Reductive Aldol/Reductive Michael Addition Cascade Towards Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzannulated Diquinanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amine catalyzed intramolecular reductive Michael addition cascade to a keto&#8208;bis&#8208;enone is reported. Enantio&#8208; (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and diastereoselective benzannulated diquinanes were obtained with three consecutive stereocenters, includes an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Interestingly, reactivity switching was observed on changing a tether connecting the ketone and an enone moiety.







Abstract
Disclosed here an amine&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol&#8208;condensation followed by an intramolecular reductive Michael&#8208;addition cascade employing Hantzsch ester as hydride source to a keto&#8208;bis&#8208;enone to provide enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective benzannulated diquinanes having three consecutive stereocenters, one of which is an all&#8208;carbon quaternary formyl stereocenter. Interestingly, on changing a tether connecting the ketone and an enone moiety from an aliphatic to an aromatic, a change in reactivity is observed. In this case, instead of the above&#8208;mentioned reductive aldol condensation, an asymmetric aldol reaction occurs, followed by an iminium/enamine isomerization and, finally diastereoselective Michael addition reaction occurs. As a result, a bis&#8208;benzannulated diquinane is obtained with vicinal congested quaternary chiral centers.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosed here an amine-catalyzed reductive aldol-condensation followed by an intramolecular reductive Michael-addition cascade employing Hantzsch ester as hydride source to a keto-bis-enone to provide enantio- and diastereoselective benzannulated diquinanes having three consecutive stereocenters, one of which is an all-carbon quaternary formyl stereocenter. Interestingly, on changing a tether connecting the ketone and an enone moiety from an aliphatic to an aromatic, a change in reactivity is observed. In this case, instead of the above-mentioned reductive aldol condensation, an asymmetric aldol reaction occurs, followed by an iminium/enamine isomerization and, finally diastereoselective Michael addition reaction occurs. As a result, a bis-benzannulated diquinane is obtained with vicinal congested quaternary chiral centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical borylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and allenoates is described. In an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, a panel of Michael acceptors and allenoates was readily reacted. The reaction was efficient and the products were obtained in good to excellent yields (20&#8197;examples, 47&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% yield), offering an access to versatile borylated building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis of Phosphate Esters by Using Diphenyl Ditelluride as Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an approach to prepare phosphate esters by a dehydrogenative phosphorylation reaction between functionalized naphthols and H&#8208;phosphonates using diphenyl ditelluride as an organocatalyst and sonochemistry as an alternative energy source. The method was also suitable to the use &#945;&#8208;naphthol, &#946;&#8208;naphthol, phenol and thiophenol.







Abstract
We report a protocol for the synthesis of new dialkyl(1&#8208;(organolthio)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphates and derivatives via a dehydrogenative phosphorylation reaction between functionalized naphthols and H&#8208;phosphonates. Diphenyl ditelluride was employed as an organocatalyst and sonochemistry as an alternative energy source. The reaction conditions were defined through a factorial design approach, and the best condition provided the synthesis of dialkyl(1&#8208;(organolthio)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphates in yields that varied from 51&#8211;98&#8201;% under ultrasound irradiation after 2&#8197;h of sonication. The synthetic protocol was also effective for phenol and thiophenol starting materials. All products were characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques.

         <title>Regioselective Alkynylation of Allylic Phosphates with Alkynyl Copper Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a regioselective alkynylation of allylic phosphates with alkynyl copper reagents. The reaction gave 1,4&#8208;enynes independent of steric hindrance or electronic effects of the substrate or nucleophile. Then, we efficiently synthesized intermediates in the synthesis of lipid metabolites using this reaction.







Abstract
We developed an alkynylation of allylic phosphates with acetylenes in the presence of copper and magnesium salts. The reaction proceeded regioselectively to afford the corresponding 1,4&#8208;enynes. Furthermore, the functional group tolerance of this reaction was established. As an application, the 1,4&#8208;enyne intermediate involved in the synthesis of 13R,19S,20S&#8208;trihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid could be efficiently synthesized.

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent 2&#8208;Aminopurine Derivatives: synthesis, photophysical characterization, and preliminary cytotoxicity evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) are emerging as extraordinarily useful tools for DNA labelling technologies. The highly fluorescent adenine analogue 2&#8209;aminopurine (2AP) is still the most used within the few hundreds of newly FBAs synthesized, but its excitation in the UV region demands for high energy sources endangering living cells. New and highly fluorescent 2AP derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines, were obtained using novel, simpler, but very efficient synthesis method. All the new compounds exhibit advantageous photophysical properties over 2AP, showing absorption and emission bands ranging the visible region (blue&#8208;green region), high fluorescence quantum yields and Stokes shifts, especially in non&#8208;protic organic solvents. Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT) of electronic and vibrational structure were performed, allowing to predict absorption and emission spectra in accordance with experimental data. The extensive solvatochromism of compounds gives them important microenvironmental sensitivity to be used as superior fluorescent probes, comparing to 2AP. In addition, these newly synthesized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines exhibit little to no toxicity in assays using yeast cells, making them also valuable candidates for fluorescent studies in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Oxidation of Organo&#8208;Boron Compounds Using Electrochemically Generated Peroxodicarbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxodicarbonate represents a green and largely underexplored oxidizer generated electrochemically from aqueous carbonate solutions. Through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzer technology, highly concentrated solutions have now become accessible. These were successfully employed as green oxidizer in deborolative hydroxylations. A plethora of phenols and alcohols have thus been synthesized in up to 99% from organoboron compounds using only green and non&#8208;toxic solvents This transformation was successfully scaled&#8208;up to multi&#8208;gram batch sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Oxidation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;Protected Diarylhydrazines to Diaryldiazenes with (Diacetoxyiodo)benzene under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, rapid one&#8208;step oxidation of shelf&#8208;stable N&#8208;Boc&#8208; and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;Boc&#8208;diarylhydrazines with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene provides unsymmetrical diaryldiazenes, arylazopyridines and tris(arylazo)benzenes in good to excellent yields. The method allows fast and selective access to variously substituted di(hetero)aryldiazenes.







Abstract
A study on the oxidation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208; and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected 1,2&#8208;diarylhydrazines with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene is reported. The reactions proceed quickly in acetic acid at slightly elevated temperatures, giving diaryldiazenes in good to excellent yields. Electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are well tolerated. This synthetic protocol also applies to synthesising (aryldiazenyl)pyridines and unsymmetrical 1,3,5&#8208;tris(arylazo)benzenes.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Compounds for the Synthesis of Amines: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In synthetic chemistry and pharmacy, the reductive amination reaction is crucial because it is one of the most effective methods for forming C&#8722;N bonds. Reductive amination is a reaction that occurs when an amine or ammonia is combined with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of a reducing agent and a catalyst. For these reactions to access different amines, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been successfully developed. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Reductive amination is a valuable method for amine synthesis that has been the topic of a century&#8216;s worth of in&#8208;depth study in both academia and industry. Amines and their derivatives serve as incredibly adaptable building blocks for a broad array of organic substrates and are significant precursors for a myriad of advanced chemicals, physiologically active compounds, agrochemicals, biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. The creation of innovative catalytic processes for the long&#8208;term and selective synthesis of amines from readily accessible and environmentally benign reagents remains a top priority in chemical research. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been designed with success to enable these reactions to explore new amines. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency. This review comprehensively overviews the Ru&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination processes and includes the literature from 2009 to 2022.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Pyridine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Molecules: Recent Strategies and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

Mind the gap! A practical guide to navigate through the complex network of selective late&#8208;stage functionalisations of pyridine&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation (LSF) is an innovative technique that has been successfully applied to the C&#8722;H diversification of pharmaceuticals. However, LSF of the pyridine ring in drug&#8208;like molecules is often unselective. As a result, a mixture of structurally related products is obtained, thus making the purification tedious and time&#8208;consuming. This review shines a light on recent strategies addressing the selectivity issue in the LSF of complex natural products or drugs containing the pyridine moiety. Specifically, we have reviewed the efforts reported both in academia and industries with the hope of providing a guide for the LSF of elaborated pyridines.

Ammonium acetate in ethanol is a clean and efficient protocol for the multicomponent construction of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines, being an appropriately mild catalyst in the case of the acid&#8208;sensitive biobased platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF). The protocol is tolerant to many functional groups in substituted diamines, alkynones or alkyl alkynoates, and furanic aldehydes.







Abstract
The use of the renewable platform molecule 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) in multi&#8208;component reaction with a diamine and an alkynone to generate seven&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines is described. Due to the sensitivity of 5&#8208;HMF to strong acidic and basic conditions, the investigation required an in&#8208;depth revisit of reaction parameters as compared to benchmark aldehydes. Among catalysts/solvents couples, ammonium acetate in ethanol proved to be a clean and efficient system. These optimized conditions were subsequently used to investigate the scope of the reaction providing a library of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in moderate to good yields from a wide range of diversely substituted diamines and alkynones or alkyl alkynoates.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approaches Employing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines, having diverse reactivity profile, have been exploited as versatile reaction partners in synthetic organic chemistry. This review comprehensively highlights the advancement made in asymmetric catalysis employing various chemically and structurally distinct conjugated imines/azadienes.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds have consistently been a noticeable center of attention due to their significant utilization in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines or conjugated imines provide a lot of significant cyclic as well as acyclic products through reacting with a versatile family of compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in enantioselective reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines by using synthetic methodologies for synthesizing various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that contain four to six&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of rarely found seven&#8208;, eight&#8208; and nine&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles have also been reported.

         <title>Co(Salox)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily accessible Salox ligands in combination with cobalt were found to be competent catalysts for the asymmetric conjugate reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, and nitriles with NaBH4 To give enantioselectivity up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er and quantitative yields. Preliminary experiments highlight a relatively complex reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Co&#8208;Salox complexes are suitable catalysts for the reduction of prochiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. These ligands can be prepared in a single step from available and inexpensive materials, thus representing an easily accessible alternative to previously reported Co&#8208;catalysts. NaBH4 is employed as reducing agent in the presence of EtOH as proton source, leading to the stereoselective formation of chiral esters, amides, and nitriles in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er. The concentration of the reductant counter cation (Na+) and the solvent polarity have been shown to correlate with reactivity and enantioselectivity, suggesting that a relatively complex mechanistic manifold is in place.

         <title>Towards Green Reductions in Bio&#8208;Derived Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of unsaturated compounds is a powerful tool employed in almost all multistep syntheses. The present Review highlights the recent developments achieved in the field of sustainable reductions of organic compounds in green media: from the traditional direct hydrogenation with heterogenous metal&#8208;catalysts to the transfer hydrogenation strategy all methodologies reported have been performed in bio&#8208;solvents that can be derived from renewable natural sources.







Abstract
The hydrogenation processes, and all the reactions that formally add two hydrogen atoms to an unsaturated bond, are among the most used transformations in the manufacture of bulk and fine chemicals. Although their potential as powerful tool for the sustainable synthesis of organic compounds, hydrogenations, and more generally the reductions, have been typically carried out in volatile organic solvents deriving from petroleum; indeed, all studies and fascinating advances related to the catalysts&#8217; activity or the reducing agents&#8217; reactivity have been limited to such volatile and often toxic reaction media. In this review, recent advances in the reducing methodologies with an improved degree of sustainability have been described. In particular, a series of examples have been reported to highlight the chance to reduce an organic compound by using a benign solvent deriving from renewable sources, without waiving to the process efficiency and selectivity. Some important key points of green chemistry, such as the easiness of catalyst recovery or the simplicity of product isolation, have been considered in the choice of the described studies.

         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified by a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses and Preliminary Biological Evaluations of the Dibromopyrrole&#8208;Containing Marine Natural Products Agesasine A, Agesasine B, Longamide E and Various Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of the title marine natural products have been achieved and so confirming the structures originally assigned to them. Upon subjecting agesasine A and its corresponding ethyl ester to Mitsunobu conditions a 1,5&#8208;cyclodehydration reaction takes place to give 2&#8208;oxazolines. In contrast, on subjecting agesasine B to the same Mitsunobu conditions then a simple dehydration reaction occurs to give the corresponding acrylate. A total synthesis of longamide E was achieved by engaging a 1,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrole in a lactam&#8208;forming reaction and this was followed by a two&#8208;fold and fully regio&#8208;controlled bromination reaction. A distinctly different and possibly biomimetic route was used to synthesize, via the open&#8208;chain natural product nakamurine B, longamide B and its methyl ester. Preliminary biological evaluations of the title alkaloids and various analogues against a small human cancer cell line panel reveals cytotoxic properties that vary significantly with structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Studies of Thermoresponsive Copper (I) Complex towards Click Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ensure the easy removal of Copper catalyst after click reaction, a thermoresponsive polymer (PNIPAM) is incorporated. As a result, through the volume phase transition behavior of PNIPAM, the catalyst can easily be removed from the system by simply heating.







Abstract
Click reaction or copper&#8208;assisted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can conveniently synthesize desired organic molecules or functionalize biological macromolecules. In many cases, trace amounts of residual copper from the reaction mixture are not trivial to remove when the exhaustive purification step is avoided to fulfill the essential criteria of a click reaction. It is often detrimental, particularly for biochemical applications or when it involves biological macromolecules. Herein, we have reported the synthesis of a new type of copper (I) complex as a smart catalyst for click reaction, which can be separated from the reaction mixture very easily by the slight elevation of temperature, thanks to its thermoresponsive behavior. The click reactions using a thermoresponsive catalyst were first studied in an aqueous medium using various organic molecules containing alkyne and azide functional groups. Later, the strategy was extended to biological macromolecules like collagen.

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;4 picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.







Abstract
The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable cis&#8208;&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;4 configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a regioselective cross-dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2-aryl-N-heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine-borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for the synthesis of 2-aryl-N-heterocyclic dimers via a cross-dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo-CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine-borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
