COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

Two optimized synthetic pathways for the manufacturing of 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;amine (PicADNP) are described. The material was fully characterized, and its crystal structure could be elucidated. Hirshfeld surface and 2D fingerprint plot analysis were performed to assess the sensitivity towards external stimuli. Various energetic properties were calculated and compared to the results of sensitivity measurements, SSRT testing and booster testing.







Abstract
Two improved, fast, feasible, scalable, and economic synthetic protocols for the laboratory scale manufacturing of 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;amine (PicADNP) are described. The previous set of analytical data from an earlier publication could be verified and complemented by additional measurements. The material was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis, DSC and DTA, as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. The crystal structure was elucidated and Hirshfeld surface analysis, as well as 2D fingerprint plot analysis for the assessment of sensitivities towards external stimuli was applied. The sensitivity towards shock, friction and electrostatic discharge was also determined experimentally. The performance of the title compound was calculated by applying the EXPLO5 computer code and the theoretical results were compared with the results of SSRT and booster testing experiments. The title compound combines good energetic properties with improved safety characteristics and could find its way into application as a new booster explosive to replace the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material PETN. The optimizations of the synthetic protocol comprise a greener solvent system, shorter reaction times, higher yields for the pure material and a nontoxic byproduct to make the manufacturing process more attractive and better suitable for a subsequent scale up to the technical and industrial scale.

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects despite evidence for catalyst aggregation.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt  2  to benzaldehyde with (1  R  ,2  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs catalyst loading and NMR investigations (  1  H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the  absence  of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>2&#8208;(8&#8208;Iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxide: Suppressed Reactivity of Iodine Atom and Unusual Temperature Dynamics of the EPR Spectrum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;coupling of 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene with an organogold nitronyl nitroxide stops at the monoradical with iodine atom at the peri&#8208;position toward the paramagnetic moiety. This arrangement causes a strong distortion of the nitroxide geometry and unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. The latter can be explained by assuming different characteristic temperatures for averaging the anisotropy of the HFC tensors for N and I atoms.







Abstract
While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet's geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify these dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable aiso(127I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with J=8 and 14&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;2&#8197;J&#8901;S1S2).

&lt;p&gt;The cross&#8208;coupling of 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene with an organogold nitronyl nitroxide stops at the monoradical with iodine atom at the peri&#8208;position toward the paramagnetic moiety. This arrangement causes a strong distortion of the nitroxide geometry and unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. The latter can be explained by assuming different characteristic temperatures for averaging the anisotropy of the HFC tensors for N and I atoms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet's geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify these dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;iso&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;=8 and 14&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;H=&#8722;2&#8197;J&#8901;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Ozanimod, the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient of a New Drug for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 12, Page 1924-1930, March 26, 2021. </description>

Enantioselective imine reduction or reductive amination using Wills&#8217; ruthenium diamine tethered chiral catalyst as C3&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;teth&#8208;MtsDPEN RuCl gave a new short and efficient synthesis of ozanimod. HCOOH/Et3N provided hydride source in this powerful asymmetric hydrogen transfer.







Abstract
We report here a short enantioselective synthesis of Ozanimod, a potent modulator of the enzyme Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate receptor (S1PR), recently approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of relapsing&#8208;remitting multiple sclerosis. Amongst different synthetic approaches explored, we achieved the best result introducing the stereogenic centre in the last step through imine asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) using Wills&#8217; catalysts. Besides the reduced numbers of enantiomeric purity controls required, this process culminates in an exceptionally high enantioselective reductive amination obtained with commercially available tethered Ru catalysts. Starting from commercially available 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;indanone, enantiomerically pure Ozanimod was obtained in 5&#8197;steps in 62&#8201;% overall yield and 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Prolinol as a Chiral Auxiliary in Organophosphorus Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 12, Page 1931-1941, March 26, 2021. </description>

Several Prolinol based phosphine boranes were synthesized. Their chemical behavior towards organometallic reagents was tested as a first step of transformation towards chiral phosphines. P(III)&#8208;coordinated amide esters were tested as ligands in Iridium catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
Several strategies for the development of the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral organophosphorus compounds with (L)&#8208;prolinol as a source of chirality have been examined. A reaction of L&#8208;prolinol with a set of different alkyl/arylphosphonous acid diamides led in most of the cases to the quantitative formation of the appropriate bicyclic oxazaphospholidines with complete diastereo and enantioselectivity. The latter were reacted with BH3 complex and the formed borane analogues were submitted to structural modifications leading to tertiary phosphine&#8208;boranes. Additionally, the effectiveness of oxazaphospholidines as ligands in transition metal asymmetric catalysis has been tested in hydrogenation of dehydroaminoacid esters and imine.

         <title>Synthesis, cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal evaluation of ent&#8208;beyerene and ent&#8208;kaurene derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease endemic of tropical and subtropical countries. Current pharmacologic treatments have serious drawbacks. For these reasons, we need new and improved medical treatments. On the other side, natural products have been a valuable source of bioactive molecules, but unlike other products of natural origin, diterpenoids are molecules with only a few studies as antiparasitic drugs. Continuing our work on syntheses of beyerenes, and focusing on obtaining more compounds with antiparasitic activity, we describe in this work the syntheses and activity of several  ent  &#8208;beyerene and  ent  &#8208;kaurene type of compounds against CL, and also their toxicity. Utilizing classical reactions such as Grignard, Mitsunobu and Williamson, among others, it was possible to modify rings A and D of  ent  &#8208;beyerenes, specifically C&#8208;19 on ring A, and C&#8208;15 and C&#8208;16 on ring D. A total of 40 new compounds were obtained, 21 of them being active against  Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis  with median effective concentration (EC  50  ) values less than 25.0 mg/mL and of these with EC  50  values ranging from 1.8 to 7.1 mg/mL and Selectivity Index (SI) varying from 1.1 to 5.1. All compounds showed to be highly cytotoxic at concentrations less than 100 mg/mL, except compound  37  that was cytotoxic at 279.7 mg/mL and moderately active against  L. braziliensis  (EC  50  = 33.5 mg/mL and an SI of 8.4.

         <title>A New Approach for the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkanesulfenic Acids</title>

A new and more practical method for the preparation of solution&#8208;stable perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids was developed. A series of perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids were synthesized in good yields by the &#946;&#8208;H elimination reaction of corresponding sulfoxides.







Abstract
A new and more practical method for the preparation of solution&#8208;stable perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids was successfully developed. Starting from perfluoroalkyl iodides, perfluoroalkyl sulfoxides were synthesized by their substitution reaction with alkyl mercaptans and the following oxidation of resulting perfluoroalkyl sulfides with m&#8208;CPBA. Subsequent &#946;&#8208;H elimination of perfluoroalkyl sulfoxides under heating conditions gave the corresponding perfluoroalkanesulfenic acids in good yields.

         <title>Oxoammonium&#8208;Mediated Allylsilane&#8211;Ether Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxoammonium&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C(sp3) allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl ethers using allylsilanes as nucleophilic partners is disclosed. This new C&#8722;C bond forming C&#8722;H activation process allows to obtain the corresponding coupled products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A new C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reaction consisting of the oxidative &#945;&#8208;allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl&#8208; methyl ethers has been developed. The C&#8722;C coupling could be carried out under mild conditions thanks to the use of cheap and green oxoammonium salts. The scope of the reaction was studied over 27 examples, considering the nature of the substituents on the two coupling partners.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinylnaphthofurans and NMR Analysis of their Photoswitching</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy synthesis of photochromic vinylnaphthofurans by the acid&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of naphthols with but&#8208;2&#8208;yne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diols is described. These polyaromatic compounds switch between uncolored (Vis) and colored (UV) states at room temperature. NMR analysis of irradiated solutions allowed to identify the photoisomers and some side&#8208;products.

         <title>Luminescent Ionic Liquid Crystals Based on Naphthalene&#8208;Imidazolium Unit</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of fields of ionic liquid crystal chemistry, those of imidazolium salts, luminescence and liquid crystals, could lead to a wide range of new materials with original supramolecular properties. An efficient three&#8208;step synthetic method is developed in order to obtain luminescent naphthalene&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;anion compounds in the three states of matter: solid, liquid crystal, and liquid.







Abstract
In this article, we describe an efficient synthetic pathway and the characterization of liquid crystal luminescent imidazolium salts based on a naphthalene unit. The luminescent imidazolium&#8208;naphthalene rigid part is decorated with a benzyl group functionalized by two or three dodecyloxy chains. A crystalline structure shows unambiguously the segregation between the rigid ionic and flexible parts conducive to the emergence of mesomorphic properties. A complete thermotropic properties study of these salts has been carried out according to different anions. The alkyl tail number variation and therefore the amphipathic character (balance between hydrophilic/hydrophobic) makes it possible to induce liquid crystal state with different architectures of self&#8208;organization in layers (Smectic A) or columns (Columnar hexagonal). Finally, the photophysical properties were measured in solution and in the solid state at room temperature and showed photoluminescence quantum yields around 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 12, Page 1776-1808, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions are very attractive for organic synthesis due to favorable properties of copper such as high relative abundance, low toxicity, low cost, eco&#8208;friendliness, as well as its sustainable and versatile nature. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds such as N&#8208;heterocycles, amines, imines, amides, and alkynes using copper catalysts.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions have received wide attention due to the high relative abundance of copper, its cheap price, low toxicity, eco&#8208;friendliness, sustainable nature, and versatility as a catalyst. Copper catalysts are widely used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling and have found wide applications in heterocyclic chemistry. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of biologically important compounds such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines, amides, imines, and alkynes using copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling and covers literature from 2018 to 2020.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of &#8216;Picket Fence&#8217; Porphyrins Based on Nonplanar Macrocycles**

Nonplanar picket&#8208;fence porphyrins: Two sterically demanding systems, heavy beta substitution and pivalate groups, meet as an intrinsic supramolecular design on a porphyrin scaffold. The symmetrical, double&#8208;sided, and unsymmetrical porphyrins were synthesized and analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, highlighting the combined benefits of steric interplay in designing supramolecular ensembles.







Abstract
Traditional &#8216;picket fence&#8217; porphyrin systems have been a topic of interest for their capacity to direct steric shielding effects selectively to one side of the macrocycle. Sterically overcrowded porphyrin systems that adopt macrocycle deformations have recently drawn attention for their applications in organocatalysis and sensing. Here we explore the combined benefits of nonplanar porphyrins and the old molecular design to bring new concepts to the playing field. The challenging ortho&#8208;positions of meso&#8208;phenyl residues in dodecasubstituted porphyrin systems led us to transition to less hindered para&#8208; and meta&#8208;sites and develop selective demethylation based on the steric interplay. Isolation of the symmetrical target compound [2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethyl&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dipivaloyloxyphenyl)porphyrin] was investigated under two synthetic pathways. The obtained insight was used to isolate unsymmetrical [2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethyl&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;nitro&#8208;5&#8208;pivaloyloxyphenyl)porphyrin]. Upon separation of the atropisomers, a detailed single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis highlighted intrinsic intermolecular interactions. The nonplanarity of these systems in combination with &#8216;picket fence&#8217; motifs provides an important feature in the design of supramolecular ensembles.

Diaryliodonium salts have been extensively studied as coupling partners in directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H arylations to obtain aryl/biaryl derivatives. This Minireview summarizes all such developments to provide an overview to the scientific community for further advancements in this area.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Cross&#8208;coupling via directing group assisted C&#8722;H bond activation has become an expedient tool in current synthesis to achieve diverse molecular complexity. In this context, chelation&#8208;assisted arylations of C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bonds have been extensively investigated as aryl/biaryl derivatives are an important contributor in the area of the industry, farming, medicinal and material science. The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini&#8208;review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.

         <title>The Asymmetric Difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction</title>

Convenient, versatile, reliable, and functional&#8208;group tolerant: The Reformatsky reaction! Over 130&#8197;years old, it is still a good choice when synthesis requires the introduction of the difluoroacetate enolate into aldehydes and imines. Appropriately chosen chiral substrates, auxiliaries, or additives enable the creation of the new stereogenic center and make asymmetric syntheses of difluorinated biologically active targets accessible.







Abstract
The structural motif of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;substituted carboxyl and carbonyl groups with hydroxy&#8208; or amino&#8208;substituents at the stereogenic carbon in &#946;&#8208;position is found frequently in drugs and biologically active compounds. A straightforward method for obtaining those targets in high enantiomeric purity is given by asymmetric difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky and imino&#8208;difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky reactions that lead to &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylates or &#946;&#8208;lactams. Three concepts that open a route to this type of compounds are discussed here. Firstly, chiral substrates are able to induce stereoselectivity in the formation of the newly created stereogenic center. Secondly, covalently bound and removable chiral auxiliaries are used in asymmetric syntheses and, thirdly, chiral additives and ligands at the metal direct the addition of the zinc enolate, the Reformatsky reagent, to aldehydes or imines in an enantioselective manner. The review closes with a short discussion of more recently developed difluoro&#8208;aldol reactions that may be considered as alternatives to the Reformatsky procedure.

Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives are important dyes with a variety of applications including functionalized materials, biology, medicine, and organic chemistry. This review covers important developments in the use of Bodipy dyes in synthetic photochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a tremendous research field offering many synthetic possibilities to chemists. Breakthroughs in this area have been notably driven by the implementation of new classes of photocatalysts. Within this context, Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) dyes possess attractive chemical and physical features such as their modularity, strong absorption under visible light irradiation, good thermal and photochemical stabilities, and high fluorescence quantum yields. As such, this class of compounds has found widespread applications in functionalized materials, biology, medicine, or organic chemistry. From an organic&#8208;synthetic point of view, excited states of Bodipy dyes have been harnessed in electron and energy transfer reactions. This minireview collates the relevant literature on the applications of these catalysts in synthetic photochemistry and provides some perspectives of this research area.

[Ni(bipy)(bcp)], [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6, and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF6 (bcp=1, dcpa=2) could be structurally characterized and the kinetics of the formation of the nickel complexes from [Ni(bipy)(COD)] were analyzed. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and a comparison to related transition metal complexes are presented.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reactions between [Ni(bipy)(COD)] and bicyclopropylidene (bcp), dicyclopropylacetylene (dcpa) and 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;butyne (dmbu) were investigated using stopped&#8208;flow techniques. Similar to previous studies the results support an associative mechanism (activation parameters for bcp: &#916;H#=46&#177;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S#=&#8722;69&#177;8 J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and therefore allowed to postulate a more general reaction mechanism for the reaction pathway. The products, the nickel(0) complexes [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] and [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], could be structurally characterized and the molecular structures are presented. In addition, the corresponding copper(I) complexes [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6 and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF6 were also structurally characterized and their reactivity towards dioxygen was investigated. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and comparisons to similar literature&#8208;known olefinic complexes with transition metals are presented.

&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;=46&#177;2&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;69&#177;8 J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and therefore allowed to postulate a more general reaction mechanism for the reaction pathway. The products, the nickel(0) complexes [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] and [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], could be structurally characterized and the molecular structures are presented. In addition, the corresponding copper(I) complexes [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were also structurally characterized and their reactivity towards dioxygen was investigated. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and comparisons to similar literature&#8208;known olefinic complexes with transition metals are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cover Feature shows the alkene Bicyclopropylidene (bcp) that became (as well as its derivatives) a versatile C6 building blocks for organic synthesis. It can undergo co&#8208;cyclizations under palladium, nickel, and cobalt catalysis. However, despite the fundamental interest in the mechanism of these reactions, so far only a small number of transition metal complexes with bcp as ligand have been isolated and structurally characterized. Herein, we report the molecular structures of the nickel and copper complexes &#8211; [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6 (anion not shown) &#8211; with bcp and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a co&#8208;ligand.

We report an efficient protocol for the difluoroalkylation&#8208;thiolation of alkenes catalyzed by Cu/Na2S2O5 system with disulfides as a sulfur source. This reaction allows a variety of alkenes and disulfides, wherein the new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds were simultaneously constructed.







Abstract
A novel and convenient protocol for the difluoroalkylation&#8208;thiolation of alkenes catalyzed by Cu/Na2S2O5 system has been developed. This reaction was carried out using readily available starting materials under mild conditions, wherein the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds simultaneously were constructed smoothly. The reaction features broad substrate scope of alkenes and disulfides, good functional group tolerance, and good to excellent yields with high selectivity.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Guaianolide Analogs with Enhanced Antiproliferative Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 12, Page 1859-1863, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular nitrene transfers to naturally&#8208;occurring guaianolide compounds led to isolating nine new derivatives that possess an amino functional group at C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;10, C&#8208;11, and/or C&#8208;13 positions. The relevance of a late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H amination strategy in medicinal chemistry is demonstrated by the improved antiproliferative activity of the C&#8208;2 aminated analogs of guaianolide products.







Abstract
A set of new guaianolide derivatives (1&#8211;9) was obtained from ludartin, achalensolide, and 11,13&#8208;dihydroachalensolide by application of catalytic nitrene transfer reactions. Intermolecular nitrene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertions led to the amination of C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, and C&#8208;10 positions, while alkene aziridination was also observed under these reaction conditions. The antiproliferative activity of natural compounds and their derivatives was evaluated against a panel of human solid tumor cell lines. The results show that an increase in the biological activity was observed following amination at the C&#8208;2 position of Ludartin, thereby demonstrating the interest in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H amination to improve the bioactivity of natural products.

         <title>Debenzylative Sulfonylation of Tertiary Benzylamines Promoted by Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 12, Page 1896-1900, March 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photocatalytic debenzylative sulfonylation of tertiary benzylamines is described, affording a series of sulfonamides in high yields. This operationally simple transformation showed high functional group compatibility and wide substrate scope.







Abstract
An efficient, general, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly photosynthesis of sulfonamides via visible light promoted debenzylative sulfonylation of tertiary benzylamines is described. Compared to the traditional S&#8722;N coupling reactions, which are promoted by oxidative C&#8722;N bond cleavage of symmetrical tertiary alkylamines, this strategy provides a selective C&#8722;N bond cleavage protocol and avoids the use of transition&#8208;metal, explosive oxidants, and ligands.

The mechanism and the origin of the regioselectivity of the rhodium/diene&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of C1&#8208;substituted oxabenzonorbornadienes with arylboronic acids has been examined by M06/Def2TZVP using density functional theory (DFT). The overall mechanism for the reaction is considered as a four&#8208;step reaction including transmetalation, carborhodation, &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination, and protonolysis.







Abstract
The mechanism and the origin of the regioselectivity of the rhodium/diene&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of C1&#8208;substituted oxabenzonorbornadienes with arylboronic acids has been examined using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The overall mechanism for the reaction is considered as a four&#8208;step reaction including transmetalation, carborhodation, &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination, and protonolysis. The free energy profiles show that the rate&#8208;determining step is involved in the protonolysis step which differs from previous mechanistic studies on metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of oxabenzonorbornadienes. Additionally, it is theorized the &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination step is the origin of regioselectivity. DFT calculations predict the formation of the 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted naphthalene framework is selective over the 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted product, in agreement with experimental observations.

&lt;p&gt;The mechanism and the origin of the regioselectivity of the rhodium/diene&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of C1&#8208;substituted oxabenzonorbornadienes with arylboronic acids has been examined by M06/Def2TZVP using density functional theory (DFT). The overall mechanism for the reaction is considered as a four&#8208;step reaction including transmetalation, carborhodation, &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination, and protonolysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism and the origin of the regioselectivity of the rhodium/diene&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of C1&#8208;substituted oxabenzonorbornadienes with arylboronic acids has been examined using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The overall mechanism for the reaction is considered as a four&#8208;step reaction including transmetalation, carborhodation, &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination, and protonolysis. The free energy profiles show that the rate&#8208;determining step is involved in the protonolysis step which differs from previous mechanistic studies on metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of oxabenzonorbornadienes. Additionally, it is theorized the &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination step is the origin of regioselectivity. DFT calculations predict the formation of the 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted naphthalene framework is selective over the 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted product, in agreement with experimental observations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric direct Michael reaction of ketones with trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylnitroethenes has been developed by using optically pure L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;based secondary&#8208;amino aromatic Tf&#8208;amide organocatalyst. The effect of diethylmethylamine base additive is of crucial importance to accelerate the reaction and also to achieve high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric direct Michael reaction of ketones with trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylnitroethenes can be achieved under the influence of optically pure L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;based secondary&#8208;amino aromatic Tf&#8208;amide organocatalyst. The effect of the trialkylamine base additive such as diethylmethylamine is of paramount importance to accomplish high reactivity and enantioselectivity in this asymmetric Michael reaction.

It has been established that an electron&#8208;deficient bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienyl (CpE) rhodium(III) complex catalyzes the oxidative intramolecular 1,1&#8208;oxyamination of alkenes with N&#8208;benzoyl amino acids to produce oxazoloisoindole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed that this oxidative 1,1&#8208;oxyamination proceeds via not the aza&#8208;Wacker reaction but the formation of a rhoda(III)oxazolidine initiated by the carboxylic acid&#8208;directed N&#8722;H bond cleavage.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>

         <dc:description>A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner&#8217;s thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible via rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization via multipoint mutual interactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract:  A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes, bearing different substituents in the 1&#8208;naphthyl moieties have been prepared to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the stacked arenes. The best geometries were determined by means of DFT calculations, and experimentally checked by NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). High temperature NMR spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the balance between dispersive and electrostatic contributions (ratio between two diastereomeric  syn/anti  isomers of compounds  1  &#8208;  6  ), while ECD analysis of the  syn  isomers of compounds  3  &#8208;  5  allowed for a deeper insight on the electrostatic contributions that drive the geometry between the interacting rings. The two rings preferentially adopt a parallel displaced geometry, whose interaction energy is strongly influenced by the electrostatic features of the two naphthyl rings, and that dispersive forces play a very minor role.</dc:description>

         <title>A kinetic photometric assay for the quantification of aldoses&#8217; open&#8208;chain content</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldoses exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form, which is in equilibrium with the open&#8208;chain aldehyde form. The small aldehyde content hampers reactivity when chemistry addresses the carbonyl moiety. This low concentration of the available aldehyde is generally difficult to ascertain. Herein, we demonstrate a new kinetic determination of the (minute) open&#8208;chain content (OCC) of aldoses. This kinetic approach exploits the aldehyde&#8208;selectivity of 2&#8208;aminobenzamidoxime (ABAO), which furnishes a strongly UV&#8208;active adduct. Simple formation curves can be measured in a photometer or plate reader for high&#8208;throughput screening. Under pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics, these curves correlate with a prediction model yielding the relative OCC. The OCCs of all parent aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) were determined referencing against the two tetroses with exceptionally high OCCs and were in very good agreement with literature data. Additionally, the assay was extended towards higher&#8208;carbon sugars with unknown OCC and also applied to rationalise a lack of reactivity observed in a recent synthetic investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydroarylative Coupling of Indolines with Internal Alkynes via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a regioselective hydroarylative coupling of indolines with internal alkynes via the activation of C&#8211;H bond using inexpensive Ru(II)&#8208;catalyst. This redox&#8208;neutral, atom&#8208;economical, and scalable C&#8211;H functionalization has been accomplished using easily removable weakly coordinating directing group. Diverse unsymmetrically substituted alkynes appended with pharmacologically important heterocycles were coupled with various indolines and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines to furnish the corresponding trisubstituted alkenes with very high regioselectivity. The application of the method has been demonstrated with a number of alkyne&#8208;containing drug molecules, natural product, carbohydrates, amino acids, steroids and other heterocycles. Preliminary mechanistic interrogation revealed that the C&#8211;H activation proceeds through base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic&#8208;type substitution process.</dc:description>

         <title>A diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large libraries of artificial macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large artificial macrocycle libraries with a ring size of 13&#8211;18 atoms relying on the "build&#8208;couple&#8208;pair" strategy is disclosed. The "couple" phase included three one&#8208;pot steps including consequent amide coupling of N &#8208;Boc&#8208;mono&#173;protected vicinal diamines with two alkenyl carboxylic acids, followed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key "pair" step. The scope and limitations of the method were established for all three reagents. In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8211;C&#8211;C&#8211;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8901;10 5 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving a rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0 g).</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketone and of Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (  1  ) and of its alcoholic derivatives (  cis  &#8208;  2  and  trans&#8208;  3  ). Specifically, two enzymes from our in house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone  1  or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic  cis  &#8208;alcohol (  2  ) was very efficiently obtained (E &#8773; 2.000) by lipase&#8208;PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with e.e. &#8805; 95%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials: unravelling the emissive behaviour of chloro&#8208;substituted derivatives of cyclic triimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic luminophores that exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are receiving an ever growing attention. The design of efficient RTP materials and the understanding of their emissive behaviour, however, remain a challenging task. Herein, to gain further insights into metal&#8208;free RTP, we report the synthesis, characterization and photophysical study of chloro&#8208;derivatives of [1,2&#8208;  a  :1',2'&#8208;  c  :1'',2''&#8208;  e  ][1,3,5]triazine or cyclic triimidazole (  TT  ). Mono&#8208; (  1Cl  ), di&#8208; (  2Cl  ) and tri&#8208;chloro&#8208;  TT  (  3Cl  ) derivatives are prepared by mild chlorination with  N  &#8211;chlorosuccinimide (NCS). The three &#160;compounds are characterized by aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) comprising &#160;dual fluorescence and multiple phosphorescences, whose origin is disclosed by crystal structure analysis together with accurate DFT/TDDFT calculations. Comparison with previously reported bromine and iodine  TT  derivatives reveals the new chlorinated compounds as the best performing halogenated AIE members of the family.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and additive&#8208;free hydrogenation of nitroarenes mediated by a DMSO&#8208;tagged molecular cobalt corrole catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first cobalt corrole that effectively mediates the homogeneous hydrogenation of structurally diverse nitroarenes to afford the corresponding amines. The given catalyst is easily assembled prior to use from 4&#8208; tert &#8208;butylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole followed by metalation of the resulting corrole macrocycle with cobalt(II) acetate. The thus&#8208;prepared complex is self&#8208;contained in that the hydrogenation protocol is free from the requirement for adding any auxiliary reagent to elicit the catalytic activity of the applied metal complex. Moreover, a containment system is not required for the assembly of the hydrogenation reaction set&#8208;up as both the autoclave and the reaction vessels are readily charged under a regular laboratory atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Deoxygenation of 2&#176; Benzylic Alcohols through a Sequence of Formylation and B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequence of formylation and B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the resulting formate with Et3SiH enables the chemoselective deoxygenation of secondary benzylic alcohols. Primary benzylic and tertiary non&#8208;benzylic alcohols are not reduced by this protocol. The formyl group fulfills a double role as activator and self&#8208;sacrificing protecting group. The deoxygenation of these formates is fast and can be carried out in the presence of other potentially reducible groups. Neighboring&#8208;group participation was found in the deoxygenation of certain diol motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;step Synthesis of 4H&#8208;Cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene from Pyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4  H  &#8208;Cyclopenta[  def  ]phenanthrene (CPP) is a valuable building block in the production of optically active polymers, which find use in a wide range of organic electronic applications. Of particular importance is their use in the development of blue&#8208;colored, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which remains a challenge in the field. Unfortunately, commercial sources and synthetic procedures known in the literature are unable to provide enough CPP for large scale implementation. Here we report on the development of a novel, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of CPP in three steps, starting from pyrene. The key steps in our methodology are the ring contraction of pyrene&#8208;4,5&#8208;dione to oxoCPP in a single step, as well as the direct reduction of oxoCPP to CPP. Apart from the small number of synthetic steps, our methodology benefits from the use of relatively non&#8208;hazardous reagents, together with optimized purification procedures, making CPP accessible in useful quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Butterfly Mesogens Based on Carbazole, Fluorene or Fluorenone: Mesomorphous, Gelling, Photophysical, and Photoconductive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic synthetic method based on the Suzuki&#8208;Scholl reactions was successfully exploited to yield new poly(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons containing carbazole, fluorene or fluorenone moieties. These butterfly&#8208;like mesogens exhibit columnar mesophases, form fibrous gels in various solvents, emit blue to orange light in films and solutions and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the &#8764;0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range.







Abstract
We report a straightforward and generic synthesis of several new series of annulated &#960;&#8208;extended poly&#8208;(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), with carbazole, fluorene and fluorenone central building blocks by the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Scholl tandem reactions. The corresponding series of ditriphenylene discogens with a carbazole or a fluorenone central core, respectively, possess hexagonal columnar mesophases with broad mesophase ranges and high clearing points, as well as demonstrate a strong aggregation tendency in organic solvents as supergelators. The laterally&#8208;substituted ditriphenylene mesogens based on dimethyl&#8208;fluorene core exhibit a rich polymorphism with rectangular and hexagonal columnar mesophases from low temperatures onward, whereas their dioctyl&#8208;fluorene homologues melt directly into the isotropic liquid without showing mesophases. These latter family of compounds are luminescent with very high fluorescent quantum yields, of around 70&#8201;% in solution, and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, as measured by photocurrent transient time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (TOF) technique. This straightforward molecular design and simple synthetic strategy proved to be both potent and resilient, and could be generally applied to the fabrication of a great variety of other heteroarene molecular systems as organic semiconductors and electroluminescent materials for potentially low&#8208;cost applications.

This straightforward molecular design and simple synthetic strategy proved to be both potent and resilient, and could be generally applied to the fabrication of a great variety of other heteroarene molecular systems as organic semiconductors and electroluminescent materials for potentially low&#8208;cost applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C(sp2&#8211;H)&#8208;trifluoromethylation of hydrazones would give access to the a&#8208;trifluoromethylated hydrazones that can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically interesting fluorinated compounds. Here, we demonstrate the Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2&#8211;H)&#8208; trifluoromethylation of the aldehyde hydrazones using the readily available and cost effective Langlois reagent (sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate). This reaction is broadly applicable to a series of aromatic aldehyde N&#8208;aminomorpholine hydrazones to give the corresponding C(sp2)&#8208;trifluoromethyl hydrazones in moderate to high yields. The reaction generally tolerates a series of electron&#8208;releasing as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar and Rigid Pyrazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitter for Deep Blue Bright Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two blue donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters containing pyrazine or dipyrazine as electron&#8208;acceptor are presented. The OLEDs based on these two emitters exhibited blue and sky&#8208;blue emission with CIE of (0.15,0.16) and (0.15, 0.30), respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiency for the blue device reached 11.6&#8201;% while for sky blue device it is 7.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) or dipyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz to possess high S1 energies (3.19&#8197;eV and 3.08&#8197;eV, respectively), and relatively large &#916;EST values (0.52&#8197;eV and 0.56&#8197;eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S1 and T1, predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin&#8208;vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states, even the relatively larger &#916;ESTs. The &#916;ESTs for DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz are 0.27&#8197;eV and 0.38&#8197;eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65&#8201;%, and 70&#8201;%, respectively). The decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent with the fact that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on DTCz&#8208;Pz exhibit deep blue emission with &#955;EL of 460&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) reaches 11.6&#8201;%, with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of up to 6892&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, while the device based on DTCz&#8208;DPz exhibits sky blue emission with &#955;EL of 484&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQEmax of 7.2&#8201;%, and Lmax of 8802&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Synthesis of Azolium&#8208;2&#8208;dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions Under Mild, Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

Compared to the previous strategies devised for the synthesis of NHC&#183;CS  2  &#160;betaines, this novel procedure relied on an innocuous, weak base and could be applied under mild aerobic conditions. All the new compounds were fully characterized by various analytical techniques and the molecular structures of two of them were determined by XRD analysis. An associative mechanism involving the concerted reaction of the azolium salts with both CS  2  and CO  3  2&#8211;  was tentatively proposed to account for the formation of the zwitterionic adducts without the intervention of free carbenes. This would explain the good results obtained with a weak inorganic base that lacks the strength needed to deprotonate the azolium salt substrates.</dc:description>

An asymmetric method for the amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones using azo compounds is described. The developed process exhibits a wide substrate scope and high efficiency in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74&#8211;96&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in the effectivity of the reaction.

         <dc:description>The often time&#8208;consuming and challenging multi&#8208;step synthesis of ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages is a limiting factor for the discovery and application of new cages.

         <title>The Winding Road towards an Atropo&#8208;enantioselective &#8216;ARYNE Coupling&#8217;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of aryllithiums onto arynes, leading to axially chiral biaryls in the absence of transition metals, was investigated by means of chiral ligands of lithium. Biaryls with a high degree of steric congestion around the aryl&#8211;aryl bond could be obtained.







Abstract
For the first time, the challenging atropo&#8208;enantioselective coupling of in&#8208;situ generated arynes and aryllithiums in the presence of a chiral ligand of lithium was investigated. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept, by affording enantioenriched axially chiral biaryls even in the case of products showing a high degree of steric congestion around the newly created aryl&#8722;aryl bond.

         <dc:description>
2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3&#8197;V vs SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron oxidizing capacity of 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) improves significantly by visible&#8208;light excitation. The exited&#8208;state DDQ (DDQ*) even converts benzene, fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, benzyls, and olefins into their corresponding radical cations as well as chloride and other anions into their radicals. These reactive intermediates have been utilized for the generation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (N, O, or Cl) bonds in the synthesis of valuable organic compounds and natural products. This mini review provides an overview of such DDQ*&#8208;initiated organic transformations with their scope and limitations and discusses the proposed reactions mechanisms.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Electrochemical Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes Extended with an Anthraquinoid Spacer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer (TTFAQ) functionalized diphenylphosphino groups were successfully synthesized. X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. The cyclic voltammetry suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate. It is the first observation in TTFAQs without TTF moieties.







Abstract
Bis&#8208; and tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer were successfully synthesized. X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. Their average C&#8722;P&#8722;C angles and phosphorus&#8722;carbon distances resemble those of diphenylphosphino&#8208;substituted TTF derivatives. The cyclic voltammograms consisted of one pair of irreversible, simultaneous two&#8208;electron transfer waves. A combination of cyclic voltammetry experiments and DFT calculations suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate.

         <title>Prevalent Bioimaging Scaffolds: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin, xanthene, BODIPY, and cyanine are four of the most prevalent bioimaging scaffolds in chemical biology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationships, and imaging applications of fluorophores based on these units. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each scaffold in bioimaging as well as the practical issues to consider when using small organic compounds in biological systems.







Abstract
This minireview describes the syntheses, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationship, and bioimaging applications of fluorescent coumarins, xanthenes, BODIPYs, and cyanines. Advantages and disadvantages of the emissive units are also discussed, as are general practical issues that need to be considered when using fluorophores in a biological setting.

         <dc:description>3&#8208;Acyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with pendent furans, readily available from dehydroacetic acid, are substrates for intramolecular [4+4]&#8208;photocycloaddition. In the presence of stoichiometric lithium base, these substrates undergo conversion to lactone&#8208;bridged cyclooctenones in moderate to good yields upon irradiation in THF at 0 &#176;C.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  An approach to 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isostere of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained in multigram scale through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A convenient methodology for constructing 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isoster of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;bifunctionalized difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic precursor &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane. The target compounds and intermediates were prepared by short reaction sequences (6&#8211;10 steps) on a multigram scale (up to 0.47 kg).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
