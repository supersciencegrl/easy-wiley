         <title>Photocatalytic Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization : Selective Synthesis of Trifluoroethylated Benzopyran and Benzopyranone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have realized the photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction, enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures and excellent yields.&#160;Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst load, strong regional control and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by the density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be easily accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphosphoric Acid Catalyzed C&#8208;H Dinitration of Passivated Aromatic Compounds with Potassium Nitrate under Mild Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitroaromatics are valuable organic compounds. However, the high value of these compounds is accompanied by significant risks and formidable challenges. Herein, we report a safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatic compounds, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the traditional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoiodine Catalysed Intramolecular C&#8722;N bond Oxidative Coupling for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Monosubstituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8211;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal and additive&#8208;free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N,3&#8208;diarylpropanamides via in situ thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation&#8208;dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.</dc:description>

Isocoumarins by Ring Transformation: The cyanide catalyzed ring transformation of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester is the key transformation for the preparation of an optically active isocoumarin derivative.







Abstract
A four step sequence for the preparation of optically active (R,R)&#8208;ethyl 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate is reported. In the first step the first stereocenter was installed by palladium catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of PhB(OH)2 to indenone (88&#8201;% ee). After deprotonation, the ester moiety was introduced with Mander's reagent. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the resulting &#946;&#8208;oxoester was then achieved with cerium&#8208;catalysis under an air atmosphere. Key transformation was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester furnishing the &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety of the target compound, which was formed as a mixture of separable cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereoisomers, both with 88&#8201;% ee. The cis&#8208;isomer could be epimerized to the trans&#8208;compound. The relative trans and the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration of the target compound was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Adaptable Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Disaccharide Subtypes Preprogrammed for Regiospecific O&#8208;Sulfation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors is presented herein. The route employs an orthogonal protecting group pattern and a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach to access CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O disaccharide precursors on gram scale.

A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors, including rarer subtypes such as CS&#8722;D, has been developed. From common intermediates, a series of thioglycoside D&#8208;glucosyl donors and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected D&#8208;galactosamine acceptors are utilised in a robust glycosylation reaction, achieving &#946;&#8208;selectivity and consistent yields (60&#8211;75&#8201;%) on scales &gt;2.0&#8197;g. A post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation to D&#8208;glucuronic acid and orthogonal protecting groups delivers access to CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O precursor subtypes. Of further note is a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl regioselective reductive ring opening of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected disaccharide using dichlorophenylborane (PhBCl2) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH) to access a CS&#8722;D precursor, in 73&#8201;% yield over two steps. Finally, synthesis of a 6&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated CS&#8722;C disaccharide containing a conjugable anomeric allyl tether is completed. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.

&lt;p&gt;A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors is presented herein. The route employs an orthogonal protecting group pattern and a post-glycosylation oxidation approach to access CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O disaccharide precursors on gram scale. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) display unique biochemical activities. However, their facile synthesis remains a big challenge due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilicity and alkalinity natures. Recently, the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical process provides a robust tool for various bond formations due to the high reactivity and less sensitive to steric hindrance of radical species. This review summarizes the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Tris(3&#8208;Pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1, 3, 5&#8208;Triazine Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) and tris(BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold were synthesized over a sequence of steps and our spectral and theoretical studies supported the presence of excitonic interactions between the fluorophores in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) whereas the tris(BODIPY) did not show such interactions.







Abstract
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine tris(p&#8208;oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;tris(meso&#8208;p&#8208;oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et3N/BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 afforded fluorescent tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods. Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, and transient&#8208;absorption studies revealed that in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates With Triazolium Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid phase synthesis of lysine and peptide conjugates of Safirinium derivatives allowed demonstration of the relevance of Safirinium&#8208;lysine conjugates and building blocks as inhibitors of porcine pancrease elastase.







Abstract
Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates. Herein we present the design and synthesis of four Safirinium derivatives, their facile conjugation to lysine in solid phase, and incorporation in peptides. The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed. We present herein the potential of the Safirinium analogs to act as elastase inhibitors in assays performed on porcine pancreas elastase.

         <title>Conformational and Electron Density Analysis of Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes: All Roads Lead to Boats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes has been studied through mapping potential energy surface analysis employing DFT computational methods. Also, the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms on the conformational equilibrium have been analyzed employing the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. Finally, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) approach pinpoints key atoms in the conformer stability.







Abstract
In view of the existence of an optimal conformation for molecular recognition and bearing in mind that nucleosides exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical properties, whereby their conformation has a key role in molecular recognition, the tendency of the pseudosugar moiety in carbanucleosides to adopt a boat&#8208;like conformation has been studied on the basis of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane system, resulting in versatile drug&#8208;like scaffolds to increase molecular recognition. It is already known that using this system as pseudosugar can fix the conformation in the Northern or Southern geometry, required for biological activity, according to the relative position of the three&#8208;member cycle. By mapping their energy potential surface, we investigate the preference for boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. DFT is utilized alongside NBO analysis to explore the enhanced stability of boat&#8208;like conformers, also considering the influence of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms. Additionally, charge density distribution analysis using QTAIM identifie key atoms contributing to stability changes. These findings will help to comprehend this behavior in the drug discovery process when conformationally restricted nucleosides are involved.

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal reactions including Cope rearrangements and E/Z isomerisations of three diterpenoids were investigated experimentally. In addition, DFT calculations were performed to explain the experimental findings of this study and of related systems from the literature. It is demonstrated that accurate computational data are only obtained, if ensembles of most stable conformers are considered.







Abstract
Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8800;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).

         <title>Fluorinated Chiral Pyrans Obtained via Mechanochemical Organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis Reactions Catalyzed by Organic Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis with good yields and broad functional group tolerance has been developed. The bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donor shows a high catalytic activity for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction and mechanistic investigations support the hypothesis of halogen&#8208;bond catalysis.







Abstract
The carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis reaction is a powerful method for the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now report on the development of a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed protocol for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction. Our studies revealed that methanol is a highly efficient solvent and that a very broad range of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support the proposed halogen&#8208;bond interaction. Furthermore, the halogen&#8208;bond protocol is compared with other available catalytic systems for these reactions.

         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium salt mediated methodology activating sulfur atom, promoting the conversion of sulfides into sulfoxides exploiting DMSO as the sole oxidant. An easy access to pharmaceutical active compounds such as Sulforaphane and Modafinil.







Abstract
Compounds bearing the sulfoxide moiety display an important class of molecules in pharmaceutical industry. Many efforts have been made towards the development of novel, sustainable, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute and industrially friendly processes. A novel iodonium&#8208;salt&#8208;mediated oxidation protocol for the conversion of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides is reported, employing DMSO as the oxidant. Several sulfides decorated with various functional groups were tested, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields with remarkable chemoselectivity. The oxidation protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) Sulforaphane and Modafinil.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamide and diaryldiselenide under visible light irradiation, and develops an effective method for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selenide. Oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, avoiding the addition of environmentally unfriendly photocatalysts and oxidants.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of alpha&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;beta&#8208;seleno amides containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds by selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamine amides with diaryl diselenides under visible light irradiation. This protocol proceeds well to provide the 30 desired products with yields of 37&#8201;%&#8211;80&#8201;% using the 12&#8197;W blue LED as light source under room temperature conditions. Moreover, diaryl diselenides plays a dual role as a substrate and a photoactive reagent, as well as oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, thus avoiding the extra addition of environmentally unfriendly photoctalysts and oxidants.

         <title>Front Cover: Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates With Triazolium Derivatives (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 38/2024)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a set of Safirinium&#8208;dye derivatives used for the facile preparation of peptide conjugates as potential elastase inhibitors, by exploiting a lysine side chain as an effective linker between the dye and the peptide. With an optimized peptide sequence forming the core and triazolium derivatives acting as particular caps, we can create molecular tools capable of tuning the activity of a selected enzyme. Details of this approach are reported in the Research Article by R. Latajka, A.&#8197;M. Papini and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400399). Structure taken from PDB ID: 1QR3.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Carbohydrates Containing 3&#8208;Membered Heterocycles, Key Precursors of Modified Sugars and Mimetics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 38, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered heterocycles, including oxiranes (epoxides), thiiranes (episulfides), and aziridines, serve as key synthetic precursors. When attached to a chiral carbohydrate, cyclitol, or carbasugar molecule, these heterocycles undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This review summarizes recent advancements in the synthesis and ring&#8208;opening of this type of heterocycles and their varied applications in glycobiology.







Abstract
Molecules containing three&#8208;membered heterocycles, including oxiranes (epoxides), thiiranes (episulfides) and aziridines, are considered privileged structures as they serve as key precursors or intermediates for the synthesis of a varied range of organic compounds, such as natural products, mimetics and pharmaceuticals. The principal advantage of this type of heterocycles is their reactivity towards the nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening, which usually occurs in a regioselective manner, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted products. When attached to a chiral scaffold, such as a carbohydrate molecule, the ring&#8208;opening process is usually highly diastereoselective. Therefore, these compounds have been extensively employed in the field of carbohydrates for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure modified sugars that are useful as glycobiology tools. This review presents an overview of the recent methodologies developed for the construction of epoxide, thiirane, and aziridine rings from common or modified sugars. Due to their structural similarity to carbohydrates, three&#8208;membered heterocyclic derivatives of cyclitols and carbasugars have been included. All these compounds, and their ring&#8208;opening derivatives have shown to be crucial in the synthesis of glycomimetics, which display diverse biological activities. These include enzyme inhibition, binding to lectin receptors, and more recently, the use as probes for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Catalyzed Cascade C&#8211;H Functionalization: An Atom&#8208;Economical Strategy to Access Diverse 2&#8208;Substituted Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails a one&#8208;pot, cascade carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Bronsted acid and a ligand source at the in situ generated I(III) centre. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors. Mechanistic studies were carried out, and the synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated for the synthesis of the benzothiazole&#8208;based antitumor drug GW&#8208;610.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Semisaturated Fused Polycyclic Iminosugars by a Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars were synthesized by one&#8208;pot stereoselective three&#8208;component reactions of D&#8208;ribose tosylate, aniline and cycloenones under heating conditions. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. In this way, various novel complex fused iminosugars were obtained through a normal Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism at 80 &#176;C. This strategy will enable the preparation of bioactive iminosugar analogues with structural diversity.</dc:description>

A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates.

With lower catalyst loadings (0.03 mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategy for C&#8211;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarized a strategy for C&#8211;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field.

         <title>A new CuI/oxalamide catalytic system for the large&#8208;scale aerobic oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8208;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100 mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin as Efficient Catalyst for Sonogashira Coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi Type Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been successfully applied as catalyst in Sonogashira coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation reactions, performed under air and copper&#8208;free conditions using very small metal loading (between 0.25 and 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%).







Abstract
A palladium catalyst supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been tested in the Sonogashira coupling reactions of a wide range of aryl iodides and terminal alkynes. The best catalytic performance was obtained at 90&#8201;&#176;C using only 0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;% metal loading under copper&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of a H2O/EtOH (3&#8201;:&#8201;2 v/v) solvent mixture and triethylamine as the base, affording the coupling products in good yields. The Pd/SF&#8208;based protocol was then successfully extended to the synthesis of benzofurans through Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation of 2&#8208;iodophenol with terminal alkynes. Preliminary investigations on the recyclability and the heterogeneous behaviour of the catalyst were performed: hot filtration test and leaching test evidenced the presence of a small amount of soluble active palladium species into the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, Pd/SF could be reused in recharging test and it can be recycled in four consecutive runs with no significant deactivation.

         <dc:description>
A Convergent, thiol&#8208; and metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives were developed from readily available precursors such as aryl ketone, aromatic amine and elemental sulfur. This reaction involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and one new C&#8722;N bond in single step employing environmentally benign iodine as the catalyst. Photophysical properties like quantum yield, solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission were also explored. Moreover, HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap was calculated for few compounds which suggests the possibility of Intramolecular charge transfer.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of 2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;one was achieved via iodine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and a C&#8722;N bond from the readily available precursors &#8208; aryl methyl ketones, p&#8208;anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields. As the synthesized benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;ones are fluorescent under UV light, photophysical properties like solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE), and the relative quantum yields of the compounds were measured which proves them to be a potential candidate for the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;Ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed to the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases via the syn conformation in DNA.</dc:description>

In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick-type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano-dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases via the syn conformation in DNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs): Highly Nucleophilic Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs) are enamines with strongly polarized exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. The 2&#8208;pyNHOs react with quinone methides to give zwitterionic adducts or the entirely neutral adduct tautomers. The kinetics of 2&#8208;pyNHO/electrophile reactions were studied and evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation. With nucleophilicities N from 19.4 to 21.2, 2&#8208;pyNHOs are significantly more reactive than classical enamines.







Abstract
The high reactivity of 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines also known as 2&#8208;methylpyridinium derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (2&#8208;pyNHOs) has been recognized in organic synthesis, yet a quantification of their nucleophilicity is lacking. Herein we used stopped&#8208;flow photometry to determine the nucleophilicity of a series of 2&#8208;pyNHOs from the kinetics of their reactions with quinone methides and benzhydrylium ions as reference electrophiles in four organic solvents at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The kinetic data was evaluated by using the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg&#8201;k(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E), which gave nucleophilicity parameters N (and sN). With N in the range of 19.4&#8211;21.2 (in DMSO), 2&#8208;pyNHOs exceed the reactivity of classical enamines, such as pyrrolidino&#8208;cyclopent&#8208;1&#8208;ene. The addition of 2&#8208;pyNHOs to quinone methides resulted in the formation of zwitterionic adducts with pyridinium and phenolate moieties. Subsequent tautomerization yielded entirely neutral pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;phenol species in several cases. Formation of the zwitterionic adducts from 2&#8208;pyNHOs and neutral electrophiles was almost equally fast in the polar solvents acetonitrile and DMSO, but proceeded one to two orders of magnitude slower in the less polar solvents dichloromethane or THF.

Abstract
An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines or N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole using 2&#8208;methylquinoline or 2&#8208;methylbenzo[d]thiazole, arylamines, and &#945;&#8208;ketoesters was developed. The methyl group of methyl aza&#8208;arenes incorporated in the Povarov reaction via an iodination/Kornblum oxidation sequence. This method was achieved through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process without the need for transition metals, demonstrating excellent scalability in synthesis.

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Domino Reactions on Carbohydrates: State of the Art</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domino transformations play a crucial role as chemical tools in drug discovery processes. This review showcases various instances of domino transformations applied to carbohydrates, with the goal of summarizing their chemical potential in producing sugar&#8208;derived compounds. These compounds have significant applications in generating new chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and chemical biology.







Abstract
The intricate nature of carbohydrate structures has prompted the scientific community to seek efficient protocols for their manipulation. Lengthy synthetic pathways, often necessary to achieve complex sugar structures, pose challenges not only in terms of time and cost but also regarding environmental sustainability. Consequently, domino transformations serve as valuable tools in streamlining drug discovery processes. Sequential procedures involving fewer steps and minimal isolation/purification steps are particularly appealing to organic chemists in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. This review highlights several examples of domino transformations applied to carbohydrates, aiming to summarize their chemical potential in delivering sugar&#8208;based compounds with significant applications in the generation of new chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and chemical biology.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of Cyanoformamides from Isocyanates and a Highly Reactive Nitrile Anion Reservoir</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective preparation of cyanoformamides from widely available isocyanates and a reactive silyl cyanide&#8211;as the competent nucleophilic CN anion &#8211; is reported. The methodology requires the use of a suitable Lewis base (potassium tert&#8208;pentoxide) for the proper activation of the cyanide donor.







Abstract
The direct addition of a nitrile anion to isocyanates is reported for a straightforward preparation of valuable cyanoformamides. Through the proper activation of an adequate silicon&#8208;ate complex precursor (PhMe2SiCN) with a Lewis base (potassium tert&#8208;amylate) under Barbier&#8208;type conditions, the cyanide was instantaneously released, thus yielding the desired motif with full chemocontrol. No particular structural restriction was noticed for engaging in the transformation a wide series of commercially available isocyanates.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium in Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis: Unique Reactivity, Mechanisms and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged as a prominent research area in modern organic synthesis and environmental science. As an important transition metal, chromium has garnered widespread attention in the field of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis in recent years, primarily manifested in the following aspects: a) the unique photochemical properties of chromium(III) complexes endow them with longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes and higher reactivities; b) by harnessing visible light to induce single&#8208;electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer to generate radicals, which subsequently form alkyl&#8208;chromium(III) intermediates with chromium(II) ligands, these intermediates can selectively attack electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of target products; c) following metals like cerium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and bismuth, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction pathways in chromium photocatalysis have also been extensively investigated.This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their unique reactivity, mechanisms, and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sulfoCy5&#8208; and sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8211;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8211;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalysis for the Oxidative Dearomatization of PyrroleDerivatives: Mechanistic Insights and Biological Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported an oxidative dearoamatization of pyrrole derivatives to give a highly functionalized isoindolinone derivatives. Synthesized products have been analyzed for their non&#8208;cytotoxic behavior and two of them have been utilized for their antipromastigotic activity against L. Donovanai. In addition to that the mechanism has also been explored using DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report dearomatization of pyrrole ring followed by rearomatization of cyclohexyl ring to obtain isoindolinone scaffold by a Pd/Cu dual catalysis approach in an atom economic way with moderate to high yield. The expected Pd/Cu catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8208;H activation via normal catalytic cycle can be override by unusual oxidative dearomatization reaction which has been established by DFT calculation. The biological importance of isoindolinone scaffold insists us to successfully investigate in&#8197;vitro antileishmanial activity of L.Donovani.

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer&#8208;indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion Of N&#8208;Troponyl&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives Into Cationic Troponyl&#8208;Oxazolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole and benzoxazolidine are constituents of various bioactive natural/synthetic molecules comprising benzenoid aromatic residue. However, non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffolds such as tropone and tropolone are also found in natural products. This report describes the synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8208;1.2 V. Hence, cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidinyl amino acids/peptides could be promising analogs of benzoxazolidine for the development of therapeutic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Divinylbenzene Co&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker in &#160;a&#160;Threefold Cross&#8208;Linked Polystyrene&#8208;Phosphine Hybrid Monolith: Impact of Cross&#8208;Linking Degree on Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow organic transformations using immobilized catalysts are crucial for green and sustainable chemistry. Cross&#8208;linked polymer ligands offer high stability, ease of recovery through filtration, and thus enhance performance in continuous&#8208;flow reactions via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Additionally, the cross&#8208;linking structure of the polymer support creates a unique reaction platform that controls the coordination behavior of the supported ligands and stabilizes the metal catalysts. However, insights into the material&#8208;based design for preparing highly active and durable immobilized metal catalysts are still limited. In this report, we propose a straightforward approach to boost both selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of metal complexes. We developed threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths with cross&#8208;linking structures adjusted by varying the content of divinylbenzene as co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker. The coordination behaviors and metal&#8208;support interactions of these monoliths were evaluated, highlighting the importance of co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker content in site&#8208;isolating phosphine units and stabilizing metal centers via arene&#8208;metal interactions on the polystyrene network. By optimizing the cross&#8208;linking structure, the monolith catalysts demonstrated exceptionally high catalytic activity and durability in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;Cl transformations, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations in continuous flow. This underscores the utility of our monolith system in challenging transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2&#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39 mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal-and solvent-free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, the first mechanochemical asymmetric Robinson annulation reaction was reported and chiral 3,5-diaryl-cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this method. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Ketones and Aldimines with Ammonia Borane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenation of organic compounds employing low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalysts is highly desirable as the corresponding hydrogenated products have significant importance in pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industries. Herein, a cobalt(II) complex supported by &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand has been easily prepared by treatment of anhydrous CoCl2 with diimine, which can catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated bond with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. A variety of ketones and aldimines bearing diverse functional groups can be reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines in moderate to excellent yields at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that several readily reducible functional groups such as nitro and cyano are tolerated under the standard reaction conditions. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reaction has been successfully carried out and the procedure could be handled easily, which both make this methodology general and practical.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Spirocyclization Reactions: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Spiropenicillanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a continuous flow approach to chiral spiropenicillanates with remarkable bioactive properties from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates via phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with diphenyldiazomethane.
Model reactions were carried out using simple alkenes, such as methyl vinyl ketone and&#160;N&#8208;substituted maleimides, leading to the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 96%). The [3+2] annulation reaction was subsequently extended to the reactivity of 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates, a more complex 2&#960;&#8208;component with an exocyclic carbon&#8208;carbon double bond, allowing the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds. Two regioisomeric chiral spirocyclopentene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams were obtained, in moderate to good overall yields (31&#8208;84%). The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions between 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates and diphenyldiazomethane under continuous flow conditions&#160;gave the corresponding spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates in high yields (up to 81%).&#160;Thermal ring contraction, via N2&#160;extrusion, of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates under continuous&#160;flow conditions led&#160;to spirocyclopropanepenicillanates in quantitative yields.&#160;
The continuous flow proved to be an efficient methodology for the synthesis of&#160;spiropenicillanates and represents&#160;a more sustainable approach for the scale&#8208;up synthesis of spiropenicillanates with relevant biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions to Corannulene Accelerated by &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of Ru complexes to corannulene increases substantially its reactivity as a dienophile in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions because of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering effect. Lowering of the repulsive Pauli repulsion term is driven by the charge transfer from the corannulene to the metal moiety.







Abstract
The influence of different (LRu)nII (L=Cp&#8211; (n=1, 2); C6H6) moieties &#951;6&#8208;coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)+, (Benzene)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)+, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.

&lt;p&gt;The influence of different (LRu)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; (L=Cp&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; (n=1, 2); C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) moieties &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (Benzene)Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and (CpRu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non-coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and (CpRu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so-called Pauli repulsion-lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinating mono- or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction in the external &lt;i&gt;rim&lt;/i&gt; bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of o&#8208;Iodoanilines with Acrylates or Acrylic Acids: A Convenient One&#8208;Step Route to 2&#8208;Quinolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient method is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones from o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize redox&#8208;neutral base. The reaction mechanism involving a Heck coupling intermediate is well investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and general method for the construction of 2&#8208;quinolinones was developed in this paper. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of various o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids proceeded smoothly to produce 2&#8208;quinolinones in 28&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% yields. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize suitable base, such as potassium pivalate and potassium acetate. Various synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro groups, remained intact during the reaction. The effects of catalyst and base on this cyclization reaction and kinetic experiments were investigated to understand the aspect of the reaction.

         <dc:description>Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to the construction of novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited&#8208;state photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole. And the yield of (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;product was up to 91% after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues exhibit potent RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities, which suggests promising prospect of the novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti&#8208;osteoporosis drug development.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described a gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of Z&#8208;hemiindigo frameworks from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and on a gram&#8208;scale. Importantly, this method enables a simple and efficient synthesis of the special hemiindigo derivatives for the development of environmentally sensitive photoswitches in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction on a Labile Framework of Enone and Acrylamide: Tricyclohexylphosphine as a Stable and Economical Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (IRC) reaction is an atom&#8208;economical way of making carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings. However, its sensitivity towards electronic and steric parameters limits the reaction and stems the need for further development. Acrylamides have been one such left out of their sensitivity. Herein we report an IRC reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate. The cyclization has been achieved on a labile and challenging framework, prone to decomposition. Different control experiments have addressed the instability of the precursor. Protocol was further extendable to annulation for benzo analogs. We also report tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) as a stable, commercial, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nucleophilic catalyst in the field of IRC reactions as compared to earlier well&#8208;established trimethyl and tributyl phosphines. Me3P and Bu3P although useful, are sensitive, prone to oxidation, and need careful handling. The protocol leads to the synthesis of piperidone and dihydroquinolone frameworks. A quick study to test the feasibility of catalyzing the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction by PCy3 was also done successfully, although in moderate yields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bis&#8208;guanidinate anion stabilized amido magnesium (II) compound [LMgN(SiMe3)2; L = {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8208;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar = 2,6&#8208;Et2&#8208;C6H3}] (Mg&#8208;1) has been synthesized and characterized. It has been successfully employed as a pre&#8208;catalyst for the catalytic C&#8208;C coupling of terminal alkynes with carbodiimides, producing propiolamidine products with moderate to good yields. The active catalyst bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide [LMgC&#8801;C&#8208;Ph]2 (Mg&#8208;2) and the intermediate magnesium propiolamidinate [LMg{(NiPr)2C}C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph] (Mg&#8208;3) involved in the catalytic reaction were isolated and thoroughly characterized through multinuclear NMR and mass spectral analyses, as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Based on the above findings, a plausible mechanistic cycle has been proposed. Additionally, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate supported structurally characterized magnesium propiolamidate compound [LMg{(4&#8208;CH3&#8208;C6H4)N&#8208;(C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)=O]2 (Mg&#8208;4) has been described via the reaction between Mg&#8208;2 and isocyanate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of polychloroalkylated indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been achieved via aryldiazonium salt induced radical cyclization reaction of N&#8208;methylallyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylindoles with polychloromethanes. In this reaction, neither metal catalyst nor additional oxidant was required, and an isoquinoline ring was constructed by tandem radical additions on the nonactivated carbon&#8722;carbon double bond of allyl group in 2&#8208;arylindoles. This protocol features advantages of wide substituent scope, environmentally friendly conditions and good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of the Pyoverdine Chromophore: Expanding the Toolbox for the Preparation of Pyoverdine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyoverdine chromophore is an important component of a family of siderophores which are secreted by the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa for iron absorption. In this study, an efficient and improved synthetic route to the chromophore structure is reported, beginning from readily available starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8208;DOPA. This strategy has not only delivered the first synthesis of the free pyoverdine D chromophore, but also offers potential access to a wide range of other pyoverdine chromophore species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with yields going from 43% to quantitative isolated yield. We showed that a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Aerial Oxidation And Atom&#8208;economical C&#8208;3 Chalcogenation Of Indolines Facilitated By Potassium Tert&#8208;butoxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally straightforward and highly efficient potassium tert&#8208;butoxide facilitated protocol for the C&#8208;3 chalcogenation of indolines under catalyst and additive&#8208;free conditions has been established under ambient temperature. The salient features of the process include the development of transition metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free and iodine&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economic and cost&#8208;effective reaction conditions at room temperature in DMSO as solvent for regioselective generation of 3&#8208;chalcogenyl indoles in high yields. The mechanistic interpretation through controlled experiments and analysis of intermediates suggests the prevalence of the ionic pathway. The reaction is scalable to gram&#8208;scale without a significant decrease in product yield, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale applications. This protocol offers a practical and environment friendly approach to accessing a diverse range of 3&#8208;arylthioindoles and 3&#8208;arylselenylindoles withstanding electron releasing and withdrawing substituents in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the biological evaluation of the 3&#8208;arylselenylindole products exhibited significant activity against breast cancer and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines MCF&#8208;7, and MDA&#8208;MB 231. These results indicate the derivatives to be potent candidates for further SAR study.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present an efficient radical approach for the enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) as a catalyst under mild conditions, without the need for metals, photocatalysts, and other additives. Prochiral &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals generated from RAEs were successfully introduced to N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives, including&#160;pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline,&#160;resulting in a range of valuable chiral alkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes with secondary amines in high yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). The chiral phosphoric acid catalyst not only activates the substrate and induces asymmetry but also facilitates essential electron transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkoxyamines for Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry have begun to find their spot in a synthetic chemist&#8217;s toolbox. Apart from its use of renewable reagents (light and electricity respectively), these methods have enabled pathways that were previously viewed as near impossible. It is therefore essential to develop methods to further advance the field of photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry. Alkoxyamines previously used for initiation of polymerization reactions are now viewed as prime building blocks for photoredox and synthetic electrochemists for their facile reactivity to oxidatively cleave C&#8208;O bonds. This review begins with addressing the first method developed for generating carbocations via a mesolytic cleavage pathway, and then highlights the recent approaches to utilizing photoredox and synthetic electrochemistry on oxidative cleavage of alkoxyamines for nucleophilic substitution reactions. To demonstrate its applicability, this review also highlights its utilization in the enantioselective synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;calycanthidine and (&#8208;)&#8208;psychotriasine.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Application of Sulfur Ylides in Light&#8208;Mediated Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur ylides are essential reagents in various organic reactions like epoxidation and cyclopropanation. While traditionally employed in ionic chemistry, recent advancements in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis reveal their potential as sources of radicals or free carbenes. The photochemical or photocatalytic generation of reactive intermediates using sulfur ylides expands the utility of these reagents in modern organic synthesis, offering sustainable solutions to emerging challenges. Despite early demonstrations in the 1960s, the past years have witnessed a surge in photochemical methods utilizing sulfur ylides as precursors. The use of redox&#8208;active photocatalysts has facilitated numerous radical reactions. This review consolidates key findings in sulfur ylide chemistry, particularly focusing on photo&#8208;mediated reactions, to stimulate further research interest in this dynamic field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, the anion radical [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones was investigated under batch and flow conditions. The reaction was promoted by LiBr as a Lewis acid and catalyzed by Eosin Y under visible light irradiation. Symmetrical enones and asymmetrical unsaturated ketoesters were effectively cyclized to yield substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes in high yield and diastereoselectivity. Through the exploration of different experimental setups and reaction conditions, a precise control over the diastereoselectivity of the process was achieved, favoring the formation of either cis or trans substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes. In&#8208;flow experiments allowed to further improve the efficiency of the methodology, leading to higher productivity and space time yields. Furthermore, DFT investigations were conducted in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five [n,n]&#8208; and [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals with five, six and seven membered rings were prepared by using a formal method from cheap starting materials and reagents and applying simple procedures. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of a more complex spiroacetal, namely the spiro[isobenzofuran&#8208;1,20&#8208;naphtho[1,8b,c]furan] skeleton of the enantiomeric couple oleocaran and elmonin, as an example demonstrating its potential.







Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n=5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n=5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Mono&#8208;and Bimetallic Rhodium(I) and Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Carbon&#8208;Ether&#8208;Carbon (COC) Ligand for the Intramolecular Cyclization of 4&#8208;Pentynoic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of a set of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Rh(I) and Ir(I) complexes featuring carbene&#8208;linker&#8208;carbene (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligands coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion was assessed in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of a series of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Ir(I) and Rh(I) complexes bearing the (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligand, coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion, was evaluated in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. The chelated mononuclear cationic complex [Ir(cod)(COC)]PF6 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; COC=biscarbene ether) displayed the highest reaction rate for 4&#8208;pentynoic acid to form &#947;&#8208;methyl&#8208;ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (5&#8208;methylenedihydrofuran&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one). Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination. Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4&#8208;pentynoic acid derivatives.

         <title>Harnessing Oxoammonium Salts for Oxidations in Organic Synthesis and Catalysis: Origins and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxoammonium cation has been identified as the true oxidant intermediate in many aerobic oxidations promoted by long&#8208;lived nitroxide radicals. Various oxoammonium salts have been synthesized and utilized to perform these oxidation reactions. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenation and oxidative coupling reactions, new types of reactions involving oxoammonium salts have recently been reported. This concept aims to discuss these oxidations from the perspective of reaction mechanisms, with a focus on progress made since 2019. Beyond the electron transfer route for synthesizing oxoammonium salts, four types of reaction mechanisms are included.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8211;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8211;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Trivalent Heteroglycoclusters as Focal Point Pseudoenantiomers: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of the first heteroglycoclusters featuring three distinct carbohydrate ligands. The obtained pair of stereoisomeric glycoclusters were named &#8220;focal point enantiomers&#8221;, as the configuration of the focal point is the only varying stereogenic element in these molecules. The first pair of such diastereomeric heteroglycoclusters was accessible by an efficient sequence of protection and sequential glycosylation steps utilizing a mannosyl, a N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyl, and a galactosyl donor, respectively, which was applied to a prototype azido&#8208;functionalized tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) scaffold molecule. The stereoisomers could be distinguished based on an X&#8208;ray structure of one of the isomeric key intermediates. As previously shown with divalent counterparts, such heterotrivalent cluster glycosides are useful tools for studying the fine&#8208;tuning of carbohydrate recognition. The azido functional group at the focal point of the synthetic scaffold molecule was employed in a conjugation reaction with a linker for further immobilization on a gold surface in order to fabricate glyco&#8208;SAMs (self&#8208;assembled monolayers). A preliminary biological evaluation of the focal point enantiomers was performed in solution using the well&#8208;known model lectin Concanavalin A and the important bacterial lectin FimH.</dc:description>

         <title>Saturated Heterocyclic Sulfamoyl Fluorides: Building Blocks for the SuFEx Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and cost&#8208;effective procedure for the direct fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines using SO2F2 in basic media is reported. The obtained sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx chemistry: they participated in transformations tolerating the SO2F functionality and reactions at the sulfur atom with O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A scalable protocol for direct SO2F2&#8208;based fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines is reported. The method is cost&#8208;effective and applicable for multigram preparation of structurally diverse compounds, as illustrated by the synthesis of 58 building blocks decorated with common functional groups. A comparison of overall yields of products demonstrates the advantages of the present method over alternative approaches. The obtained functionalized sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx (sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry. The synthetic utility of the synthesized building blocks was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage reactions tolerating the SO2F functionality as well as transformations to provide the corresponding sulfamide, sulfamate, and sulfonamide derivatives.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of an air&#8208;stable iridium pyrazolato complex as an effective catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols, employing borrowing hydrogen strategy. The alkylation reactions were efficiently conducted at 120 &#176;C in toluene utilizing a very low catalyst loading (0.1 mol%). A broad range of ketones and arylacetonitriles, in combination with various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols, were successfully transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkylated products. Additionally, quinoline derivatives were synthesized from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol and ketones using dehydrogenative coupling strategy. A mechanistic investigation unveiled that the key step involved alcohol activation via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanol&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Transformation of Benzonitriles to Five and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles: Synthesis and Mechanistic Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a facile methodology for the synthesis of heterocyclic molecules such as 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted imidazolines, oxazolines and 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrimidines, under one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free conditions. A series of electron&#8208;poor substituted benzonitriles were used as starting materials with different available diamines and amino alcohols, producing the desired products in good to high yields within methanol and in the absence of catalyst or additives. This methodology can be easily scaled up to laboratory size of 3 mmol for both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Detailed mechanistic and theoretical studies supported the dual role of methanolic media as solvent and as mediated agent. To shed light on the reaction mechanism, DFT mechanistic studies suggest a distinction in the first step, with the activation of the nitrile by methanol, and the formation of a benzimidamide and/or a benzimidate (observed by NMR) as intermediates. This facile synthetic procedure provides a green, metal&#8208;free, and mild protocol for the synthesis of a series of imidazoline, oxazoline and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The serendipitous rearrangement of an oxazole nucleus to a thiazoline ring under mild conditions is described. This transformation was achieved by a multicomponent reaction (MCR) featuring 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxazoles, thiosemicarbazide, and a carbonyl compound to provide oxazole&#8208;derived isothiosemicarbazones, which undergo oxazole ring&#8208;opening and recyclization to 2&#8208;hydrazono&#8208;3&#8208;thiazolines in a one&#8208;pot procedure.

         <title>S&#8208;Aryl substitution enhances acidity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre&#8208;catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity&#8208;enhancing effects of thio&#8208;substituents on carbon acidity are well&#8208;documented but not explored in the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)&#8208;H acidity. The direct attachment of S&#8208;aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (kDO) for C(5)&#8208;H deprotonation by DO&#8722; base that are 2.9&#8208;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium iodide in D2O solution. Protofugalities for the N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating N&#8208;alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre&#8208;catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substitution. Detailed X&#8208;ray structural data&#8208;protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the S&#8208;aryl substituent effect origins. C(5)&#8208;H pKa values (16.9&#8208;18.6) were calculated by utilisation of experimental protofugalities.</dc:description>

The acidity-enhancing effects of thio-substituents on carbon acidity are well-documented but not explored in the 1,2,4-triazolium scaffold.

         <title>Direct Introduction of Perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) Groups into Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct addition of perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) groups to organic frameworks has seen a resurgence in interest due to the benefits of these groups in late&#8208;stage modification of pro&#8208;drugs and biologically active compounds, helping to identify new active leads. The presence of &#8208;CORF groups positively impacts the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds. In that sense, both polar methods and radical catalytic protocols have been developed for the direct syntheses of trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl ketones. In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late&#8208;stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl&#8208;substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8208;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8208;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier&#8208;type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1&#8208;aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed.

     alt="Expanding 1-Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1-aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier-type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1-aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;-selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen-containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2-substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier-type 1-aminoglycoside compounds under activator-free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;-selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2-substitution (electron-withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1-aminoglycosides through this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>FeCl3 Catalyzed Synthesis of cis&#8208;Fused Reduced THC Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCl3 catalyzes the isomerization of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (cis&#8208;THC analogues). The same catalyst promotes the formation of these products via cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl substrates and citral/farnesal&#8208;type aldehydes. The synthetic strategy could be applied to the racemic preparation of biologically relevant natural products cis&#8208;perrottetinene and &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabiorcol.







Abstract
Studies on a cycloisomerization reaction of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (reduced cis&#8208;THC analogues) are reported. The transformation is catalyzed by iron chloride and proceeds with the formation of two new bonds and two stereocenters diastereoselectively. The same catalyst also promotes the formation of these products via a one&#8208;pot tandem Knoevenagel condensation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones and citral or farnesal aldehydes, followed by cycloisomerization establishing a direct assembly of this important scaffold.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Core&#8208;Modified Calixporphyrinoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structure, coordination, spectroscopic properties and applications of core&#8208;modified calix(n)phyrins that are resulted by replacing one or more pyrrole rings of calix(n)phyrins with different heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, phosphole, silole and so on and carbacycles such as m&#8208;/p&#8208;phenylene rings are described in this review.







Abstract
Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp2 and sp3 meso&#8208;carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as m/p&#8208;phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core&#8208;modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.

         <title>Room Temperature Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Ullmann Reaction of (Hetero)aryl/Vinyl Chlorides Enabled by Silylchloride&#8208;Activated Mn Powders</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;activation of Mn powers by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) enables a highly efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of (hetero)aryl/vinyl chlorides in DMA at room temperature to afford symmetrical biaryls/dienes in good to excellent yields although TMSCl plays a double&#8208;face role, activating Mn but deactivating Ni catalyst.







Abstract
A room temperature Ni&#8208;catalyzed Mn&#8208;mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre&#8208;activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between ortho&#8208;Cl and para&#8208;Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double&#8208;face role of TMSCl, i.&#8201;e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl&#8208;activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant. Applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in a multigram synthesis of Daclatasvir.

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zonisamide, an important anti&#8208;epileptic drug, was prepared with a new and convenient synthesis. This process involves the preparation of a key hydroxyiminosultone intermediate, whose stereochemistry was characterized by powder XRD, and a rearrangement reaction, whose mechanism was investigated with a combination of techniques (NMR, HRMS and kinetic profiles).







Abstract
Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31&#8201;% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Helicenes from Centrally Chiral Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes from centrally chiral precursors via central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chiral conversion or transfer strategies. It covers a broad spectrum of reactions, including Fischer indolization, Povarov reaction, Michael reaction, [3+2] and [2+2+2] cycloadditions, showcasing the versatility of these approaches in constructing enantioenriched helicenes.







Abstract
Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis. In this review article, described between 2012 and 2024, the approaches for the synthesis of chiral helicenes by chirality conversion or transfer from centrally chiral precursors are summarized.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Lactams: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched seven&#8208;membered lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of biologically active compounds and drugs. Significant progress has been achieved in this domain more recently. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral seven&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review are discussed one&#8208;pot domino/cascade/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for poly azacycles synthesis. Those are fused, bridged or spiranic depending on the position of the nucleophile. The mechanism of the two steps together with the stereochemical outcomes are detailed.







Abstract
Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.

A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity







Abstract
A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;position, as Michael acceptors.

These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane-1,3-dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;-position, as Michael acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Concise Ring Closing Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Preparation of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constrained C4&#8208;functionalized dipeptide derivatives incorporating a proline moiety were prepared in high yields by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) reaction. Post&#8208;functionalization studies of the newly introduced diene system pave the way for future applications in peptide synthesis, medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Herein we report the preparation of C4&#8208;functionalized proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane (Aba) amino acids by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis reaction of readily accessible dipeptide precursors. The reverse&#8208;turn inducing properties of the newly synthesized constrained dipeptide mimics were assessed by computational studies. Furthermore, the desired Aba derivatives, carrying a synthetically versatile diene moiety, were subjected to post&#8208;functionalization reactions to validate their potential application in peptide/peptidomimetic chemistry and drug discovery.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <title>Non&#8208;Reductive CO2 Valorization into Oxazolidinones via Cycloaddition to Aziridines: A Personal Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides an overview of recent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies published on the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to form oxazolidinones, with a particular attention to the employed experimental conditions, which are essential parameters for envisioning real costs and possible applications of these synthetic processes.







Abstract
This perspective discusses bibliography data that has been published since 2018 on the synthesis of oxazolidinones by reacting corresponding aziridines with CO2. The versatility and viability of various procedures have been analyzed by considering the variety of tested substrates as well as experimental conditions and catalytic systems used. Collected data highlights that the reaction can be effectively promoted by several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems that have been optimized in order to conjugate the process sustainability and productivity with convenient procedural costs.

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8722;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryl N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;Protected Diamines via Organocatalytic Arylation of 5&#8208;Aminoisoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.
