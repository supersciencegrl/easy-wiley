      <title>Biomedical Hydrogels Fabricated Using Diels Alder Crosslinking</title>
      <dc:description>The Diels Alder (DA) cycloaddition is one of the best methods for biomaterials conjugation to generate tools for biomedical applications. It is a biocompatible one&#8208;step reaction, exploiting functional groups absent in natural biopolymers, doesn&#8217;t require catalysts and doesn&#8217;t generate side products, an ideal &#8220;click reaction&#8221;. In this review we provide an overview on the recent examples in which the DA cycloaddition has been exploited in nanomedicine. Nanoparticles for drug delivery or diagnosis, and nanostructured biomaterials for regenerative medicine, have been efficiently generated exploiting the DA reaction to crosslink the polymeric components, in order to obtain nanoparticles or scaffolds with the required chemical and morphological properties, and to conjugate targeting agents or signalling molecules</dc:description>

      <title>Symmetrical Tertiary Amines: Applications and Synthetic Approaches</title>
      <dc:description>Tertiary amines represent a key class of organic molecules with multiple industrial, synthetical, and analytical applications. The focus of this review is different approaches towards the synthesis of the C  3  and C  3V  symmetrical tertiary amines. Generally, symmetrical tertiary amines could be prepared  via  N&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides and alcohols, reductive amination, desamination, hydroamination of olefins, and different kinds of C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. All reactions leading to the titled structures are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are provided.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence for &#8220;Halogen&#8208;Dance&#8221; and Ring&#8208;Exchange Reactions in Chloro&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ferrocenes</title>
      <dc:description>The pentachloroferrocenes [C5Cl5]Fe[C5H4X] (X= H, Br, SMe) react with LiTMP and MeSSMe to mixtures of compounds, that contain besides the expected products of deprotonation also one ormore complexes with a [C5Cl4(SMe)] ligand. This latter observation makes the otherwise rarely observed occurrence of &#8220;halogen dance reactions&#8221; in chloroaromatics very probable. 1,2,3&#8208;Trichloroferrocene yields with BuLi and MeSSMe products both of halogen&#8208;metal&#8208;exchange reactions and of deprotonation. Additionally, in all examined systems, the observation of some highly&#8208;substituted complexes with eight or more substituents hints to the involvement of cyclopentadienyl exchange reactions, which has also rarely been observed under such mild conditions. The molecular structures of [C5Cl4(SMe)]Fe[C5H3BrX] (X= SMe or SOMe), [C5Cl4(SMe)]Fe[C5H2Cl(SMe)2], [C5Cl2(SMe)3]2Fe and [C5HCl3(SMe)]2Fe have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction</dc:description>

The molecular structures of [C5Cl4(SMe)]Fe[C5H3BrX] (X= SMe or SOMe), [C5Cl4(SMe)]Fe[C5H2Cl(SMe)2], [C5Cl2(SMe)3]2Fe and [C5HCl3(SMe)]2Fe have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tetrabromomethane as an Organic Catalyst: a Kinetic Study of CBr4&#8208;Catalyzed Schiff Condensation</title>
      <dc:description>Tetrabromomethane functions as an organic catalyst for non&#8208;redox reactions of carbonyl species and, in particular, it enhances the aldehyde&#8211;acyl hydrazide condensation to give  N  &#8208;acyl hydrazones. This simple, inexpensive, and commercially available halomethane provides up to 14&#8208;fold acceleration of the Schiff reaction; the kinetic data indicate that the studied condensation exhibits the first order on CBr  4  . The catalytic activity of CBr  4  is significantly higher than the activity of other halogen&#8208;containing species, such as CHX  3  or ArX (X = Cl, Br, I).</dc:description>

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

      <title>Isobenzofurans as Synthetic Intermediates: Synthesis and Biological Activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Ajudazol B.</title>
      <dc:description>Ajudazol B is a polyketide secondary metabolite, isolated from the myxobacterium  Chondromyces crocatus  , that exhibits potent biological activity. Here we report a convergent total synthesis of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B. The key step is a regio&#8208;selective alkylation and oxidative rearrangement of a reactive isobenzofuran intermediate that generates the isochromanone core. This approach provides a fast and efficient method to synthesise analogues of ajudazol B from simple aldehydes, allowing assessment of structure&#8208;activity relationships. The antifungal activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B as well as that of related analogues has been assessed using  Botrytis cinerea  . The results indicate that the isochromanone unit is key for antifungal activity.</dc:description>

  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp.

  This minireview covers the know literature on [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of activated methylene isocyanides published since 2015. The review is divided into the three major parts that refer to the three heterocycles which can be prepared by reactions of isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  This review is devoted to the recent advances in the chemistry of methylene isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds. In this paper, we show a variety of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions for isocyanides, carried out both under catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic conditions. In addition, we also focused on diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity data.

      <title>A new phenanthroline ligand and the spontaneous resolution of its homoleptic copper(I) complex</title>
      <dc:description>During the synthesis of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives sterically hindered in the 2 and/or 9 positions, serendipity led to the discovery of a new substitution pattern on phenanthroline with good and reproducible yields. When toluene was used as a solvent and the aryl&#8208;lithio reagents generated with tBuLi, after a first substitution at the 2 position, a benzyl substituent was regioselectively introduced at the 7 position. It is proposed that the benzyllithium reagent is formed by reaction with the solvent and that the steric hindrance on the intermediates controls the nucleophilic addition.

      <title>Conformational lock of glycosyl donors using cyclic carbamates.</title>
      <dc:description>Axial rich glycosyl donors often display superior reactivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylations. In this study, a glucosamine glycosyl donor locked in a  1  C  4  conformation using a six&#8208;membered carbamate ring, i.e. an oxazinone, is synthesized and studied. The 2  N  ,4  O  carbamate is synthesized in one step from the corresponding azide. The glycosylation properties was studied by glycosylating different alcohols. Derivatives of the glycosyl donor were synthesized by introducing Ac, Troc, Ts and Ms groups on the oxazinone nitrogen. The ring opening to give the glycoside in the  4  C  1  conformation was found to proceed smoothly using Zempl&#233;n conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Harzialactone A and Its Three Stereoisomers by Use of Standardized Polyketide Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
  The Harzialactone A synthesis utilizes a Horner&#8211;Wittig&#8208;reaction of the chiral building block and benzaldehyde in the first step. The formed &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone can be selectively transformed into the syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;diol, which is further converted into the desired natural compound by ozonolysis, cyclization and oxidation in one step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this paper, we present a short and convenient synthesis of the natural product Harzialactone A and its three stereoisomers. In a three&#8208;step synthesis starting from cheap and commercially available benzaldehyde, we created the small polyketidic compound with full control over its two stereogenic centers. To this end, we employed a chiral building block previously described by us, introducing the first stereogenic center through a Horner&#8211;Wittig reaction. The second stereogenic center was installed via stereocontrolled syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;reduction with the corresponding &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone intermediates. Upon ozonolysis followed by oxidation the natural product and its stereovariants were produced with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereopurities.

  &lt;p&gt;The Harzialactone A synthesis utilizes a Horner&#8211;Wittig&#8208;reaction of the chiral building block and benzaldehyde in the first step. The formed &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone can be selectively transformed into the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; or &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diol, which is further converted into the desired natural compound by ozonolysis, cyclization and oxidation in one step.

      <title>Calcium carbide: versatile synthetic applications, green methodology and sustainability</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.
