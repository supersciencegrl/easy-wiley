         <title>Base Promoted Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones Fused with Medium&#8208;Sized Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple protocol for the synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolone derivatives via base&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage reaction of cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters under mild reaction conditions has been developed.







Abstract
In the presence of cesium carbonate, ynones bearing an ortho&#8208;amino group reacted with cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters through conjugated addition/carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage/nucleophilic aromatic substitution tandem reaction to obtain 4&#8208;quinolones fused with medium&#8208;sized rings in good yields. This is the first example of synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolones through base&#8208;promoted insertion reactions of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bonds into carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bonds. Notable features of this program are mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Penta&#8208; and Tetrasubstituted Quercetins and Their Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quercetin contains five hydroxy groups (OH) at positions 3, 5, 7, 3', and 4'. The selective reaction of a hydroxy group in quercetin is an important strategy for the modulation of various properties of the derivatives. Herein, we report the synthesis of selective quercetin derivatives, wherein the oligoether chains were linked to the hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, the penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than the tetra&#8208;substituted one. The fluorescence behavior of synthetic derivatives was investigated using solvatochromism, molecular aggregations, computational calculations, and hydrogen bonds with solvents. The fluorescent penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative did not show any cytotoxicity up to 600 &#181;M concentration, showing a novel biocompatible fluorescent molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Mechanism and Origin of Stereoselectivity in the Fluorination and Trifluoromethylthiolation of 2&#8208;Bromoamides with AgF and AgSCF3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with AgF readily gave the corresponding 2&#8208;fluorinated amide with retention of configuration. The mechanism and origin of the stereochemistry were rationalised using density functional theory calculations, which suggested a double&#8208;inversion pathway via the formation of an aziridinone intermediate. The computed reaction pathway is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the stereochemistry in base&#8208;promoted trifluoromethylthiolation of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides using AgSCF3 was examined. The experimental results showed that the reaction proceeds through the generation of a neutral aziridinone intermediate, following the attack of a trifluoromethylthiolate anion at C&#8208;3. The stereoselectivity of C&#8208;3 attack on the aziridinone depended on the steric bulk of substitutes on the &#945;&#8208;position and nitrogen of the amide. The study results show the potential utility of AgF and AgSCF3 in the synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;functionalized amide derivatives and provide mechanistic insights for nucleophilic substitution of 2&#8208;bromoamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Oligomerization of Arylallenes and Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it was shown that Piers&#8217; borane [HB(C6F5)2]2 can induce rapid oligomerization reactions of arylacetylenes and arylallenes. Using phenylallene PhCH=C=CH2 and phenylacetylene PhC&#8801;CH as typical substrates, the detailed mechanisms of borane&#8208;induced oligomerization are disclosed by extensive state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations. Following initial regio&#8208;selective hydroboration of unsaturated C=C or C&#8801;C bonds, further oligomerization and structural rearrangement reactions may occur via unique boryl&#8208;enabled conversions such as 1,3&#8208;boryl&#8208;shift, allylboration, 1,2&#8208;carboboration, and 1,5&#8208;electrocyclization. Together with stepwise transborylation with hydroboranes such as pinacolborane HBpin, such fundamental reactions may pave a catalytic way to borane&#8208;induced oligomerization of arylacetylenes and arylallenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Studies on the Tropylium&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylic Acid O&#8208;H Insertion with Diazoesters: The Role of Homoaromaticity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tropylium&#8208;catalyzed carboxylic acid O&#8208;H insertion with diazoesters was reported to provide &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters through an activated carbene intermediate. This study presents a revised mechanism based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations involving a unique homoaromatic intermediate formed between the tropylium ion and the diazoester. The calculated energies of the intermediates and transition states support this revised mechanism. Our computational model explains the tropylium ion's binding to the diazoester, resulting in the homoaromatic intermediate. By comparing the reaction profiles of four different pathways, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and have potential implications for designing more efficient catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Outer Membrane Vesicles Bearing Tn Antigen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;thio glycolipids (TGL) are proposed as fundamental components in the production of synthetic outer membrane vesicles (S&#8208;OMVs). A small but representative library of glycolipids was prepared by thiol&#8208;ene coupling (TEC), using unprotected thiols in acceptable to good yields (63&#8208;96%). Multilamellar giant vesicles (GVs) of varying sizes were assembled from mixtures of TGL and 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;oleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (POPC). Our results mark an important advancement for the development of synthetic anticancer vaccines, supramolecular adjuvants and drug delivery systems based on glycolipid/phospholipid formulations (10 % mol/mol in 0.1 mm solution).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Substituted Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones through Ag(I) Catalyzed Cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones</title>

         <dc:description>
Ag(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones afforded pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones in excellent yields. The core of these compounds is formed by fusion of quinolone and pyrrolone moieties, and the method gives easy access to a new class of therapeutically relevant compounds for anticancer and antibacterial drug discovery efforts.







Abstract
An efficient synthetic route to access highly substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones in which the core is formed by fusion of quinolone and pyrrolone moieties is discussed. The method involves Ag(I) catalyzed cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones which in turn may be accessed from kynurenic acid derivatives through Weinreb amide intermediate, followed by alkyne addition. Studies involving substrates with different substitution pattern revealed that factors increasing the nucleophilicity of quinoline nitrogen or Lewis acid&#8208;coordination of the ynone unit gives high yields in short reaction times. It was possible to execute tandem cyclization&#8208;arylation sequence by using Pd(II) generated by oxidative addition of Pd(0) with aryl iodide as the electrophilic species to get substitution pattern as seen in Discoipyrrole A.

         <title>Synthesis of Defective Wheel&#8208;Shaped Nanographdiynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes incorporating butadiyne&#8208;bridged metacyclophanes with para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene units as the axis were synthesized to study the structure and properties of GDY with defects. The optical properties of these graphdiyne substructures can be tuned through the variation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and quantity of the para axis, especially the fusion of adjacent dehydrobenzo [18] annulenes.







Abstract
The synthesis and optical properties of wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes that has lost some butadiyne spokes were reported. These defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes possess butadiyne&#8208;bridged metacyclophanes with para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene units as the axis. The optimized geometries of the defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes along with their vibrational spectra, HOMO and LUMO orbitals were calculated at B3LYP/6&#8208;311G(d,p) level. HOMO and LUMO orbitals are delocalized mainly over the para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene axis, with weak contribution from the attached ethynyl units. The &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and quantity increase of the para axis influenced the optical properties of these graphdiyne substructures, leading to the change of bandgap from 2.88&#8197;eV to 2.56&#8197;eV as reflected by optical spectroscopy. The defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes lost the characteristic intensive sharp absorption peak at low energy region, which indicated that the fusion of adjacent dehydrobenzo [18] annulenes are crucial for the bulk properties of graphdiyne.

The methodology uses very low catalyst loading under moderate heating to achieve the construction of a wide range of propargylamines in good to excellent yields in very short reaction times. Challenging substrates, including acyclic linear ketones, aromatic ketones, and electron&#8208;poor aromatic alkynes, as well as substrates bearing synthetically valuable functionalities, are well tolerated.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional coatings hinging on the catechol/amine interplay</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and implementation of functional coatings is a topic of active research in a variety of health&#8208;related applications, most of which require wet adhesion. The powerful wet adhesion of mussel byssus proteins rich in DOPA and lysine residues provided a clue to realize that the combination of a catechol and an amine component has a specific role in the interfacial adhesion. From this natural model, polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;based coatings have been developed that result from the oxidative polymerization of dopamine combining the catechol and amine functionalities in the same molecule. Covalent interactions resulting from Michael&#8208;type addition or Schiff&#8208;base formation of the polymeric products from dopamine oxidation as well as non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;stacking and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions exemplify the diverse mode of catechol/amine interplay that have been identified as responsible of the adhesion and cohesion properties of PDA. In the last decade coatings inspired to the same chemistry but using different starting materials have been explored particularly catechols of natural origin and different amine components, while mechanistic studies with model compounds have allowed to rationalize the structural requirements for adhesion and to expand the potential of these functional coatings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alkenes serve as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. However, the challenge of achieving single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes persists. In recent years, photocatalysis has emerged as a promising and efficient tool for accomplishing the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes. Given the potential benefits that can be derived from photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes, including the development of potent catalytic systems to enable diverse alkene difunctionalization reactions, it is necessary to provide a conceptual understanding of this emerging field. Hence, we present an overview of current synthetic techniques for photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes.</dc:description>

An asymmetric protocol for the syntheses of novel &#948;&#8208;lactams by utilizing a synergistic chiral isothiourea/achiral Pd&#8208;catalyst combination for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of activated aryl esters followed by deprotection/cyclization has been successfully established.







Abstract
We herein report a two&#8208;step approach for the enantioselective synthesis of novel chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams. By using a cooperative chiral ITU/achiral Pd&#8208;catalyst system, this protocol proceeds via an asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of activated aryl esters first, followed by an acid&#8208;mediated lactam formation. A variety of differently substituted products could be obtained with usually high levels of enantioselectivities and in reasonable yields (16 examples, up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er and 73&#8201;% yield over two steps). In addition, further utilizations of the products via transformations of the exocyclic double bond were successfully carried out as well.

         <title>Exhaustive Reduction of Esters, Carboxylic Acids and Carbamates to Methyl Groups Catalyzed by Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;step reduction of carboxy groups to methyl groups commonly used in organic synthesis is simplified by a new metal&#8208;free catalyst system. It uses boronic acids to catalyze the single&#8208;step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids and carbamates to methyl groups. High&#8208;yield, multifunctional product formation is achieved under mild conditions using ammonia borane as the hydrogen donor.







Abstract
Carboxy to methyl reduction is an important transformation in organic synthesis, yet existing methodologies often require multi&#8208;step procedures or use hazardous metal hydrides. Herein, a metal&#8208;free catalytic system is reported for the one&#8208;step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids, and carbamates to a methyl group, in the presence of catalytic amounts of boronic acids. By using ammonia borane as a hydrogen donor, a wide range of products bearing different functional groups can be obtained in high yields under relatively mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments elucidate the complexity of the mechanism and provide an explanation for the observed selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The multi-step reduction of carboxy groups to methyl groups commonly used in organic synthesis is simplified by a new metal-free catalyst system. It uses boronic acids to catalyze the single-step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids and carbamates to methyl groups. High-yield, multifunctional product formation is achieved under mild conditions using ammonia borane as the hydrogen donor.

Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates with pyrazolinone&#8208;derived ketimines gave a variety of functionalized spirodihydropyrrole&#8208;dihydropyrazolones in moderate to high yields with good diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates with pyrazolinone&#8208;derived ketimines has been achieved to give various spirodihydropyrrole&#8208;dihydropyrazolones in moderate to high yields with good diastereoselectivities. The reaction tolerated diverse MBH carbonates and ketimines. Both scale&#8208;up reaction and further transformation of the product were successfully performed. In addition, up to 98&#8201;% ee of chiral product was obtained with the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine.

         <dc:description>5&#8208;N,N&#8208;Diarylaminothiazoles containing cyano and nitro groups were synthesized using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination reaction with good yields. The cyano group in the resultant thiazole was reduced to a formyl group. This was then subjected to the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, leading to the formation of a thiazole with a dicyanovinyl group. The nitro group in the thiazole was reduced to an amino group, which was subsequently reacted with triphosgene, yielding a thiazole with an isocyanate group. These thiazoles, with their electron&#8208;accepting properties, demonstrated absorption and emission spectra at longer wavelengths. Notably, the thiazole containing the dicyanovinyl group displayed a red emission. Tests for the detection of hydrazine hydrate, a hazardous volatile organic compound, were conducted using the synthesized thiazoles. The results showed that the dicyanovinyl group effectively responded to hydrazine hydrate, evidenced by changes in the emission spectra.&#160;This change in color was also visibly detectable to the naked eye.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones are a hitherto very poorly studied class of sulfur heterocycles some of which have been shown to be important precursors for HIV drugs or bioactive, anticarcinogenic compounds. We have developed a novel and effective process for the direct generation of this structural motif in a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The cycloadducts were obtained with complete regioselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield. The heterocyclic motif was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel protocol for the direct synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones based on the (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The products were obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction within short reaction times and in typically very good yields. The product structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation Total Synthesis of the Pigment Aurantricholone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously, 6,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;ketoketals&#8221;) gained by ring&#8208;closing metatheses (&#8220;RCMs&#8221;) gave 6&#8208;hydroxybenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;benzotropolones&#8221;) by hydrolyses with 10&#8197;equiv. of hot TsOH. Now, an RCM&#8208;based ketoketal allowed to reach the benzotropolone aurantricholone by total synthesis for the second time and to avoid a forcing hydrolysis. Another key to success was establishing the pulvinone(&#8722;like) motifs by our recently developed Suzuki strategy.







Abstract
Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring&#8208;enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8208; step 9 overall &#8208; engaged this motif in a &#946;&#8208;elimination of ROH rather than in a hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O&#8208;methyl 4&#8208;methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O&#8208;methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et&#8197;al. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr3/CH2Cl2 (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 co&#8208;crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

Now, an RCM-based ketoketal allowed to reach the benzotropolone aurantricholone by total synthesis for the second time &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to avoid a forcing hydrolysis. Another key to success was establishing the pulvinone(&#8722;like) motifs by our recently developed Suzuki strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring-enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation - step 9 overall - engaged this motif in a &#946;-elimination of ROH rather than in a hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl 4-methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 co-crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X-ray structure analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles bearing the Emerging Fluorinated Group &#8722;OCF2H is herein disclosed. Various difluoromethoxylated pyrazoles, isoxazoles, pyrimidines and indoles were thus quickly and easily obtained. These new structures of high value were accessed from simple &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented synthesis of difluoromethoxylated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks. Pyrazoles, isoxazoles and pyrimidines could be obtained via an enaminone intermediate, whereas in the direct reaction of &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones with arylhydrazines, a Fischer indole synthesis was achieved. All these scaffolds, which are uncommon, or even sometimes novel, due to the directly attached emerging fluorinated group (EFG) &#8722;OCF2H, might be of high potential in life sciences and appear as an interesting alternative to more and more controversial classical fluorinated groups, such as the ubiquitous trifluoromethyl group.

         <title>An Unexpected Synthesis of Crowded Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene dioxide with two equivalents of tetracyclone yields a heptaphenyl triphenylene, presumably by double Diels&#8208;Alder addition followed by fragmentation and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.







Abstract
In attempts to make octaphenyldibenzofuran (7) and octaphenyldibenzothiophene (8), 2,5&#8208;dibromofuran (4) and 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene (5), respectively, were heated with tetracyclone (2) under forcing conditions, but only single addition products, such as 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzofuran (10) and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzothiophene (12) were observed. However, when 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide (6) was heated with tetracyclone, the chief product was 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyltriphenylene (14). Similarly, when compound 6 was heated with acecyclone (15), the product was 11,18,20&#8208;triphenyldiacenaphtho[a,h]triphenylene (16). Both 14 and 16 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. They are proposed to form from double Diels&#8208;Alder addition products of the cyclopentadienones by extrusion of sulfur dioxide and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.

         <title>2&#8208;(o&#8208;Tolyl) Pyridine as Ligand Improves the Efficiency in Ketone Directed ortho&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we explore how adding a catalytic amount of an NC&#8208;type ligand improves ketone&#8208;directed ortho C&#8722;H arylation, whereas a full equivalent shuts down the transformation. Increased catalytic activity stems from the formation of a cyclometallated complex containing the NC&#8208;type ligand to provide an intermediate which accelerates the ortho&#8208;arylation of the ketone substrate.







Abstract
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ketone directed ortho&#8208;arylation wherein the addition of a bidentate NC&#8208;type ligand, most effectively 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine, significantly enhances the C&#8722;H arylation reaction. Various aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones, including cyclic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ones, are competent substrates, and arylboronic acid esters were used as aryl sources. However, substitution with OMe and CF3 in the aromatic ring of the ketone substrates is not tolerated, while such residues on the benzoic ester are possible. Notably, this study provides valuable insights into ketone&#8208;directed ortho arylation in the presence of 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine and adds additional options for catalyst and ligand optimization in ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <dc:description>
A direct protocol for the facile construction of axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives via the catalytic asymmetric iodocyclization of indole moiety linked alkynes, using stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex as the catalyst, has been developed. A range of versatile axially chiral iodobenzocarbazoles were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% ee under mild conditions.







Abstract
A new synthetic approach to novel axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives based on the highly enantioselective intramolecular iodoarylation of linked alkyne&#8208;indole systems was developed by using the versatile chiral catalyst, stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex, through an axially chiral iodinated vinylidene o&#8208;quinone methide (IVQM) intermediate. This protocol provides 21 examples in excellent yields with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield, 98&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, the introduced iodine atoms can easily be converted into other functional groups.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Rigid&#8208;Featured Tertiary Amine&#8208;Derived C2&#8208;Symmetric Chiral Furan&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide Ligands</title>

Newly developed rigid&#8208;featured chiral Fu&#8208;2NO ligands possesses two pyrroloimidazolone&#8208;based N&#8208;oxides as non&#8208;flat chiral walls, and afforded the opportunity for fine&#8208;tuning the ligand's electronic and conformational properties by judicious choice of the substituent in the nonligating nitrogen atom.







Abstract
To expand the chemical space of chiral N&#8208;oxides and chiral furan&#8208;containing ligands, herein we designed and synthesized a new class of rigid&#8208;featured tertiary amine&#8208;derived C2&#8208;symmetric chiral furan&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide (Fu&#8208;2NO) ligands from optically pure l&#8208;prolinamides/hydroxylprolinamides in operationally simple two steps and up to 57&#8201;% overall yield. The newly developed rigid&#8208;featured chiral Fu&#8208;2NO ligands possesses two pyrroloimidazolone&#8208;based N&#8208;oxides as non&#8208;flat chiral walls, and afforded the opportunity for fine&#8208;tuning the ligand electronic and conformational properties by judicious choice of the substituent in the nonligating nitrogen atom. More importantly, The Fu&#8208;2NO ligands can tolerate air and moisture such that no special handling is needed for their storage, and can be applied in the Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction of indole.

         <title>Formal Radical Deoxyfluorination of Oxalate&#8208;Activated Alcohols Triggered by the Selectfluor&#8208;DMAP Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex</title>

In this work, a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols is reported.







Abstract
We present a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols. The method relies on the spontaneous generation of the N&#8208;(chloromethyl)triethylenediamine radical dication, a potent single electron oxidant, from Selectfluor and 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine. The protocol is easily scalable and provides the desired fluorinated products within only a few minutes reaction time.

This concise protocol provided easy access to the &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alkyl ethers, alcohol and fluorides with good yields and excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the four&#8208;component &#8220;SO2&#8221; insertion reaction also worked efficiently to produce the &#945;&#8208;CF3, &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl ethers in moderate to good yields. A radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling pathway was proposed for the C&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free, visible light&#8208;induced difunctionalizations of &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes with aryl diazonium salts and various hetero nucleophiles (ROH, H2O, N3&#8722; and F&#8722;) are described. This concise protocol provided easy access to the &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alkyl ethers, alcohol and fluorides with good yields and excellent functional group tolerance.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the potential of difluoromethoxylated ketones as building blocks for accessing challenging structures bearing the key OCF2H motif. These are represented here by a rocket, a highly technical achievement. Obviously, a parallel can be drawn between the building block strategy and a famous construction game. On the righthand side of the cover we can see the rocket heading towards a cell, highlighting the importance of fluorinated molecules in life sciences. Cover design by A. Loison. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Panossian, F. R. Leroux et&#8197;al.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Molecules: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherent chirality represents a distinct form of molecular chirality that does not fit into the four traditional types of molecular chiral elements, which has been observed in a diverse range of molecular structures. This review summarizes the recent advances in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral molecules, including chiral calixarenes, saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycles, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes and others.







Abstract
Inherent chirality represents a distinct category of molecular chirality that does not fall within the traditional classification of four chiral elements: central, axial, planar, and helical chirality. While extensive research has been conducted on the catalytic enantioselective construction of these conventional chiralities, the corresponding synthesis of inherently chiral molecules has remained largely unexplored. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in this field, focusing on the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of inherently chiral calixarenes, saddle&#8208;shaped tetraphenylenes and their heterocycle derivatives, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes and chiral multilayer 3D frameworks, as well as our perspective in this field.

         <title>Strategies for the Controlled Hydrostannylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 42, November 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarises recent advances in approaches to the synthesis of important vinyl stannane building blocks in a stereocontrolled and regiocontrolled manner. Particular emphasis is put on those routes in which judicious choice of ligand affords a switchable reaction, providing routes to stereodefined olefins from a single starting material.







Abstract
Organostannanes have represented one of the most widely applied reagents in modern cross&#8208;coupling chemistry and represent a key reagent in the synthesis of a range of pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds. This Concept article reviews recent advances in approaches to the synthesis of these building blocks in a stereocontrolled and regiocontrolled manner. Particular focus is paid to methods which allow for divergent synthesis of alkenylstannanes and developments in methods which present opportunities for sustainable synthesis.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;regioselective (2+4) cycloaddition of propargylic esters with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl substituted secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) was established, which afforded phosphorus&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles in high yields.

         <title>2&#8208;Hydroxypyridines as N&#8208; and O&#8208;Nucleophiles in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Hydroxypyridines have emerged as versatile nucleophiles in organic synthesis. The N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines affords straightforward and practical methods for the construction of N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and O&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines, which are important structural motifs in numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Nonetheless, the competition between N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines presents an inevitable and formidable challenge.

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Aspidofractinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fascinating structural features and potential biological activities of aspidofractinine monoterpenoid indole alkaloids grasped the attention of the synthetic community since 1964. Aspidofractinine also serves as the primary structural component to over 200 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, in which most of these alkaloids' total synthesis has been unexplored. In light of these facts, studies on the synthetic strategies towards the complex, intriguing carbon skeleton of aspidofractinine have high implications. The intensive studies on the total synthesis of aspidofractinine alkaloids have resulted in numerous elegant strategies to construct the highly substituted hexacyclic core structure containing bicyclo[2.2.2]octane motif and three all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. This review discusses all reported strategies for synthesizing aspidofractinine, and aspidofractinine&#8208;like alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Pyridine/Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides with Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We achieved metal&#8208;free pyridine arylations via O&#8208;triflated pyridine N&#8208;oxides and N&#8208;alkylated indoles. The reactions proceeded through reactive intermediates, obtained upon treatment of pyridine N&#8208;oxides with Tf2O, which were sufficiently activated for preferentially installing various indoles at the nitrogen&#8208;adjacent positions of pyridine. This protocol features mild conditions, short reaction times, and ease of handling under stirring and air at room temperature. Furthermore, no transition metal is required, which renders our procedure an environmentally benign approach to pyridine arylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Carbon Electrophile Addition to Carbonyls and Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed additions of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls, imines and carboxylic acid derivatives are reviewed. The review is organized based on the nature of the reductant used for generation of the active low&#8208;valent Co&#8208;species: chemical and photochemical reduction strategies. The mechanistic aspects of the strategies are also summarized.







Abstract
The addition of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls and imines has emerged as a valuable strategy for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. The merger of this concept with sustainable cobalt catalysis has yielded numerous innovative methodologies. Remarkable functional group tolerance and selectivity have been observed in many cases, providing reliable methods for bond construction. The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed additions of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls, imines and carboxylic acid derivatives described in this review include the earliest reports, such as Takai&#8208;Utimoto Co/Cr co&#8208;catalyzed additions and their progression, as well as modern variants, exemplified by recent Co/photoredox co&#8208;catalyzed protocols. The systematic appraisal of this modern strategy provides a clearer perspective and inspiration for its further development.

         <title>28&#960; Non&#8208;Fused Hexaphyrin: Synthesis, Protonation Triggered M&#246;bius Aromaticity and Structural Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a 28&#960; non&#8208;fused core&#8208;modified E&#8208;hexaphyrin is reported. An interesting transformation was observed, wherein the initially non&#8208;aromatic structure of the macrocycle was converted into an aromatic structure through the introduction of a proton to the imine nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Synthesis of core&#8208;modified 28&#960; non&#8208;fused hexaphyrin is reported. The optical and 1H&#8197;NMR spectral analysis reveals the non&#8208;aromatic nature of the macrocycle in its freebase form at 298&#8197;K. However, the non&#8208;aromatic nature of the macrocycle remains unaltered upon lowering the temperature. The structural elucidations for the freebase macrocycle also justify the non&#8208;aromaticity of the freebase 8, where the thiophene units of the 1,2 diphenyl 1,2 dithienyl ethene moiety is deviated maximum from the overall macrocyclic framework. Protonation on the imino pyrrolic nitrogens results in single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of 8 which show essential distortion in macrocyclic framework needed for the effective &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, attaining M&#246;bius aromaticity. The Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values for the freebase and protonated macrocycles are &#8722;2.0&#8197;ppm and &#8722;5.6&#8197;ppm. The Anisotropy Induced Current density shows the clockwise delocalization of current density vectors. Overall, the spectral, structural and theoretical analysis suggests nonaromatic in freebase and M&#246;bius aromatic nature of the protonated hexaphyrin.

         <title>A New Strategy for the Preparation of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic Acid, an Unusual &#947;&#8208;Amino Acid found in Microsclerodermins</title>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid appears in the structures of the microsclerodermin natural product family and represents a challenging synthetic target, due to the ease with which it can dehydrate. We describe a successful strategy for the creation of this unusual &#947;&#8208;amino acid in a model dipeptide, through liberation of a ketone from a dithiolane precursor followed by facile cyclization in mild conditions.







Abstract
An original synthetic strategy is presented for the preparation of the sensitive 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid residue that is present in the structures of the microsclerodermin natural product family. The approach relies on the use of a linear &#947;&#8208;amino acid surrogate, derived from asparagine, bearing a &#946;&#8208;dithiolanyl group. A protected dipeptide model system is used to demonstrate that selective removal of the dithioketal protection followed by cyclization gives the target structure in single diastereoisomer form and with little or no dehydration.

A ring closing enyne metathesis for the synthesis of a series of unsaturated cyclic sulfones is described. The reaction proceeds most effectively with the N&#8208;heterocyclic ruthenium carbene catalysts and the rate of reaction depends on the identity of the alkynyl substituent.







Abstract
Studies into the ring&#8208;closing enyne metathesis of a series of nine sulfone containing enynes is described. The readily accessible sulfone substrates were shown to undergo cyclisation to form 3&#8208;subsituted 2,5&#8208;dihydrothiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxides (sulfolenes) and one 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyran 1,1&#8208;dioxide. The success of this process depended on the substrate's substitution pattern. Moderate to good yields of the products were obtained when the ene component was monosubstituted and it was found that the reactions proceeded most efficiently using the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts, at elevated temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;A ring closing enyne metathesis for the synthesis of a series of unsaturated cyclic sulfones is described. The reaction proceeds most effectively with the N-heterocyclic ruthenium carbene catalysts and the rate of reaction depends on the identity of the alkynyl substituent.

A novel acyl group: 5&#8208;ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) group was developed. Amv group was generated by conversion of acryloyl group through decatungstate&#8208;catalyzed addition of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of i&#8208;BuNH2&#8901;HCl under the irradiation of UV light and can be removed by the treatment with a base. Based on this method, the selective removal of acryloyl groups through Amv groups in the presence of another acetyl or benzoyl group was demonstrated.







Abstract
The 5&#8208;ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) group was generated by conversion of acryloyl group through decatungstate&#8208;catalyzed addition of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of i&#8208;BuNH2&#8901;HCl under the irradiation of UV light (365&#8197;nm or 405&#8197;nm). Treatment of Amv&#8208;protected alcohols and anilines with aqueous Na2CO3 promoted the efficient deprotection of Amv. This is a unique method for the efficient removal of acryloyl groups from phenols, alcohols, and anilines. The selective removal of acryloyl groups through Amv in the presence of another acetyl or benzoyl group was demonstrated. The base&#8208;triggered intramolecular cyclization of Amv was monitored by the release of a fluorescent molecule, and it was found that cyclization by Na2CO3 was very rapid (within 1&#8197;min) and that some weak bases such as 2,6&#8208;lutidine are sufficient to promote cyclization.

         <title>Hybrid Steroid&#8208;[60]Fullerene as n&#8208;Type Material for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene derivatives have been used as electron acceptor and transport materials in organic photovoltaics as well as in perovskite solar cells. Among them, [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been one of the most widely used, in combination with poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (P3HT) as an electron donor semiconducting polymer, for the fabrication of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. In this work, a steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid was synthesized through the Bingel&#8211;Hirsch reaction to compare its properties with PC61BM as the reference structure. Different analytical, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques were employed to characterize the new fullerene derivative. The characterization was completed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which explore the hybrid's morphology in aqueous solution, where the presence of the steroid moiety increases the solubility of the fullerene material. DFT/PBE&#8208;D3(BJ)/6&#8208;311G(d,p) calculations for both the steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid and PC61BM allowed to obtain geometry optimizations and electronic structure data. A comparative study to analyze the nature of the electronic properties of the synthesized steroid&#8208;[60]fullerene hybrid and PC61BM with an oligomer of ten thiophene units, used in the active layer of organic solar cells, was carried out. Electron density maps using the [CIS|CNDOL/21] approach illustrate the photoexcitation of the donor followed by an electron&#8208;charge transfer to the acceptor fullerene.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Lithium Zincate&#8208;Mediated I/Zn Exchange Revisited: A Computational Microsolvation Approach in THF
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solv(at)ing the mechanism of lithium zincate&#8208;mediated I/Zn exchange: A computational study through microsolvation approach in tetrahydrofuran is conducted to decipher this mechanism. Three pathways are discussed using new methodologies like IGM, IBSI and NBO. The preferential one proceeds through a two&#8208;step mechanism involving a THF&#8208;solvated open form zincate which firstly acts as a converter of aryl iodide into aryllithium.







Abstract
Lithium trialkylzincate&#8208;mediated I/Zn exchange reaction has been revisited computationally through a microsolvation approach. A never yet investigated iodoaryl derivative bearing a potential bulky para&#8208;directing group, namely 4&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate, was considered as a substrate. THF as typical solvent and Et3ZnLi have also been considered for the first time in such a reaction. Three mechanistic pathways have been calculated, including (1) a literature&#8208;inspired pathway with full preservation of the synergic character of the reagent as well as a complementary mesylate group&#8208;directed pathway, (2) a THF&#8208;solvated open complex&#8208;promoted pathway and (3) an anionic pathway. While the anionic pathway appeared to be unlikely, pathway involving a THF&#8208;solvated open zincate complex turned out to be the most energetically favored. Equivalent thermodynamic profiles were found for both complementary pathways with preservation of the synergic character of the reagent, albeit a slight preference could be attributed to that occurring with initial chelation of Li to the mesylate group (OMs) through microsolvation approach. The I/Zn exchange was shown to proceed through a lithium&#8208;assisted aryl shuttle&#8208;like process. The iodoaryl substrate is first converted into ArLi intermediate which in turns reacts with the remaining diorganozinc reagent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium trialkylzincate-mediated I/Zn exchange reaction has been revisited computationally through a microsolvation approach. A never yet investigated iodoaryl derivative bearing a potential bulky &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-directing group, namely 4-iodobenzyl mesylate, was considered as a substrate. THF as typical solvent and Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZnLi have also been considered for the first time in such a reaction. Three mechanistic pathways have been calculated, including (1) a literature-inspired pathway with full preservation of the synergic character of the reagent as well as a complementary mesylate group-directed pathway, (2) a THF-solvated open complex-promoted pathway and (3) an anionic pathway. While the anionic pathway appeared to be unlikely, pathway involving a THF-solvated open zincate complex turned out to be the most energetically favored. Equivalent thermodynamic profiles were found for both complementary pathways with preservation of the synergic character of the reagent, albeit a slight preference could be attributed to that occurring with initial chelation of Li to the mesylate group (OMs) through microsolvation approach. The I/Zn exchange was shown to proceed through a lithium-assisted aryl shuttle-like process. The iodoaryl substrate is first converted into ArLi intermediate which in turns reacts with the remaining diorganozinc reagent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient Chemoenzymatic Route to Biologically Active Pyridinic Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of optically active pyridinic and dipyridinic ethanamines have been prepared by means of a chemoenzymatic route starting from 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethanones. Two features of the strategy need to be he highlighted: the highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED)&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the starting ketones, and the efficient transformation of the resulting optically active alcohols into the target primary amines.







Abstract
Starting from the easily prepared 1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208; or 1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearer of different substituents (cyclohexyl, phenyl, pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) in the position 2, the corresponding primary pyridinic ethanamines have been synthesized in very high enantiomeric excesses (ee&#8805;97&#8201;%). The strategy involves a highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED) catalyzed reduction, mesylation of the resulting optically active alcohol followed by nucleophilic substitution with azide anion and, finally, reduction of the azide function. Some of these pyridinic amines obtained in such manner are precursors of biologically active compounds such as Ontazolast.

         <title>Synthesis of Donor Substituted Chlorophyll Derivatives for Applications in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of photosynthesis can provide a blueprint for environmentally friendly approaches for sustainable production of green renewable energy and organic matter by artificial photosynthesis. Chlorophylls themselves produced by nature as an almost unlimited resource mark them as attractive pigments for application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).







Abstract
Organic dyes based on chlorophyll derivatives were synthesized and investigated with respect to applications in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis cultivated on large scales in tropical areas around the Pacific Ocean is an attractive source for production and isolation of pure chlorophyll a. Direct transformation of chlorophyll a into very robust chlorin e6 trimethylester 3 affords an ideal platform for synthesis of dyes for artificial photosynthesis. A series of molecules 24&#8211;32 with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structures and functional groups for immobilization on TiO2 were achieved by subsequent synthetic modifications of 3. Photochemical, theoretical and electrochemical properties of dyes were investigated and their sensitized solar cells performances studied after immobilization on TiO2.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Benzofused Five&#8208;Membered N/O/S&#8208;Heterocycles, a Progressive Area in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, and their well&#8208;established synthetic pathways are reviewed.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, possessing a single heteroatom, have important applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material chemistry. Metal&#8208;catalysed reactions are well&#8208;established synthetic pathways for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, enabling the direct synthesis of heterocycles. This approach offers advantages over traditional methods, such as fewer steps, increased atom economy, low catalyst loading, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Due to their widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry, the formation of C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bonds has gained significant attention. This article focusses on the metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis and corresponding mechanistic approaches for N/O/S&#8208;heterocycles, particularly indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, reviewing the progress of the past five years and discussing unexplored future opportunities.

         <title>Enhanced Long&#8208;Term Stability of a Photosensitizer with a Hydroxamic Acid Anchor in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenothiazine sensitizer bearing hydroxamic acid terminal anchoring groups in place of conventional carboxylic acid units showed enhanced long&#8208;term photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the typical aqueous device medium. These findings can play a relevant role for commercial production of green hydrogen.







Abstract
Climate change mitigation on a global scale will only be possible through the achievement of ambitious decarbonisation goals, requiring an energy transition that involves switching from fossil fuels to clean fuels such as hydrogen. The photocatalytic approach is one of the most studied methods for directly converting sunlight into hydrogen. In this work, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of the PTZ1&#8208;HA dye, which was obtained by replacing the terminal conventional carboxylic anchoring moieties of a previously studied phenothiazine&#8208;based dye (PTZ1) with hydroxamic acid functionalities. The photoinduced performance of the two dyes as photosensitizers was compared in both dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells and dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems. PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts showed improved stability in hydrogen generation due to the introduction of the hydroxamic acid as an alternative anchor group, which was shown to slow down hydrolysis in aqueous media. Even though the light harvesting ability of PTZ1&#8208;HA was lower than that of PTZ1, the higher stability of PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized devices allowed for improved photocatalytic generation of H2 over prolonged periods. The superior long&#8208;term efficiency of the hydroxamic acid based dye is important in view of potential practical applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Pantolactone: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone are reviewed and the advantages and disadvantages of common synthetic strategies are highlighted. Among these strategies, direct asymmetric catalysis using small organic molecules as catalysts is an extremely promising approach for the industrial synthesis of D&#8208;pantolactone owing to its high step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, avoidance of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, and convenient operation. This review offers valuable insights and recommendations for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs, providing new and useful guidance in the field.







Abstract
(R)&#8208;Pantolactone, an intermediate in the syntheses of Vitamin B5 and coenzyme A, is an important chiral molecule often used as a food additive, chiral auxiliary, and chiral starting material for organic transformations. Enantioenriched pantolactones are predominantly produced by biological fermentation and chemical synthesis approaches. Herein, we present a review of recent developments in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone through different methods, and systematically summarize the characteristics and advantageous features of these strategies. Among the strategies discussed herein, the direct asymmetric catalysis of glyoxylate and isobutyraldehyde with small organocatalyst molecules has attracted growing attention owing to its good step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, absence of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, convenient operation, and low catalyst loading. These characteristics render the direct asymmetric route to pantolactone a particularly attractive procedure. This review provides valuable guidance for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs.

         <dc:description>
A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans, which produced to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones under heating conditions.







Abstract
A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans from 1,4&#8208;enediones at room temperature. This transformation involves aza&#8208;Michael addition, intramolecular bicyclization, and rearrangement processes. In addition, the 4&#8208;ureidofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate ester products can further be converted to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones through intramolecular substitution cyclization under heating conditions.

         <title>The Mechanism of Lithium Zincate&#8208;Mediated I/Zn Exchange Revisited: A Computational Microsolvation Approach in THF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the most favorable calculated transition state (TS) through which the I/Zn exchange reaction of 4&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate with Et3ZnLi proceeds in THF. This TS was located through micro&#8208;solvation approach by contacting a doubly&#8208;THF solvated open zincate complex, identified as one of the 3 limit forms of the reagent, and the iodoaryl derivative. From this TS, the I/Zn exchange product is obtained via a 2 step&#8208;mechanism. First, the ArI substrate is converted into ArLi intermediate which then reacts with the remaining Et2Zn entity.More information can be found in the Research Article by Cl&#233;ment Denhez, Alexandre Vasseur, and co&#8208;workers

         <title>Synthesis of Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Isoquinol&#8208;Based BODIPY Dyes and Their Properties as Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six new isoquinol&#8208;based BODIPY dyes have been synthesized by a two&#8208;step method. Unlike traditional synthetic methods, synthesis did not require the use of oxidizing agents or solvent. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and DFT calculations indicate that the properties associated with the six dyes are very similar with little influence of the meso&#8208;substituents. Viscosity studies identified three of the new dyes having properties of molecular rotors for applications in the detection of changes in cellular viscosity. Incubation of the dyes with the HEK cell line show no toxicity up to 10 &#956;M over a 72 h. period. The dyes show the ability to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. With two of the dyes showing favorable comparisons to commercially available ER dyes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed annulation of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and internal alkynes for the synthesis of quinoxalines is developed. This method provides a variety of quinoxalines in good to high yields under a simple and mild reaction conditions with molecular O2 as a terminal oxidant.

         <title>Ligand Combination Approach in Pd Catalyzed Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Benzothiazole and Benzoxazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the use of ligand combination approach in the Pd catalyzed direct C&#8208;H arylation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole. The combination of two ligands phenanthroline monohydrate (Phen.H2O) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) with Pd&#8208;catalyst have offered the best catalytic properties in the C&#8208;H bond arylation reactions than either of two ligands employed separately in the reactions. This protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope affording C2 arylated benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives in excellent yields. Mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), H/D exchange and competition experiments show that the C&#8208;H bond activation of benzothiazole/benzoxazole is very facile under reaction conditions. Furthermore, different mechanistic pathways originated from the catalytically active species such as Pd(&#951;2&#8208;dba)L (dba = dibenzylidene acetone) and Pd(PPh3)2 were investigated using computational methods. The computational results suggest that the generation of catalytically active species from Pd2(dba)3 is endoergic process and Phen ligand can initiate this step. On the other hand, the presence of PPh3 could be crucial for the oxidative addition of aryl halides which is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine compounds are described with perfluoroalkyl chains and S&#8208;perfluoromethyl sulfoximines as ligands of the halogen. The influence of these groups on the stability of the cyclic structure is studied. The crucial role of the trifluoromethyl chain is clearly highlighted as efficient ligand for the hypervalency. The structure and the reactivity of the new skeletons are discussed into details.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A first access to mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;(Het)arylated pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazoles is reported. The series were generated from a library of 3&#8208;(Het)arylpyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazole platforms selectively functionalized through regioselective arylation procedures. The regioselective functionalization in C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;7 positions was investigated. Each Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling condition was optimized and a representative library of the scope and limitations of the reactions was studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8208;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY NMR, Mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Substituted Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward approach to &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted saturated bicyclic amines starting from commercially available compounds is proposed. The key steps include addition of the Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent to imine moiety and AlMe3&#8208;promoted intramolecular hetero&#173;cyclization. The reaction sequence provides an access to fluorine&#8208;containing azabicyclo[n.2.1]alkane (n = 1&#8211;3) or azabicyclo[2.2.2]&#173;octane derivatives in 10&#8211;42% overall yield. The physicochemical properties of the prepared compounds or their model derivatives (i.e., pKa and LogP) were measured and compared to those for the parent monocyclic or non&#8208;fluorinated saturated heterocycles. As expected, amine basicity was lowered considerably upon introduction of the CF3 group (&#916;pKa &#8776; 4), while the lipophilicity increased (by ca. 0.5 LogP units). The summarized data provides a convenient guideline for application of the synthesized compounds in drug discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is a reliable method to prepare important chiral molecules in highly optically enriched forms. Although methods for the catalytic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols, amines, and epoxides have been extensively investigated, the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids has remained under&#8208;developed despite the importance of chiral carboxylic acids. Excellent catalytic approaches for the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids via esterification using chiral organocatalysts have been reported by several research groups. Furthermore, the organocatalyzed lactonization of alkenyl and alkynyl carboxylic acids has also been adapted to achieve kinetic resolution. Herein, the methods typically used to produce the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Energy Transfer for Atom Economical Synthesis of O&#8208;Bridged Tricyclo&#8208;Fused Cyclopropane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light mediated, photocatalyzed energy transfer for the atom economical synthesis of a diverse range of oxygen&#8208;bridged tricyclo&#8208;fused cyclopropane derivatives in moderate to high yields is disclosed.







Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed a feasible approach to access oxygen bridged tricycle&#8208;fused cyclopropane derivatives via visible light mediated photocatalyzed energy transfer process.

         <dc:description>We report synthesis of cross&#8208;linked pseudopeptides via palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction involves the coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid iodides with &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters via in situ CO insertion to give pseudopeptides linked by way of the side chain of the electrophilic counterpart. The key features are the use of sustainable in situ CO surrogate, simple non&#8208;inert conditions, short time, and substrate scope. Both amino acids and peptide iodides were utilized as coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Hydrohalogenation and Deuteriohalogenation by Ex Situ Generation of HX and DX Gas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins by ex situ generation of near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas using a two&#8208;chamber reactor. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.







Abstract
The hydrohalogenation of olefins is one of the most straightforward methods to access alkyl halides. Despite safety hazards, using pure hydrogen halide gas remains the most atom economic way of performing hydrohalogenation reactions. In this work, we describe the solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins using down to near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas. Two&#8208;chamber reactors are employed as an enabling platform to access these reactive gases in a laboratory setting. Ex situ generation from inexpensive and readily available precursors provides on&#8208;demand access to these gases (hydrogen chloride, deuterium chloride, hydrogen bromide, deuterium bromide, hydrogen iodide, and deuterium iodide) with precise stoichiometric control. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.

         <title>Reassignment of the Structure of Janthinolide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported structure of janthinolide A has been shown to be incorrect. Comparison of spectroscopic data combined with CASE and DFT methods were used to demonstrate that it is probably identical to janthinolide C.







Abstract
Using computational methods and chemical intuition, the proposed structure of janthinolide A is shown to be incorrect. It is further shown that the material described as janthinolide A is highly likely to be janthinolide C.

A novel approach to perform C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization at the C6 position of 7&#8208;azaindazoles is reported. This method employs regioselective oxidative arylation, facilitated by N&#8208;oxide activation. By utilizing this technique, precise and innovative synthesis of C6&#8208;arylated 7&#8208;azaindazoles using various substituted arenes and heteroarenes is achieved.

         <title>Radical Thiocyano(Selenocyano)trifluoromethylations of Alkenes on Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes provides a step&#8208;economical route to CF3&#8208;containing polyfunctionalized organics. New and scalable processes are highly desired in this field. Here, we report a simple and environmentally benign method for olefinic thiocyanotrifluoromethylation. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. All tested reactions are compatible with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes and with high functional group tolerance. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. Therefore, a sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way.

         <title>Ring Expansion Reactions through Intramolecular Transamidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes examples of ring expansion reactions through intramolecular transamidation. This synthetic approach allows the preparation of a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.







Abstract
Synthetic methodologies based on cycle expansion reactions have proven to be highly effective in delivering valuable medium&#8208;sized cycles and macrocycles. A primary method of ring expansion relies on intramolecular transamidation reactions. These reactions typically employ N&#8208;aminoalkyl and N&#8208;aminoacyl derivatives of lactams and their analogues as starting materials, yielding a diverse spectrum of unique nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.
This Review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research outcomes related to intramolecular transamidation reactions that lead to cycle expansion. This will offer the reader a perspective on the potential applications of such reactions in generating novel and intriguing types of heterocyclic systems.

         <title>Two anti&#8208;Prelog NAD&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenases with broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure alcohols are important to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals and fine chemicals. Herein, we explored the substrate scope and chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity of two NAD&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases from Candida maris (Cm&#8208;ADH) and Pichia finlandica (Pf&#8208;ADH) in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The ADHs were tested for the reduction of acetophenone with NADH that was recycled using a formate dehydrogenase and sodium formate. Cm&#8208;ADH and Pf&#8208;ADH performed best at 30 &#176;C and&#160;around pH 7 and pH 6, respectively. Pf&#8208;ADH operated well at 50 mM acetophenone concentration, while Cm&#8208;ADH was limited to 10 mM. Regarding the substrate scope, linear&#8208;chain alkyl ketones were efficiently reduced (up to 98% conversion), while branched and cyclic ketones gave lower conversions (up to 60%). Aryl&#8208;aliphatic ketones showed variable levels of conversion (&lt;1&#8211;79%), while &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated and heteroaromatic ketones exhibited good to excellent conversions. In most of the cases, the enantiomeric excess was &gt;99%. Aliphatic and aryl&#8208;aliphatic aldehydes were converted with up to &gt;99% conversion. A scale&#8208;up experiment with Pf&#8208;ADH using acetophenone as substrate led to 73% isolated yield and &gt;99% ee (R). This work contributes to filling the gap in biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohols by introducing two NAD&#8208;dependent ADHs with anti&#8208;Prelog selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free formylation of imidazopyridines by direct decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of glyoxylic acid in presence of K2S2O8 as oxidant under mild and neutral conditions is described. This reaction features a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and generates products in good yields between 68&#8211;85&#8201;%. The translational capacity of the reaction from a laboratory methodology to gram&#8208;scale synthesis has also been ensured. The involvement of a radical pathway has been demonstrated by radical trapping experiments with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (BHT).

         <title>Development of the Meyer Schuster Rearrangement on Propargylic Alcohols with Fluorinated Chains.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Meyer&#8208;Schuster Rearrangement (MSR) is a challenging process for propargylic alcohols bearing fluorine atom(s) on their chains. Most classical reagents/catalysts failed to perform MSR but, after extensive screening, we demonstrated that phosphomolybdic acid was the first efficient catalyst for MSR with such derivatives. The scope and limitations have been studied, affording fluorine&#8208;containing enones as useful intermediates for the synthesis of targets with fluorine(s) on their side chains. It was exemplified by the preparation of a 2&#8208;piperidino&#8208;pyrimidine and a pyrazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Metallaphotoredox Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reactions: A Perspective on Irradiation Light Wavelength</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of C&#8208;N bonds is considered as the most useful reaction in the synthetic chemistry due to their widespread presence in pharmaceuticals, natural products, etc.. Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA) has provided the most efficient method to form (hetero)aryl amines but requiring strong base and sophisticated ligands. In comparison, the combination of photocatalysis and nickel chemistry has revolutionized catalytic strategies and is emerging as a quintessence to realize BHAs, termed as Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA. To pursue a universal protocol, diverse photocatalysts are designed and employed in Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA, and smoothly promote C&#8208;N bond formations under irradiation of light from ultraviolet to red light respectively. Note that the matching of photocatalyst and light is critical to the success. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the discussion of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHAs according to irradiation light&#8217;s wavelength, covering ultraviolet, purple, blue, red and white light as well as solar light. We try to find a clue in structure&#8208;photophysical behaviors of photocatalysts under the same or different irradiation light. At last, current limitations and potential trends for advancing Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHAs are highlighted. We deem that it could encourage chemists to continue designing suitable photocatalyst for C&#8208;N bond formations under sunlight mimicking plants'&#160;photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy for Improving the Efficiency of Boronic Acid Catalysis in the Synthesis of Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel boronic acids have been developed for the catalyzed amide synthesis. Lewis acidity estimation using DFT, associated with collected kinetic data, allowed to uncover ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art boronic acids. Efficient coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids as well as primary and secondary amines were obtained.







Abstract
This study outlines the development of novel boronic acids as catalysts for the direct synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines. The Lewis acidity of the boronic acids was estimated by means of computational techniques, and the observed increase in catalytic activity was corroborated by kinetic data derived from a model reaction. Our investigations led to the discovery of a set of ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. These newly developed catalysts demonstrated efficacy in the coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic acids, as well as primary and secondary amines.

         <title>Hydroxynitrile Lyase Discovery, Engineering and Promiscuity Towards Asymmetric Synthesis: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) primarily catalyze the stereoselective synthesis of cyanohydrins, but some of them also carry out asymmetric nitroaldol synthesis (Henry reaction). By virtue of the importance of asymmetric C&#8208;C bond formation, and the wide application of chiral cyanohydrins and &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, HNLs have gained significance in organic synthesis. Over the years new HNLs have been discovered and their synthetic scope are evaluated. Engineering of HNLs has contributed towards increasing not only the catalytic toolbox but also broad substrate selectivity, stereoselectivity, enzyme stability and application of the enzymes for different transformations other than the conventional ones. This review describes the recent discoveries of diverse hydroxynitrile lyases, and the developments to date since 2016, with respect to their biocatalytic applications in the asymmetric synthesis using both natural and promiscuous reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fused Tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;Iminosugar Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the catalysis of Yb(OTf)3, the cyclization of iminium&#8208;ion intermediates and imines was promoted through the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism, providing a simple reaction for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;iminosugars derivatives with good stereoselectivity. The absolute structures of compounds 1&#8201;a and 5&#8201;a were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and 2D NMR.







Abstract
An efficient and simple one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally diverse novel tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused iminosugars was developed through the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism. The adaptability of this method has been demonstrated by a variety of imines and d/l&#8208;ribose tosylates, and both, electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituted imines proceed well. In addition, this reaction is characterized by simple operation, good yield, and high atom economy. Some synthetic iminosugars showed moderate anti proliferation of HCT116 tumor cells.

Design and synthesis of various benzofuro&#8208;fused 7&#8208;deazapurine (6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribo&#8208; and ribonucleosides is reported. The synthesis route comprises Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of iodobenzofurane with zincated 4,6&#8208;dichloropyrimidine followed by azidation and photochemical cyclization. Glycosylation of the heterocycle with either Hoffer's chlorodeoxyribose or protected ribose followed by cross&#8208;coupling or substitution reactions at position 10 gave the desired two sets of final nucleosides that showed moderate to weak cytostatic activity and interesting fluorescence properties.







Abstract
A series of benzofuro&#8208;fused 7&#8208;deazapurine (6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribo&#8208; and ribonucleosides was designed and synthesized. The synthesis of key compound 10&#8208;chloro&#8208;6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole was based on the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of iodobenzofurane with zincated 4,6&#8208;dichloropyrimidine followed by azidation and photochemical cyclization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of benzofuro-fused 7-deazapurine (6&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-furo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimido[4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole) 2&#8217;-deoxyribo- and ribonucleosides was designed and synthesized. The synthesis of key compound 10-chloro-6&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-furo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimido[4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole was based on the Negishi cross-coupling of iodobenzofurane with zincated 4,6-dichloropyrimidine followed by azidation and photochemical cyclization. Glycosylation of the heterocycle with either Hoffer's chlorodeoxyribose or protected ribose followed by cross-coupling or substitution reactions at position 10&#8197;gave the desired two sets of final nucleosides that showed moderate to weak cytostatic activity and interesting fluorescence properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ex&#8208;Situ Generation of Bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide and Applications to Trifluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an operationally simple protocol for the ex&#8208;situ generation of the toxic and volatile disulfide, CF3SSCF3, from the readily available and cost&#8208;efficient Langlois reagent is reported. Among the trifluoromethythiolations reaction studied, application of this disulfide in a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl boronic acids is disclosed, showing good to excellent yields of trifluoromethylthio&#8208;substituted aryl products.







Abstract
Herein, a convenient and operationally simple protocol for the ex&#8208;situ generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide from the readily available and commercial Langlois reagent is reported. The one&#8208;step synthesis of the toxic and volatile CF3SSCF3 is performed in a two&#8208;chamber reactor with simple PPh3 and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as the activator, allowing for the safe handling and tandem utilization in direct trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. The versatility of the ex&#8208;situ generated CF3SSCF3 is demonstrated in known electrophilic, nucleophilic, and a radical trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Furthermore, the application of the CF3SSCF3 in a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with boronic acids is disclosed, showing good to excellent yields of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aryl products, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

         <title>DFT Studies on Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Secondary Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT computations were carried out on Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of SPOs, and a modified mechanism including tautomerization and arylation was presented. Various tautomerization mechanisms have been investigated, and the results highlight the catalytic effect of base on this process. Further computations indicate that oxidative addition is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, and the origin of selectivity was thought to be the difference in non&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
Asymmetric arylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) has been rapidly developed, while there are few theoretical studies reported. DFT computations were carried out to study the whole catalytic cycle of Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of SPOs, and a modified mechanism including tautomerization and arylation was presented. Some new tautomerization mechanisms have been traversed, including base&#8208;assisted and Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed tautomerization. These are different from the existing report, where base&#8208;assisted tautomerization is the most favored. The resulting intermediate enters the downstream arylation directly. Furthermore, oxidative addition is identified as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. IGMH analysis results indicate that the different non&#8208;bonding interactions between Xiao&#8208;Phos and SPO parts determine the enantioselectivity. This work not only provides deeper insights into the self&#8208;adaptive property of SadPhos ligands but also offers valuable guidance for ligand design. Newly proposed tautomerization mechanisms will also bring some inspiration to subsequent related research.

         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids is disclosed. The catalytic system is composed of naturally occurring Mohr salt and readily available di(2&#8208;picolyl)amine. A range of ketones, aldehydes and amides were efficiently obtained including marketed drug derivatives. A mechanistic rational is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and UV&#8211;Vis monitoring.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible light&#8208;driven, dioxygen mediated decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids is disclosed. The catalytic system based on naturally existing Mohr salt and simple di(2&#8208;picolyl)amine ligand is readily available and inexpensive. The applicability of the method was demonstrated through the efficient and selective synthesis of a range of ketones, aldehydes and amides including drug derivatives. Based on experimental investigations, a hypothetical mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Green Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Unsubstituted Isoquinolones through Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation and Annulation in Ethanol</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient method for synthesizing 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolines has been developed via rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and annulation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mild and convenient synthesis of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones has been achieved from N&#8208;methoxybenzamides and vinylene carbonate as an acetylene surrogate with a versatile rhodium(III) catalyst. The reaction proceeded at room temperature in biomass derived ethanol solvent. This protocol avoids the use of stoichiometric external oxidant, as the vinylene carbonate served as the internal oxidant. The C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activation and annulation manifold proceeded with broad substrate scope and excellent levels of regioselectivities. The preliminary mechanistic studies suggest facile and reversible chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H rhodation. Diversification of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones provide access to 4&#8208;substituted isoquinolones and 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolines, which are complementary to the previously reported protocols.

         <title>UVA&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Aerobic Oxidation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the irradiation source wavelength provides the advantage in developing a catalyst&#8208;free photooxidative protocol based on boronic acid&#8208; DIPEA complex's ability to generate reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The hydroxy group, and the phenol moiety in particular, is ubiquitous in several natural products, in organic synthesis and/or pharmaceutical industry. With the uprise of photoredox catalysis, many efforts worldwide focus on developing novel and sustainable protocols, providing an easy access to hydroxy&#8208;containing molecules. Boronic acids and boronic ester derivatives are considered valuable precursors for the synthesis of hydroxy group derivatives. Herein, we report a novel, sustainable, light&#8208;driven protocol, where the impact of wavelength irradiation on boronic acid aerobic photooxidation was examined. In this work, UVA&#8208;light (370&#8197;nm) irradiation was found to promote the photocatalyst&#8208;free aerobic oxidation of boronic acids and boronic acid derivatives. Furthermore, a broad scope of substrates was tested, and extensive mechanistic studies were performed in order to probe the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Aldol/Brook/Carbon Skeletal Rearrangement Cascade Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Silyl Ketones with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenylation of aldehydes with &#946;&#8208;silyl ketones proceeded to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with skeletal rearrangement. The reaction mechanism involved tandem aldol/[1,4]&#8208;Brook/1,2&#8208;addition/ring cleavage of cyclopropane. [1,4] Brook rearrangement took place with complete inversion of configuration at the carbon center.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Silyl ketones reacted with aldehydes by treatment with KMMDS in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 to give &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones accompanied with a skeletal rearrangement. The reactions proceeded by aldol reaction of &#946;&#8208;silyl ketones with aldehydes followed by [1,4]&#8208;Brook rearrangement and intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition to form cyclopropanol derivatives, in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage took place to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones were prepared in a one&#8208;pot manner by conjugate addition of silyl anions to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones followed by reactions with aldehydes. The Brook rearrangement proceeded with complete inversion of configuration at the carbon center.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Regioselective C3&#8722;H Benzoxylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles with Benzoyl Peroxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;O bond formation reaction for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl benzoates was developed. The C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in acetonitrile at room temperature under open flask conditions is step and reagent economic. Notably, indole&#8208;3&#8208;ylester derivatives represent important structures in various biologically active compounds, such as antivirals, phosphoryl transferase inhibitors, CDK inhibitors, and diagnostic reagents for wounds.







Abstract
An efficient catalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;O bond formation reaction for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl benzoates was developed through C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in acetonitrile at room temperature under open flask conditions. The reaction proceeds without exclusion of air or moisture and is applied to a wide array of electronically differentiated indoles as well as BPOs. C3 benzoxylation of indoles was achieved with excellent regioselectivity under mild and easy to operate conditions. The reaction is scalable to one gram level.

Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated isocoumarins can be obtained with excellent yield at room temperature. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst and exhibits high functional group tolerance. Besides, the reaction can also be extended to the gram scale, and a catalytic approach was also demonstrated. Additionally, the prepared 3&#8208;bromoisocoumarins were further transformed into important synthetic compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The alkyne group is the key component of many bioactive molecules and versatile synthetic building block, thus the introduction of which into target molecules has attracted considerable interest from scientists. Moreover, tertiary and quaternary stereocenters are common motifs in natural products and drugs, however, the asymmetric construction of such motifs is one of the challenging tasks owe to the steric congestion of multiple stereospecific substituents attached to one carbon. Metal&#8211;allenylidene are an excellent type of electrophilic species. The asymmetric addition of carbon&#8208;nucleophiles at C&#947; of the metal&#8211;allenylidene provides an effective way to construct tertiary and quaternary stereocenters as well as to introduce an alkyne group. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric propargylic C&#8211;C bond formation via metal&#8208;allenylidene generated in situ from propargylic alcohol derivatives are presented.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions for the synthesis of organic molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of enzymes for the synthesis of valuable bioactive molecules, synthetic building blocks, fine chemicals and natural products is now well&#8208;established. Biocatalysis has been embraced by industry for the preparation of both bulk chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, where high activity and selectivity can be achieved with low environmental impact. In most cases, biocatalytic transformations involve&#160;functional group interconversions, such as redox and amination reactions, but do not lead to significant complexity generation in the molecule. This review explores the less prevalent&#160;enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions, where the enzymatic transformation triggers a subsequent spontaneous reaction inter/intramolecularly. The examples highlighted in this review showcase the synthetic power of designing smart substrates for enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions and their application for the preparation of structurally complex three&#8208;dimensional small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Impact of Added Al(OTf)3 on DalPhos/Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylations of Amides with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose herein our study examining the potential activating effect of added aluminum triflate (5 mol%) on the (DalPhos)Ni(aryl)Cl (1 mol% Ni) catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of primary amides with (hetero)aryl chlorides. In some instances, dramatically improved conversion to product was achieved by use of added aluminum triflate; with furfurylamine catalytic inhibition occurred. The reaction outcome appears to result from the interplay of DalPhos ligand and aryl group within the Ni pre&#8208;catalyst, as well as the identity of the cross&#8208;coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Z&#8208;Enantioselective Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview covering all the breakthroughs accomplished in the field of challenging Z&#8208;enantioselective olefin metathesis, which is of interest in the total synthesis of complex molecules.







Abstract
Asymmetric Olefin Metathesis (AOM) represents a highly versatile synthetic tool to lead to relevant chiral building blocks with excellent enantiopurity. As the Z&#8208;alkene moiety is ubiquitous in a wide range of natural products, the development of catalysts which are able to control both the Z&#8208;selectivity and the enantioselectivity of metathesis transformations is in high demands. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview covering all the breakthroughs accomplished in the field of challenging Z&#8208;enantioselective olefin metathesis, which is of interest in the total synthesis of complex molecules.

         <title>Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation Covalent Exchanges on 1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzylic and aliphatic 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium iodides were synthesized to study the influence of the nature and the position of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents on trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions. The kinetic study conducted proved that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions between the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts and an excess of methyl iodide are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones and moderately faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position.







Abstract
1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts having either aliphatic or benzylic substituents at the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 positions were synthesized in two steps involving: i) copper(I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), and ii) N&#8208;alkylation of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole intermediates. Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions in bulk and in the presence of excess methyl iodide were monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy for each 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium molecular model. By assigning the different formed species and their respective evolution with time, it was possible to conclude that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the exchange reactions are noticeably faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position most likely due to the steric hindrance induced by the neighboring C&#8208;4 substituent. The kinetics of trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions are thus influenced by both the chemical nature of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents and the regiochemistry of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium group. This provides important structural design rules to improve the properties of thermosetting covalent adaptable networks involving trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Microwave&#8208;Assisted Sonogashira Reactions of Triflate&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new triflatophenylporphyrin building block for Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions is proposed. Compared to halophenylporphyrins, its purification it is much easier. The triflatophenylporphyrin is also suitable in microwave&#8208;assisted Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling and, to further showcase its utility, has been used to prepare a donor&#8208;acceptor array.







Abstract
Porphyrins that bear halogens at the meso&#8208;aryl positions are useful building blocks for the preparation of light&#8208;harvesting arrays and materials through cross&#8208;coupling procedures. Despite the wide use of such intermediates, their scale&#8208;up and purification are usually hampered by tedious chromatographic separations because of the statistical nature of the synthetic protocol and the similar polarity of the different products. Here, we propose the use of porphyrins bearing a triflatophenyl group as alternative starting materials for palladium cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In particular, purification of the zinc 5,10,15&#8208;triaryl&#8208;20&#8208;(4&#8208;triflatophenyl)porphyrin (ZnP&#8208;OTf) model compound by column chromatography proved to be much easier compared to porphyrin analogues that carry halogen substituents. This is the result of the increased polarity of compounds functionalized by highly polar triflate groups if compared to those substituted by halogens. To show the value of the triflatophenylporphyrin model compound in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we developed a microwave&#8208;assisted Sonogashira protocol that quantitatively converts the ZnP&#8208;OTf to the corresponding alkynylphenylporphyrin, in relatively short reaction times. Finally, we showed that the proposed ZnP&#8208;OTf building block can be conveniently converted into an alkynyl&#8208;linked molecular wire to bridge the zinc porphyrin donor with the [60]fullerene acceptor in a molecular dyad. The prepared dyad showed efficient photoinduced charge separation from singlet ZnP excited state to [60]fullerene in a polar solvent.

&lt;p&gt;Porphyrins that bear halogens at the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-aryl positions are useful building blocks for the preparation of light-harvesting arrays and materials through cross-coupling procedures. Despite the wide use of such intermediates, their scale-up and purification are usually hampered by tedious chromatographic separations because of the statistical nature of the synthetic protocol and the similar polarity of the different products. Here, we propose the use of porphyrins bearing a triflatophenyl group as alternative starting materials for palladium cross-coupling reactions. In particular, purification of the zinc 5,10,15-triaryl-20-(4-triflatophenyl)porphyrin (&lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt;) model compound by column chromatography proved to be much easier compared to porphyrin analogues that carry halogen substituents. This is the result of the increased polarity of compounds functionalized by highly polar triflate groups if compared to those substituted by halogens. To show the value of the triflatophenylporphyrin model compound in cross-coupling reactions, we developed a microwave-assisted Sonogashira protocol that quantitatively converts the &lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt; to the corresponding alkynylphenylporphyrin, in relatively short reaction times. Finally, we showed that the proposed &lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt; building block can be conveniently converted into an alkynyl-linked molecular wire to bridge the zinc porphyrin donor with the [60]fullerene acceptor in a molecular dyad. The prepared dyad showed efficient photoinduced charge separation from singlet ZnP excited state to [60]fullerene in a polar solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epimerization of trans&#8208;Cycloalkenes with the X&#8722;C=C&#8722;SeR*&#8208;Unit &#8211; The Steric Demand of X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3</title>

         <dc:description>
The ring inversion of trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, ring sizes 9&#8211;20, investigated with temperature variable 13C NMR spectroscopy, is a highly sensitive method to characterize the steric demand of substituents: H&#8810;F&#8810;Cl&lt;Me &lt;Br&lt;I&lt;Et&lt;CF&#8323;.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;cycloalkenes with the X&#8722;C=C&#8722;SeR*&#8208;unit and ring sizes from 9 to 20 have been synthesized. R* bonding the selenium atom is the chiral (S)&#8208;o&#8208;(1&#8208;Methoxypropyl)phenyl&#8208;moiety, and X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3. The planar&#8208;chiral trans&#8208;cycloalkenes in combination with the chiral residue R* exist as two diastereomers. These can be distinguished in principle by NMR spectroscopy. Here, we have studied the epimerization of the trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, i.&#8201;e., the 180&#176; rotation of the X&#8722;C=C&#8208;unit through the cavity of the ring. The measurements were done with variable temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy within the range from &#8722;110 to 140&#8201;&#176;C. The obtained values of the Gibbs energy of activation &#916;G&#8800;C depend strongly on the ring size. Furthermore, the &#916;G&#8800;C values show dramatic steric effects due to the groups X. The steric requirement of X increases in the series H&#8810;F&#8810;Cl&lt;Me&lt;Br&lt;I&lt;Et&lt;CF3. Here, F is significantly larger than H, and CF3 is larger than Et. The corresponding iPr&#8208;compounds could not be synthesized. The transition state structures of the ring inversion for ring sizes 8&#8211;20 were calculated at the DFT level of theory.

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing reaction and work&#8208;up efficiency was studied using a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains IRED, ADH and NADPH within a superabsorber, in pure organic medium. The reduction of a 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline gave 98&#8201;% conversion, 88&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee at a simplified work&#8208;up based on decantation.







Abstract
A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase (IRED), NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98&#8201;% conversion, 88&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee at a substrate concentration of 40&#8197;mM.

         <title>Radical Acylation of Alkenes via NHC&#8208;Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed radical&#8208;radical reactions have been proven to be powerful strategies for assembling ketyl&#8208;containing compounds via single electron transfer (SET) pathway under either thermal conditions or photoredox conditions. In this context, acylation of alkenes via radical relay under NHC&#8208;organocatalysis has also opened a new window for the difunctionalization of alkenes to construct valuable molecules in organic synthesis. In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems. Conclusions and perspectives were also put forward at the end.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient method to synthesize thioethers from readily available sulfonyl chlorides and benzylic trimethylammonium salts via C&#8722;N cleavage of benzyl ammonium salts has been developed. This methodology features mild reaction conditions and good substrate compatibility.







Abstract
A facile and efficient method to synthesize thioethers from sulfonyl chlorides and benzylic trimethylammonium salts is presented. This protocol provides a simple and direct approach to realize the reductive coupling reaction of readily available sulfonyl chlorides with benzyl ammonium salts in the presence of triphenylphosphine along with base via C&#8722;N cleavage of benzyl ammonium salts. This reaction features mild conditions and good substrate compatibility to afford thioethers in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Photoinduced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Cyclic Enones and 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazoles: An Unprecedented Pathway to Polysubstituted Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the syntheses of original pyrazolines and pyrazoles through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic enones with 2,5&#8208;disubstituted nitrile imines achieved via photochemical activation of 2,5&#8208;diaryl substituted tetrazoles. Monitoring of the reactions, similar to nitrile imine&#8208;mediated tetrazole&#8208;ene cycloadditions (NITEC), could be performed by means of UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission measurements. The presence or absence of substituents in the alpha position of the ketone function makes it possible to direct these reactions towards the selective formation of pyrazoles or pyrazolines. The choice of the cyclic enones and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazoles proved crucial for the fluorescence properties of the polycyclic derivatives obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Sulfonium Salts as Aryl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advancements in synthetic applications involving aryl radicals, utilizing aryl sulfonium salts as precursors. This topic, while challenging, holds paramount significance for drug design and the agrochemical industry. The mechanisms underlying these transformations are also discussed.







Abstract
The utilization of aryl radicals as open&#8208;shelled intermediates has become an essential tool for both conventional and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic chemistry. However, the current methods for generating aryl radicals are still inefficient, greatly impeding their practical applications. Encouragingly, sulfonium salts have emerged as appealing sources of aryl radicals for a wide range of transformations aimed at creating novel chemical bonds driven by their distinctive structural attributes and chemical tendencies. This review primarily focuses on the specific reaction mechanisms underlying the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in sulfonium salts, leading to the generation of corresponding aryl radicals within diverse reaction conditions.

         <title>Organometallic Reagents: Efficient Tools for the Synthesis of Fused Pyridinyl&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a one pot synthesis of fused substituted heteroaryl&#8208;lactones involving a Metal/Halogen Exchange reaction as key step, the reactivity of various mono&#8208; or bimetallic reagents (organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes) was explored to aim high chemoselectivity and efficiency starting from sensitive substrates.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot route to a wide range of 3&#8208;substituted fused pyridinyl&#8208;lactones, so called aza&#8208;phthalides. The developed strategy involves a Metal/Halogen Exchange (MHE) reaction as key step, followed by an electrophile trapping using various carbonyl derivatives and a subsequent lactonization. To promote the MHE reaction with high chemoselectivity, our investigations have particularly focused on the nature of mono&#8208; or bimetallic derivatives as metalation reagents including organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes, and highlighted the positive salt effect on reactional sequence. An extension to fused heteroaryl&#8208;lactones (benzothienyl&#8208;, benzofuranyl&#8208; and naphthofuranyl scaffolds) was explored.

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement derived from &#945;&#8208;thioesters/&#945;&#8208;selenoesters and sulfoxonium ylides has been developed for the synthesis of various sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing ortho&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in medium to excellent yields (39 examples; up to 97&#8201;%). Sulfoxonium ylides as the safe carbene precursors are firstly used in Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement reactions, which is superior to traditional diazo compounds. The present reaction has the advantages of mild condition, safety and broad substrate scope, which afford a unique method for the synthesis of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds with a tertiary carbon center.

         <title>A Biomimetic Stereoselective Approach to Euolutchuol C and Its Structural Assignment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stereoselective total synthesis of euolutchuol C is demonstrated using a biomimetic cationic polyene cyclization, and its absolute structure is established. Four potential stereoisomers of euolutchuol C were synthesized to confirm the structure as an aromatic abietane diterpenoid consisting of a 15(S)&#8208;stereogenic center. Asymmetric Sharpless dihydroxylation was employed to build the chiral epoxide, while CBS&#8208;reduction was utilized to obtain enantiomerically pure benzylic alcohols. A convergent approach is used to synthesize euolutchuol C in seven longest linear steps resulting in an overall yield of 23&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Benzyl Alcohols to N&#8208;Protected Anilines and Alkyl Alcohols to Carbamoyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot, scalable procedures converting benzylic or aliphatic alcohols to various N&#8208;functionalized amines are reported in 38&#8208;83% overall yields. These multi&#8208;step conversions are relatively economic and involve the oxidative formation of acid chloride intermediates and the Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides. Notable aspects of economy include: (1) the use of a relatively green solvent (chlorobenzene) that tolerates both ionic and radical reactions, without the need for rigorously dry or O2&#8208;free conditions; (2) the use of minimal amounts of trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and green chlorinating agent to oxidize the alcohol starting materials and then transform the aldehyde intermediates to acid chlorides under photoirradiation for azide addition; (3) the efficient capture of isocyanate intermediates by alcohol or azide nucleophiles providing N&#8208;protected anilines or N&#8208;protected alkylamines, respectively, the latter of which was employed in the synthesis of an anti&#8208;dementia drug, memantine hydrochloride, over two purification steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Electron&#8208;Rich Dibenzofurans through NBu4OAc&#8208;Mediated Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;donating substituents. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base and ligand, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to dibenzofurans.







Abstract
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;rich aryl rings. Forming the key intramolecular Ar&#8722;Ar bond using traditional cross&#8208;coupling is difficult. The C&#8722;H functionalisation (C&#8722;H activation) approach is, in principle, far more useful. However, we previously found that the well&#8208;established conditions, which promote C&#8722;H functionalisation through Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation (CMD), proved unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base, ligand and solvent, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to electron&#8208;rich dibenzofurans.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful method to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available materials. In this review, the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes covering mainly contributions over the past decade are summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities in this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most powerful and straightforward methods to forge a new C&#8722;H bond and a new C&#8722;X (X=C, N, O, F, Si etc) bond, which provides an efficient way to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available feedstocks. Catalytic asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of simple alkenes is challenging but still highly sought after. This review will mainly focus on the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes over the past decade, including hydroamination, hydrooxygenation, hydrofluorination, hydrosilylation, hydroarylation, hydroalkenylation and hydrocarbonylation.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Ortho Effect on the Excited State Pathways of Chloroanilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry allows to elucidate the observed selectivity in the photochemistry of chloroanilines. A meta&#8208;ortho effect of the substituents favours the population of the prefulvenic conical intersection which leads to rapid deactivation of the m&#8208; and o&#8208;isomers of chloroaniline, while the para derivative lives long enough to emit and populate the reactive triplet state which leads to C&#8722;Cl dissociation.







Abstract
Direct excitation of aromatic compounds grants access to high&#8208;energy intermediates that can be utilised in organic synthesis. Understanding and predicting the substituent effects at the excited state for aromatic molecules remains challenging for the synthetic photochemist. In this work, we present an experimental and computational investigation of the excited state of the isomeric chloroanilines, which promptly react by losing the chloride when the amino group is in para position, but are non&#8208;reactive and non&#8208;emissive in the meta and ortho isomers. XMS&#8208;CASPT2//CASSCF computations explain this apparent contradiction of the meta&#8208;ortho selectivity rule of Zimmerman, which originates from the substituent effects lowering to a different extent the barrier to populate the prefulvenic conical intersection that deactivates non&#8208;radiatively the singlet excited state of the chloroanilines.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
