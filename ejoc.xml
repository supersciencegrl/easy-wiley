         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Alkynyl Thioamides: An Efficient Thioacylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed efficient synthesis of alkynyl thioamides starting from tetraalkyl thiuram compounds (TMTM: tetramethyl thiuram monosulfide, TIBTM: tetraisobutyl thiuram monosulfide) and alkynes was reported. Thus, tetraalkyl thiurams reacted with alkynes smoothly, giving a variety of alkynyl thioamides promoted by CuI/Cs2CO3 system. This protocol features easy operation, inexpensive starting materials and good yields, illustrating its potential synthetic value for the synthesis of thioamides and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Turnstiles Featuring Bicyclic Rotators: Solution and Solid&#8208;State Investigation of Steric and Electronic Concerns</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular rotor is created when a 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole rotator is incorporated into a rigid arylene ethynylene framework supported by pyridine coordination to a metal (Ag+ or PdCl2) guest. Comparisons to a similarly sized naphthyl rotator via 1H NMR spectroscopy provide insights into the movement of these bicyclic rotators relative to the rigid stator framework. Chemical shift increases of 0.3 ppm, or more, upon metal complexation are consistent with through&#8208;space interaction of the central arene with a bound PdCl2 guest. &#160;Further study via X&#8208;ray crystallography illustrates that rotation of the 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole unit in the solid state is likely hampered by relatively strong chalcogen bonding (N&#8230;S distance of 2.93 &#197;), forming 2S&#8208;2N squares between benzothiadiazoles of neighboring complexes. Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions (3.29&#8208;3.36 &#197;) between neighboring complexes likewise restrict solid&#8208;state rotation of the potential benzothiadiazole rotator. Modest changes to UV&#8208;vis spectra upon metal coordination suggest that electronic properties are mostly independent of stator configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination in the Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination, a coupling reaction between a carbonyl component and a sulfone partner, has been emerged as a powerful synthetic tool in the preparation of several organic compounds. A number of interesting examples involving particularly the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes along with important observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions have been recently reported. This reviewing work covers the literature for the period 2016&#8208;2022 and describes in a comprehensive way the progress and developments of Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination application in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds. Moreover, key methodology results dealing with the investigation of the optimum conditions and stereoselectivities and new modifications and approaches are discussed.</dc:description>

The applicability of this temporal 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;protecting group was demonstrated in the liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis (LPOS) using the corresponding phosphoramidite building blocks (dA, dG, dC and dT) and a tetrapodal precipitative soluble support.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Congested Bis&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Porphyrin Containing a Single Buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne Linkage: From a Serendipitous Finding to Supramolecular Encapsulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zinc&#8208;porphyrin moieties have been covalently attached through a single, rigid buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho position of a meso phenyl ring. Despite of freely rotating around the bis&#8208;alkyne axle, such species is adaptable enough to encapsulate a DABCO molecule with a high association constant (K&gt;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) as supported by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A unique example of a bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin chemical system in which both macrocycles are covalently connected with a single, short buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho sites of the meso phenyl rings is presented. This dimeric compound resulted from an homo&#8208;coupling side&#8208;reaction taking place during a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between an alkyne porphyrin and 2&#8208;azidopyridine derivatives. Its unexpected formation was rationalized by control experiments and an improved synthesis was achieved under copper&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling reaction conditions. This highly sterically congested bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin derivative behaved as a supramolecular host for encapsulating ditopic molecular guests such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with association constant K1.1 in the order of 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. This value is comparable to current systems that typically feature several connecting linkages between the two zinc&#8208;porphyrin sites resulting in (supra)molecular cages ensuring a high pre&#8208;organization. As such, the requirements to take benefit from supramolecular encapsulation can be reduced to a highly rigid, minimal covalent linkage of four atoms between zinc&#8208;porphyrins as herein described.

         <title>Alternative Functionalization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. This work describes an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. One effective strategy demonstrated to improve the performance and morphology of organic solar cells is incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonding units into DPPs. While the functionalization of the DPP lactams and the coupling of aromatic units to the thiophene rings are the most common procedures to tune the properties of such derivatives, modifying the thiophene capping units with hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups is a challenging synthetic task. Despite this difficulty, incorporating amide&#8208;containing substituents into the thiophene rings of single core thiophene&#8208;capped DPP derivatives could yield exciting results, as the advantages of having hydrogen&#8208;bonded &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems based on these modified DPPs have not been explored thoroughly.

&lt;p&gt;Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self-assembly through noncovalent interactions. This work describes an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self-assembly through noncovalent interactions. One effective strategy demonstrated to improve the performance and morphology of organic solar cells is incorporating hydrogen-bonding units into DPPs. While the functionalization of the DPP lactams and the coupling of aromatic units to the thiophene rings are the most common procedures to tune the properties of such derivatives, modifying the thiophene capping units with hydrogen-bonding groups is a challenging synthetic task. Despite this difficulty, incorporating amide-containing substituents into the thiophene rings of single core thiophene-capped DPP derivatives could yield exciting results, as the advantages of having hydrogen-bonded &#960;-conjugated systems based on these modified DPPs have not been explored thoroughly. This work reports on an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Double C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines with 3&#8208;Chloropropiophenones: Selective Access to 2,3,6&#8208;Trisubstituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient de novo access to 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines was successfully synthesized through a mono&#8208; or dialkylation reaction between 4/3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones using DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cheap cooperative basic system and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization in the presence of NH4OAc under an air.







Abstract
An efficient sequential one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step pseudo&#8208;four&#8208;component reaction between 3/4&#8208;methyl N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones triggered by DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cooperative base and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization using NH4OAc is reported. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free technique concocts new C&#8722;C/C=C/C=N&#8722;C bonds selectively, guaranteeing acceptable yields of 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines possessing ortho&#8208;hydroxyaryl/benzenesulfonamide and propiophenone moieties at C2 and C3 positions, respectively. Interestingly, while replacing methyl&#8208;substituents with straight alkyl chains of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, only a monoalkylation reaction happened with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated vinyl ketones to deliver promising yields of 3&#8208;picoline derivatives. Moreover, the synthetic transmutation of prepared pyridine derivative led to several important classes of pyridocoumarin, 5H&#8208;chromenopyridine, and di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl) methane derivatives.

The Front Cover shows the porous organic salt with &#8220;gate&#8208;like&#8221; bottlenecks that exhibits gas separation properties depending on the size of the bottlenecks. Oxygen molecules (shown in red) are smaller than the gate size and can easily get in and out. In contrast, nitrogen molecules (shown in blue) are larger than the gate size and can hardly get in and out. Modulation of the gate size will be one of the triggers of future gas separation (e.g., air, toxics, fuel gas). The cover picture was created by Kouki Oka.

Electrochemical reduction of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;triones, which are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions, unstable dianions, and long&#8208;lived 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one radical dianions, followed by the formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantene&#8208;9&#8208;ones as the final products.







Abstract
A convenient synthetic route was proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione. This compound and its 3&#8208;H congener are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, which can be used as building blocks for materials used in organic electronics. Electrochemical reduction (ECR) of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione and its 3&#8208;methyl derivative in DMF and acetonitrile is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions and unstable dianions at the first and second stages, respectively. In a protolytic equilibrium, dianions are converted into 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one anions. Their one&#8208;electron reversible ECR leads to the corresponding radical dianions, followed by the formation of (3&#8208;methyl/H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantene&#8208;9&#8208;ones as the final products. The latter compounds can be converted into the initial (3&#8208;methyl/H)&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;triones. The main intermediates were characterized using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy, 3D spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations at the (U)B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*/PCM level of theory. A general ECR scheme was proposed for both types of compounds.

         <title>Quantifying the Electronic Effect of C4 and C4' Positions of Bipyridine Ligand on Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition Reaction: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic effects of the bidentate ligands play a vital role in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. Here, the insertion step (rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the conjugate addition) catalyzed by Pd(&#921;I)/Rh(&#921;)&#8208;complexes with 26 bipyridine&#8208;type (bpy) ligands linking different substituent groups in the opposite sides (C4, C4' position) are systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that for both Pd(&#921;I)&#8208; and Rh(&#921;)&#8208;catalysis, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing group connecting to both C4 and C4' positions of bpy ligands can promote the insertion step. The Mayer bond order (MBO) of N1/N1'&#8208;Pd(&#921;I)/Rh(&#921;) as the electronic parameter has been found to enable quantitative determination of the effect of the substituents in C4 or C4' positions of bpy ligand on the activation energy barrier (&#916;Ga) of RDS. The correlation between MBOs and &#916;Ga is positive for Pd(&#921;I)&#8208;catalysis with coefficients of determination R2 = 0.93, while that of Rh(&#921;)&#8208;catalyzed system is negative with R2 = 0.79. The predominance of &#960;&#8208;back donation in Rh(&#921;) and &#963;&#8208;donation in Pd(&#921;I) is the main reason for above different electronic properties of Pd(&#921;I) and Rh(&#921;)&#8208;catalysis. This work gives enough theoretical guide to the rational design of the efficient transition metal&#8208;based catalyst for conjugate addition.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones has been developed, via a visible light&#8208;promoted/ Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8211;alkyne metathesis/transfer hydrogenation one&#8208;pot reaction of benzoquinone, arylalkyne, and Hantzsch ester. A series of synthetically useful triarylethanones and diarylethanones were achieved in excellent yield under mild reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and scalable and has a broad substrate scope. Moreover, this reaction involves the formation of three chemical bonds, namely C=O, C&#8211;C, and C&#8208;H bonds. This feature enables de novo synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones. Additionally, this protocol provides a convenient and practical synthetic route for tamoxifen.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties of Binaphthyl&#8208;Hinged [5]Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, structure, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of two types of shape&#8208;persistent [5]helicenes, hinged by a tethered (&#8208;OCH2CH2O&#8208;) or untethered (&#8208;OCH3) binaphthyl, are reported. The binaphthyl tethering system facilitated an effective Wittig ring&#8208;closure reaction in the synthesis of a macrocyclic precursor, which could be easily converted to the title compound via successive photocyclization. The tethered groups were replaced with untethered &#8208;OCH3 groups by treatment with BBr3 followed by methylation. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the helical structure of the [5]helical moiety with M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicity in R&#8208; and S&#8208;isomer, respectively. Electronic and circular dichroic spectra were recorded in CHCl3. Both compounds exhibited similar spectra, and their longest wavelength absorption band with a low intensity was attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1. These compounds exhibited CPL with higher dissymmetry factors of glum (6.0&#8211;6.8 &#215; 10&#8211;3) than unlocked helicenes. These glum values are attributed to the C2 structure and the selection rule in the excited state, in which the magnetic and electric&#160;transition dipole moments are parallel to each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;fused Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of penta&#8208; and hexahelicenes with terminal thiophene rings is achieved by isomerization of ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted teraryls using F&#252;rstner's method. Best results were obtained with JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of three penta&#8208; and three hexahelicenes containing two terminal thiophene units is described. The syntheses of pentahelicenes consist of 1,4&#8208;bisalkynylation of a benzene precursor and double Suzuki coupling in 2,3&#8208;position to introduce thiophene units. The ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion yielding the final products was achieved with F&#252;rstner's protocol using platinum(II) chloride or JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalysts. A similar approach to hexahelicenes started with a naphthalene derivative, where 2,7&#8208;bisalkynylation and subsequent double Suzuki coupling with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acid at 1,8&#8208;position furnished precursors, in which ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion to the respective hexahelicenes was achieved with platinum(II) chloride or, favourably, with indium(III) chloride. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded for all helicenes and HOMO/LUMO gaps were calculated with DFT methods.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here reported a C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions. The process provided a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
One&#8208;step process for the preparation of a 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester motif from readily available substrate remains a challenging work in organic synthesis. We herein report the first example of C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols, using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions, providing a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.

The concise and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids lycibarbarines A&#8722;C has been accomplished in four steps from a common intermediate derived from commercially available 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline.







Abstract
The concise and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids lycibarbarines A&#8722;C has been accomplished in four steps from a common intermediate derived from commercially available 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. For the synthesis of the unique tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton we employed a synthetic strategy that features two key transformations: iodomethyllithium&#8208;based homologation of lactone / N&#8208;alkylation to access tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton in one step and one&#8208;pot acetonide deprotection, hemiacetal formation, and spirocyclization cascade process.

For the synthesis of the unique tetracyclic spiro-heterocycle skeleton we employed a synthetic strategy that features two key transformations: iodomethyllithium-based homologation of lactone / N-alkylation to access tetracyclic spiro-heterocycle skeleton in one step and one-pot acetonide deprotection, hemiacetal formation, and spirocyclization cascade process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficiently Aerobic Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles and Hydrocarbons over MnAl Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive, simple and green catalytic system has been developed for the aerobic dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons based on MnAl oxides. Good application potential was demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated that dehydrogenation proceeds mainly via an electron transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons provides an important route to corresponding aromatic compounds. Herein, an efficient and selective MnAlO&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, imines and hydrocarbons is presented. The reaction features excellent yields of the products, mild reaction conditions, readily available and reusable catalyst. Various N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons can be tolerated by the reaction system and transformed to the corresponding aromatic counterparts. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction proceeds mainly through an electron transfer mechanism.

         <title>DBS&#8208;based Eutectogels: organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the Michael Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular eutectogels were obtained from the gelation of 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;D&#8208;sorbitol in cholinium chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DES), differing for the nature of the hydrogen bond donor. Ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol and urea were tested. Soft materials were fully characterized, determining critical gelation concentration, gel&#8208;sol transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, to have information about the organization of the gelator in the tridimensional network, resonance light scattering, circular dichroism and polarized optical microscopy investigations were performed. Eutectogels were used as organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the L&#8208;proline catalyzed Michael addition reaction. The probe reaction was carried out in gel phase and in DES solution. Data collected shed light on the effect that gel microenvironment exerts on the outcome of the reaction. In general, gel phases allowed having comparable or even better results than the ones collected in DES solution, with better results obtained in soft materials with the highest organization, as accounted for by the presence of larger aggregates and the occurrence of stronger intermolecular interactions. In turn, this accounts also for the effect of substrates structure that indicates that better yields could be obtained in the presence of more flexible nucleophile and dienones, having more extended p&#8208;surface.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to the high oxidation potentials of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic hydrocarbons, it is difficult to achieve the direct oxidative C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds functionalizations of such substrates. Herein, we develop a Ritter&#8208;type amination of electron&#8208;deficient aromatics by merging electricity and sulfate. This practical and straightforward method provides a series of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted arenes (22 examples, up to 75%) with moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This method is characterized by cheap and readily available regents, atom and step economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Berkeleylactone A by Ring Closing Alkyne Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new route to the macrolactone antibiotic berkeleylactone A was developed. As a key step, a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) of an ester substrate featuring 1&#8208;propynyl termini was used. The carboxylic part of the substrate was easily assembled using alkyne chemistry, like carboxylation of a diyne followed by isomerization of the ynoate section to a dienoate and dihydroxylation of the 4,5&#8208;double bond. The synthesis of the alcohol part of the ester started with opening of (R)&#8208;propylene oxide with an acetylide and was followed by two triple bond migrations. After successful RCAM which formed the C8&#8208;C9 bond, the triple bond was selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding alkene before the 4,5&#8208;diol was oxidized to the 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;oxo derivative. At this stage, the thioether was formed and the 8,9&#8208;double bond reduced. We also prepared the 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog of berkeleylactone A. However, it turned out that its antibacterial activity was slightly reduced.</dc:description>

Preliminary mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analysis shed the light on the reaction mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described. This transformation enables the formation of new C(sp3)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds via the selection of different oxidation conditions. The features of this method include tunable product selectivity, excellent chemoselectivity, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, and moderate to high yields.

         <title>Chiral Organocatalysts in Enantioselective CO2 Utilization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of efficient CO2 utilization reactions has gained a significant amount of attention in recent years. Although transformations of CO2 to produce basic chemicals have been extensively investigated, the development of catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions for the preparation of fine chemicals remains limited at this stage. Several excellent methods for catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization using chiral metal complex catalysts have been reported. Many researchers have also focused on developing organocatalyzed approaches to enantioselective CO2 utilization, and several excellent examples have appeared in recent years. Herein, recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts are reviewed to provide a forecast for organocatalyzed enantioselective CO2 utilization research.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Chemoselectivity in the PBu3&#8208;Catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Chalcone with Ethyl Acrylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origins of regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cross Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction of chalcone with ethyl acrylate have been theoretically investigated.







Abstract
Disclosing the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier (R&#8722;C) reaction remains a challenge. Here, a comprehensive study on the possible mechanisms and origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of PBu3&#8208;catalyzed R&#8722;C reactions between ethyl acrylate and chalcone is performed by DFT. Both cross and homo R&#8722;C reactions are investigated and compared. The computational results show that the cross R&#8722;C reaction is energetically favorable than the homo R&#8722;C reaction, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail product being generated preferentially. Moreover, the C&#8722;C bond formation process is identified to be the regioselectivity&#8208; and chemoselectivity&#8208;determining step. The CDFT and Parr function analyses are successfully used to predict the origins of chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, respectively. This work would provide a valuable case for exploring the origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the phosphine catalyzed reactions, which should be helpful to understand and control the selectivities by rational design.

         <title>Acid Catalyzed Multicomponent Reaction to Access Functionalized N&#8208;Benzhydryl Amides: A Tandem Ritter Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of sterically hindered N&#8208;benzhydryl amide derivatives is reported. The tandem Ritter reaction demonstrated broad scope, atom economy and bond forming efficiency. The highly functionalized amide products have potential for further useful transformations.







Abstract
Acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of N&#8208;benzhydryl amide derivatives from aldehydes, N,N&#8208;disubstituted arylamines and nitriles is reported. The reaction is compatible with electronically differentiating aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes/acetals, different nucleophiles (cyclic and acyclic N,N&#8208;disubstituted arylamines,&#946;&#8208;naphthols, 1,3 dicarbonyl, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxy benzene), alkyl nitriles, aryl/heteroaryl nitriles in catalytic TFA/TfOH through tandem Ritter reaction. The one&#8208;pot MCR with broad substrate scope generated a wide variety of sterically hindered N&#8208;substituted amides and is successfully applied for the synthesis of isoindolinone.

     alt="Acid Catalyzed Multicomponent Reaction to Access Functionalized N-Benzhydryl Amides: A Tandem Ritter Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of sterically hindered N-benzhydryl amide derivatives is reported. The tandem Ritter reaction demonstrated broad scope, atom economy and bond forming efficiency. The highly functionalized amide products have potential for further useful transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acid catalyzed multicomponent reaction (MCR) for the synthesis of N-benzhydryl amide derivatives from aldehydes, N,N-disubstituted arylamines and nitriles is reported. The reaction is compatible with electronically differentiating aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes/acetals, different nucleophiles (cyclic and acyclic N,N-disubstituted arylamines,&#946;-naphthols, 1,3 dicarbonyl, 1,3,5-trimethoxy benzene), alkyl nitriles, aryl/heteroaryl nitriles in catalytic TFA/TfOH through tandem Ritter reaction. The one-pot MCR with broad substrate scope generated a wide variety of sterically hindered N-substituted amides and is successfully applied for the synthesis of isoindolinone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluation of the Stereochemical Lability of Benzo&#8208;Cycloheptene&#8208;Based Drugs Endowed with Potentially Modulable Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tendence of some popular chiral drugs (endowed with tricyclic&#8208;structures characterized by stereogenic&#8208;plane) to underwent racemization by flipping of their chiral&#8208;plane has been investigated by resorting to both experimental and theoretical approach. The obtained results suggested which structural modifications can be rationally designed in order to modulate their intrinsic stereolability, so allowing to suitably increase their enantiomerization barrier.







Abstract
An experimental and theoretical study was carried out to analyze the configurational lability possessed by some of the most common drugs endowed with a central non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered cycloheptadiene ring, which confers chirality to these compounds. In fact, the absence of planarity allows the existence of two enantiomeric species that can interconvert thanks to a ring overturning mechanism. The energy barrier that opposes the inversion of the chiral tricyclic scaffold characterizing such species, which is strongly dependent on the presence of appropriate substituents on the two external cycles, has been investigated through Dynamic&#8208;HPLC and off&#8208;column racemization techniques, as well as through assessments based on molecular modelling approaches. Interesting indications were obtained by making targeted structural changes to allow accurate control of the stereolability characterizing the tricyclic framework.

         <dc:description>This work describes an effective method to obtain chiral vinyl cyclopentenols with a high degree of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity through Heck desymmetrization of cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethanol using vinyl triflates as coupling agents and chiral N,N ligands. This Heck vinylation protocol allowed the synthesis of several structurally complex cyclopentenols in isolated yields of up to 80% in enantiomeric ratios of up to 97:3 and diastereoselectivities higher than 20:1 in most cases.&#160;Experiments using (E) or (Z) vinyl triflates, and desymmetrization of protected olefin 1&#8208;(cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrobenzene (17) were instrumental in rationalizing the observed diastereoselectivities of Heck products involving the interaction of vinyl triflate carbonyl and the hydroxyl group moiety of the substrate with the cationic Pd(II) complex.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Oxyacetoxylation of Arylynamines and Ynamides To Construct &#945;&#8208;Acetoxyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines and ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides highly regio&#8208; and chemoselectively in good to excellent yields, leaving the N&#8208;heteroaryl rings intact, is reported.







Abstract
Ynamides/arylynamines are challenging substrates for oxyacetoxylation, especially due to various reactive sites of the N&#8208;heteroaryl ring. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines/ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides in good to excellent yields. The transformation completes in a short time to afford solely the product in a highly regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner through &#946;&#8208;iodo keteneiminium intermediate, without functionalising the N&#8208;heteroaryl moiety.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Alkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with sulfamates allows to functionalize alkanes used as the limiting component, selectively at tertiary centers. Valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks can be isolated in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
The development of an efficient catalytic system enabling the conversion of alkanes to valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks is reported. Light alkanes can be selectively functionalized by an intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reaction that proceeds at room temperature in the presence of only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a dirhodium(II) complex. Selective amination of tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H within acyclic or cyclic alkanes used as limiting components leads to the corresponding amides isolated with yields in the 51&#8211;96&#8201;% range. The reaction, that can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, applies with equal levels of efficiency and selectivity to more complex hydrocarbons.

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase IRED, NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Reductive Amination in Organocatalysis and Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. The current challenges and opportunities in organocatalytic and biocatalytic ARA are also discussed.







Abstract
This review summarizes the recent progress of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA), a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis, and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually Hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.

         <title>Reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination of Nitroarenes with Aryl (pseudo)Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is developed. The use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinaco&#8208;lato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of this protocol.







Abstract
De novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is described. The exquisite use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, and wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of the current protocol. Moreover, application of this technique to the syntheses of advanced intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients also proved successful, thus providing an alternative step&#8208;economical approach to the syntheses of diarylamine&#8208;incorporated molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigation demonstrates that an amine and a nitrosoarene intermediates might be involved in this reductive event.

The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, is described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature.

Abstract
The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, has been described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The palladium catalysts, previously discovered and reported by Sodeoka, are easily prepared in two steps from PdCl2(MeCN)2. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7, the reaction being more efficient using electron&#8208;rich aldehydes.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot procedure for the difunctionalization of alkynes by C&#8722;C triple bond oxidation and transformation towards chromone derivatives has been developed. It involves cascade reactions for carbonylation of alkynes, base&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage, and intramolecular cyclization. This procedure provides an efficient protocol for the synthesis of polysubstituted chromones from readily available starting materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Diacetoxylation of Styrenes Mediated by Chiral Iodoarene Catalyst
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an asymmetric electrosynthetic reaction mediated by a catalytic amount of chiral iodoarene has been accomplished. Important aspects of the design of such transformations are disclosed, providing guidance for the development of novel enantioselective iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed processes promoted electrochemically.







Abstract
Organocatalysis with chiral iodoarenes has emerged as a powerful approach for performing enantioselective transformations. However, it suffers from the need to utilize stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids or similar high energy oxidants. Electrosynthesis enables eliminating stoichiometric redox reagents by replacing them with electric stimuli. In this context, an electrochemically&#8208;promoted variant of the chiral iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric diacetoxylation of styrenes was evaluated. The screening of reaction parameters established a set of conditions under which, for the first time, an enantioselective electrochemical oxidation mediated by a chiral iodoarene achieving a catalytic turnover has been accomplished. The reaction was applied for the synthesis of an array of products in 15&#8211;60&#8201;% yields and 0&#8211;84&#8201;% ee. The modest efficiency of the electrocatalysis was traced to a partial direct oxidation of styrene substrates leading to racemic products and undesired dimeric side&#8208;products. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that such outcome originates from a somewhat difficult electrochemical oxidation of the applied iodoarene catalyst. Present work provides important insights and implications for the design of more efficient electrocatalytic systems employing chiral iodoarenes as mediators.

Important aspects of the design of such transformations are disclosed, providing guidance for the development of novel enantioselective iodoarene-catalyzed processes promoted electrochemically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organocatalysis with chiral iodoarenes has emerged as a powerful approach for performing enantioselective transformations. However, it suffers from the need to utilize stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids or similar high energy oxidants. Electrosynthesis enables eliminating stoichiometric redox reagents by replacing them with electric stimuli. In this context, an electrochemically-promoted variant of the chiral iodoarene-catalyzed asymmetric diacetoxylation of styrenes was evaluated. The screening of reaction parameters established a set of conditions under which, for the first time, an enantioselective electrochemical oxidation mediated by a chiral iodoarene achieving a catalytic turnover has been accomplished. The reaction was applied for the synthesis of an array of products in 15&#8211;60&#8201;% yields and 0&#8211;84&#8201;% ee. The modest efficiency of the electrocatalysis was traced to a partial direct oxidation of styrene substrates leading to racemic products and undesired dimeric side-products. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that such outcome originates from a somewhat difficult electrochemical oxidation of the applied iodoarene catalyst. Present work provides important insights and implications for the design of more efficient electrocatalytic systems employing chiral iodoarenes as mediators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blue&#8208;LED Synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones by Peroxidase&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Substituted Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Horseradish peroxidase activated by hydroperoxide of 2&#8208;MeTHF catalyzes the synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones under blue&#8208;LED Photon irradiation in the presence of meso&#8208;TPP. Lignin nanoparticles worked as an electroactive platform in improving the activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
Pummerer's ketones resembling the tricyclic scaffold of bioactive natural substances were synthesized by blue&#8208;LED driven Horseradish Peroxidase oxidative coupling of substituted phenols in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran by using meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin as photosensitizer and dioxygen as primary oxidant. The application of functionalized lignin nanoparticles as a renewable and efficient platform for the immobilization of the enzyme extended the effectiveness of the overall process to heterogeneous catalysis under buffer limiting conditions.

         <title>Lateral Deprotometallation&#8208;Trapping Reactions on Methylated Pyridines, Quinolines and Quinoxalines Using Lithium Diethylamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of methylated azines and diazines has aroused the interest of chemists given the structural diversity that it affords. Hindered lithium dialkylamides have in particular been used to deprotometallate these substrates chemoselectively. In contrast, it can be observed that, despite some promising work, lithium diethylamide has been used very little for this purpose. Our objective here is on the one hand to make an inventory of what reagents have been used to deprotometallate methylpyridines, &#8208;quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines, and on the other hand to describe the results obtained by seeking to functionalize a series of substrates with lithium diethylamide (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline). Our efforts to take advantage of the use of an in&#8208;situ trap (a zinc chloride chelate) in these reactions are also described.</dc:description>

         <title>Diols Speed Up Guanidine Base Catalysed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt Condensation to Produce New 15&#8208;Arylidene Steroids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considerable acceleration was observed in the guanidine&#8208;base catalysed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and a 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;5&#945;,13&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;16&#8208;one (1) in the presence of ethylene glycol. Rate&#8208;enhancement effects of various alcohols and diols were compared. In quantum chemical calculations, coordination of the carbonyl group of the substrate was found to reduce the potential barrier to the proton transfer from the &#945; carbon and thus facilitate the formation of the anion that attacks the aldehyde. Both the experiments and the calculations showed that diols enhance the reactivity more efficiently than alcohols. Ethylene glycol/guanidine&#8208;base mixtures were found to be efficient catalysts and solvents in the synthesis of a range of new 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;13&#945;&#8208;15&#8208;arylidene steroids. This solvent mixture has a further advantage: the crude products can be isolated by simple extraction after introduction of CO2. It is also shown that by the proper choice of the base, the base/diol mixture can be recycled.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Imines by Aluminum Hydride Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the catalytic activity of electronically unsaturated three coordinated aluminum hydride cations [LAlH]+[HB(C6F5)3]&#8208; (1) and [LAlH]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8208; (2) in hydrosilylation of imines has been disclosed (L = {(2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3N)P(Ph2)}2N). A variety of organo&#8208;silanes such as Et3SiH, MePhSiH2, PhSiH3, TMDSO, and PHMS are screened in this endeavour. The amines as products of catalysis and subsequent hydrolysis were obtained in good to excellent yields. Further, a series of controlled experiments systematically designed to investigate the underlying mechanistic pathway through multinuclear NMR analysis showed Lewis adduct formation between cationic aluminum centre and the imine nitrogen, which subsequently undergoes reaction with silane to afford the product. The hydrosilylation of imine performed with Et3SiH using catalyst 1 with a loading of 2 mol% at 60 oC occurs smoothly. Whereas 2 led to the product formation with Et3SiH only when used in stoichiometric quantity. Further, to investigate this unique behaviour of 1 NMR investigations were performed and revealed that the anion in 1 competes for hydride delivery and also in&#8208;situ generates B(C6F5)3 that cooperatively reinforces the catalytic activity of 1.</dc:description>

Abstract
Regioselective synthesis of N&#8208;fused benzimidazo&#8208;indolo&#8208;isoquinoline heterocycles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino coupling reaction of 1&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazoles and aryl halides was developed. This one pot methodology proceeded via a five&#8208;member carbopalladacycle intermediate and provided direct and facile route to access structurally complex polyheterocycles in moderate to good yields. These unique hybrid molecules resembled structural similarity with naturally isolated alkaloids. Notably, the present domino process occurred through activation of three C&#8722;H bonds and the simultaneous formation of two new C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;shot. These molecules exhibited strong solid and solution phase fluorescence and their emission spectra in both the medium are reported here.

Different approaches currently used to introduce the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl moiety onto pyrimidine&#8208;based deoxynucleosides were reinvestigated. The oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by the reduction of the resulting formyl group allowed access to protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine in a simple way and in good yields. Examples of application to the synthesis of relevant building blocks are presented.







Abstract
5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;based nucleobases have attracted attention in the last years due to their important role in gene regulation. It prompted the development of efficient routes to the corresponding nucleoside building blocks for further incorporation into oligonucleotides. Several pathways have been employed in recent years to access properly protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine based nucleosides, including hydroxymethylation of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine, radical bromination of thymidine followed by bromine substitution, or carbonylative coupling through Stille conditions starting from 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine. In this study, we review the different approaches currently used to introduce the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl moiety, we reinvestigate some of them, and finally, we propose an alternative route based on the oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by its reduction that allows access to protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine in a simple way with good yields. Finally, we present some examples of application including the synthesis of base J and 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;Substituted Pyrazoles from MBH Acetates via Allyl Hydrazone Intermediate</title>

A one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;pyrazoles through a iodine&#8208;mediated reaction between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman acetates and hydrazines via intermediacy of allyl hydrazone is described.







Abstract
Herein, we report the regioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrazoles by reacting Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) acetates derived from aryl aldehydes with alkyl or aryl hydrazines in the presence of iodine under aerobic conditions. The reaction proceeds through sequential SN2&#8242; nucleophilic substitution of substituted hydrazine onto the MBH acetate, I2&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the allylic hydrazine to allylic hydrazone, heating&#8208;induced intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction and cyclization, and oxidative aromatization. The key intermediate, the s&#8208;trans allyl hydrazones were isolated in good yields by performing the reactions at room temperature. However, the allyl hydrazones prepared from the MBH acetates of aliphatic aldehydes did not furnish the pyrazole owing to the absence of an activated methylene group in the substrate. The synthetic applications of the pyrazoles in Ugi reactions, decarboxylative halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed benzoylation of the N&#8208;aryl ring, and metal&#8208;free tetrazole synthesis has been demonstrated.

A diastereoselective and enantioselective formal [4+1] ylide annulation of chiral sulfonium salts with various substituted Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts leading to optically active isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides. The enantioselective [4+1] annulations give a variety of multifunctional isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides with three chiral carbon centers under mild conditions.







Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective formal [4+1] ylide annulation of chiral sulfonium salts with various substituted Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts leading to optically active isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides with three chiral carbon centers has been explored. The salient features of this methodology include a high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective transformation, easily accessible starting materials, and mild reaction conditions. In addition, the isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides products can be conveniently transformed into functionalized compounds.

         <title>Bimetallic Al(III) Compounds as Catalysts for the Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyesters and Polycarbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 28, July 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proligands on reaction with trimethylaluminum (AlMe3) resulted in the formation of dinuclear aluminum compounds, where the ligand moieties resemble N&#8208;alkylated salan. The aluminum compounds were active towards the ROP of rac&#8208;LA and ROCOP of CHO and CO2 and ROCOP of epoxides (CHO, PO, tBuGE) with phthalic anhydride.







Abstract
Ethylenediamine bridged benzoxazine proligands were synthesized by a modified Mannich condensation reaction. The reaction of the proligands with two equivalents of AlMe3 resulted in the formation of dinuclear Al(III) compounds in high yield and purity. When the ligand binds to the Al(III) center, it forms two separate six&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;chelates with the two Al atoms that resembles the N&#8208;alkylated salan moiety. Each aluminum atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry as revealed from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 1. The catalytic activity of these aluminum compounds was investigated towards the ROP of rac&#8208;LA and ROCOP of epoxides (PO, CHO, tBuGE) and phthalic anhydride and ROCOP of CHO with CO2. These aluminum compounds showed notable catalytic activity towards the ROP and ROCOP reactions in the absence of cocatalyst.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of 4&#8208;Azafluorenone Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 28, July 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous approaches to 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloid syntheses featuring 2&#8208;arylnicotinates are supplemented with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide&#8208;mediated radical cyclization and/or bromine substituents as latent hydroxy groups which allows for flexible synthesis of highly oxygenated 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids, including 5&#8208;oxygenated derivatives inaccessible via conventional Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization of 2&#8208;arylnicotinates. Eleven examples are presented including 5 first total synthesis.







Abstract
4&#8208;Azafluorenones are typically obtained by acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;arylnicotinates. However, this approach fails to give 5&#8208;oxygenated 4&#8208;azafluorenones due to lactonization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkoxy)phenylnicotinate intermediates. Herein, we report two modifications of established approaches to 4&#8208;azafluorenone synthesis that, either in combination or by themselves, enable the flexible preparation of 4&#8208;azafluorenones with diverse oxygenation patterns in the benzenoid ring. Undesired lactonization was circumvented via tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)&#8208;mediated radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)pyridines. In the absence of suitable protecting groups for phenolic intermediates, bromide substituents were regioselectively introduced as latent hydroxy groups and later converted under palladium catalysis. We present the first total syntheses of five 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids muniranine, darienine, 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxyonychine, 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetramethoxyonychine, and 6,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxyonychine in addition to new total syntheses of six 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids and one related pyridocoumarin alkaloid.

The Cu(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling reaction of secondary alkyl sulfonates with RLi&#8208;based reagents prepared by transmetalation with soluble MgBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 in THF proceeded with inversion of the configuration. RLi examined were nBuLi, sBuLi, and Ph(CH2)4Li. In contrast, soluble MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF2 in THF was suited for MeLi. (S)&#8208;14&#8208;Methyloctadecan&#8208;2&#8208;one, a sex pheromone produced by lichen moths, was synthesized.







Abstract
The Cu(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl coupling reaction of a secondary substrate MeCH(OSO2Py)CH2CH2C6H4(4&#8208;OMe) with a nBuLi&#8208;based reagent prepared by transmetalation with MgBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 in THF produced a coupling product in 74&#8201;% yield. The use of soluble MgBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 in THF was required for this reaction. This method was applied to sBuLi and Ph(CH2)4Li. In contrast, transmetalation of MeLi with soluble MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF2 in THF produced the Me reagent, which was reactive for the coupling reaction. The reaction proceeded with inversion of the stereogenic carbon. Furthermore, (S)&#8208;14&#8208;methyloctadecan&#8208;2&#8208;one, a sex pheromone produced by lichen moths, was synthesized.

         <title>Tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 28, July 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different hats of an old phosphane: P(bpi)3, a bulky phosphane, has been prepared using a Grignard reagent in diglyme. The phosphane has been further used to prepare phosphazenes and phosphonium cations. Protonation of P(bpi)3 and deprotonation of some phosphonium cations led to P&#8722;N heterocycles via an H&#8208;atom transfer. pKaH values in MeCN and THF were measured or predicted.







Abstract
A new group of bases with benzophenoneiminyl (bpi) moiety has been synthesized and characterized in this work. The title compound tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane (P(bpi)3) 1 was prepared with a convenient one&#8208;pot approach: benzophenone imine was deprotonated using MeMgCl and reacted with PBr3 in diglyme. The method could be considered as a method of choice for preparing other (amino)phosphanes in case lithio&#8208;intermediates and/or protonated phosphane is out of consideration. Phosphane 1 is further used to prepare a range of related phosphonium cations and phosphazenes. Phosphonium cations were deprotonated to assess the stability of the resulting phosphonium ylides. In some cases, the bulky substances were capable of forming P&#8722;N heterocycles. Experimental (MeCN) and computational (MeCN, THF, gas&#8208;phase) basicities of benzophenone imine, phosphane 1, phosphonium ylides, and phosphazenes, as well as some representative XRD structures, are presented and discussed.

         <title>Stereocomplementary Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Propanamines by Enzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 28, July 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;reductive amination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal derivatives was developed to access a range of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl propanamines with excellent conversion and enantioselectivity (90&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% ee). Two 3&#8208;methylindolines were obtained through a Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination and deallylation, providing an effective method to construct this class of pharmaceutically important compounds.







Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;aryl propanamine is an important structure unit of bioactive molecules or drugs. But its efficient synthesis remains a challenging task. In this study, several enantiocomplementary imine reductases capable of dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;reductive amination of sixteen 2&#8208;phenylpropanal derivatives of diverse structural characteristics with four different amines were identified through screening 196 imine reductases. Furthermore, (S)&#8208;IR60, (R)&#8208;IR74 and (R)&#8208;IR207 were applied to access a series of different &#946;&#8208;aryl propanamines with excellent ee values (90 to 99&#8201;%) and high isolated yields (36 to 79&#8201;%), and two of them were further transformed into 3&#8208;methylindolines through intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling and deallylation, providing an effective method to construct this class of pharmaceutically important compounds.

         <title>PCCP&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Allenes Bearing Heteroaromatic Sulfenyl Group
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, one&#8208;step Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed reaction of propargyl alcohol derivatives with heterocyclic thiols was performed with the aid of pentacarboxycyclopenatadiene (PCCP) catalyst. This reported approach provides an access to tetrasubstituted allenes substituted with heterocyclic thioethers in good to excellent yield under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We report a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenyl compounds decorated with heterocyclic sulfenyl group. The reaction proceeds readily from available propargylic alcohols in the presence of pentacarboxycyclopenatadienes (PCCPs) as organocatalysts. The developed strategy provides tetrasubstituted allene derivatives in high yields (from 55 to 98&#8201;%) and under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Evolution of Phosphite&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands for the Pd&#8208;Allylic Substitution and Their Application in Building Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept provides an overview of the evolution in the ligand design of biaryl phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the asymmetric Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution. In addition, the effectiveness of this approach in the construction of chiral bi&#8208; and tricyclic complex molecules is also summarized.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) is a highly effective method for producing chiral molecules with alkene&#8208;substituted frameworks which can be further derivatized. However, its stereochemical outcome is affected by the steric requirements of the substrate and only a narrow set of nucleophiles yield excellent enantioselectivities. In this regard, phosphite&#8208;oxazolines have emerged as strong candidates to be privileged ligands for this process, providing results that surpass most of the previously published studies. They have provided high enantiocontrol when used in the Pd&#8208;AAS of several hindered and unhindered substrates, using a wide range of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;nucleophiles. In this concept, we review and discuss the current progress made in the design of tailor&#8208;made phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the Pd&#8208;AAS of a broad range of substrates and nucleophiles and its application in the construction of chiral complex molecules.

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Reactions of Alkylzinc Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkylzinc halides to imines has been studied under different conditions. Whereas Mannich&#8208;type reactions with sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating, the use N&#8208;alkyl imines required an additional activation: the use of acetyl chloride led to the preparation of N&#8208;acyl tertiary amines whereas trimethylsilyl chloride afforded a direct access to unprotected secondary amines.







Abstract
Mannich&#8208;type reactions involving alkylzinc reagents have been developed using different strategies. We show that the addition of these organometallic species to sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating and affords Mannich products in moderate to excellent yields (14 examples, 30&#8211;99&#8201;%). Interestingly, N&#8208;alkyl imines were also found to be suitable partners after activation as an acyliminium by acetyl chloride (12 examples, 49&#8211;86&#8201;%) or, more originally, by TMSCl (14 examples, 26&#8211;87&#8201;%). These methods proved complementary, leading to the preparation of both N&#8208;protected secondary or tertiary amines and N&#8208;unprotected secondary amines in good yields, with an increased eco&#8208;compatibility, and under simple conditions.

         <title>Pd(II)/Lewis Acid Catalyzed Intramolecular Oxidative C&#8211;H Amination to Construct Carbazoles with Dioxygen</title>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8211;H amination reactions are among the most attractive topics in organic synthesis to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs. The challenge is that most of these reactions employed stoichiometric oxidants to achieve satisfied catalytic efficiencies. Herein, we report a Pd(II)/LA&#8208;catalyzed (LA: Lewis acid) oxidative C&#8210;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles by using dioxygen balloon as the sole oxidant source, and the presence of LA sharply improved the catalytic efficiency of Pd(OAc)2. Remarkably, in certain cases, the deacetylation of the annulation product happened under standard conditions to afford free carbazoles as the final product. The H/D exchange studies confirmed the reversibility of C&#8211;H activation and also disclosed multiple C&#8211;H activation sites by using &#8211;NAc and &#8211;NTs as the directing groups. In addition, the palladacycle compound was identified through 1H NMR characterizations and proved to be the intermediate prior to the carbazole formation.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Aldehydes and Ketones with Transient Directing Groups: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of aldehydes and ketones has recently significantly grown thanks to a concept of transient directing group. In this strategy, the directing group is generated in&#8197;situ which limits the functional group manipulation as well as allows new reactivities. This review presents the latest research works carried out in this area over the period 2020&#8211;2023.







Abstract
In order to directly functionalize C&#8722;H bonds of complex molecules and, in particular, to control the regioselectivity of the reaction, a wide range of directing groups has been used. However, these directing groups need to be installed and removed for further applications, which may limit the use of C&#8722;H activation in synthesis. Concerning aldehydes and ketones, a transient directing group strategy has recently emerged to overcome this drawback.

     alt="C&#8722;H Functionalization of Aldehydes and Ketones with Transient Directing Groups: Recent Developments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of aldehydes and ketones has recently significantly grown thanks to a concept of transient directing group. In this strategy, the directing group is generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; which limits the functional group manipulation as well as allows new reactivities. This review presents the latest research works carried out in this area over the period 2020&#8211;2023.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to directly functionalize C&#8722;H bonds of complex molecules and, in particular, to control the regioselectivity of the reaction, a wide range of directing groups has been used. However, these directing groups need to be installed and removed for further applications, which may limit the use of C&#8722;H activation in synthesis. Concerning aldehydes and ketones, a transient directing group strategy has recently emerged to overcome this drawback. The addition of an additive, in general an amine, allowed the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; formation of the real directing group to achieve C&#8722;H activation. This review presents the latest developments in the field over the period 2020&#8211;2023.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigations into the Aqueous Synthesis of Selenoglycoconjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation of bioactive molecules has been found to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the parent molecule. However, their syntheses often require tedious protecting group manipulations. The development of methodologies which allow direct aqueous conversion of unprotected sugars into glycosides is therefore an ambitious goal. Herein, we present a broadly applicable method for the synthesis of selenoglycosides in water. We show the ease of direct conjugation of unprotected glycosyl diselenides with various biomolecules, including resorcinol, resveratrol, and the antitumor agent, gimeracil, furnishing the corresponding selenoglycoconjugates in up to 96% yield. We also demonstrate the oxidatively&#8208;triggered release of the bioactive drug from the sugar, priming these molecules for medicinal applications. The generality and broad substrate scope of this novel transformation will provide access to various selenium&#8208;containing glycomimetics and glycoconjugates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Smaller cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids have garnered much attention for use as drugs, but their chemical synthesis is extremely challenging.

The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed arylation and benzylation at the remote &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(2) position of the aryl ring in tyrosines and the assembling of C(2) arylated and benzylated tyrosines are reported.

Abstract
This paper describes Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed intermolecular arylation and benzylation of remote &#948;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond (C(2) position) of the aryl ring in tyrosine derivatives and expansion of the library of unnatural tyrosine. Various racemic and enantiopure bis C(2) (ortho C&#8722;H) arylated and benzylated tyrosine derivatives were assembled in good yields. Removal of the picolinoyl moiety after the C(2)&#8722;H arylation and assembling of tyrosine&#8208;based peptides using C(2)&#8722;H arylated tyrosines were shown. Tyrosine derivatives and biaryl amino acids are vital scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Correspondingly, this work is a contribution towards the expansion of the unnatural tyrosine library with biaryl&#8208; or terphenyl and diarylmethane&#8208;based tyrosine scaffolds.

         <title>Construction of Polyheterocyclic Compounds by Lewis Acid Mediated Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo&#8208;fused polyheterocyclic compounds from 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 1,4&#8208;benzoxazinones via intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition has been demonstrated. The protocol obviates column chromatography and products were isolated in good to excellent yields by simple filtration. Electronic effects of both electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are well tolerated.







Abstract
An efficient domino approach has been developed for the synthesis of polyheterocyclic derivatives constituting pyrrole moiety. Lewis acid catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 1,4&#8208;benzoxazinone derivatives resulted in the formation of polyheterocyclic compounds under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in good to excellent yield. The reaction is highly regioselective for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond construction proceeded via intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The protocol is highly efficient, obviates column chromatography and the products are obtained by simple filtration followed by washing with solvent.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Olefins with Aliphatic Amines without Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins with aliphatic amines was successfully performed without acidic additives. Despite the strong basicity of the nucleophiles, targeted amide derivatives of styrene, oct&#8208;1&#8208;ene and isoprene were obtained with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Mechanistic considerations were made supported by experimental observations.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation reactions of olefins using aliphatic amines were performed under carbon monoxide atmosphere. Despite the strong basicity of the applied nucleophiles, the targeted amides were successfully synthesized in the absence of acidic additives. Styrene, oct&#8208;1&#8208;ene and isoprene were transformed to the corresponding amide isomers in moderate to good isolated yields under optimized reaction conditions. Various aliphatic amines were used as N&#8208;nucleophiles. The effect of chiral diphosphines on product distribution, that is, on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities was also studied. Plausible explanation was given for the additive&#8208;free hydroaminocarbonylation reaction.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Phosphite and Phosphoramidite Ligands for Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the applications of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands synthesized by different modules in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. It provides ideas for the design, synthesis, and application of modular ligands synthesis for hydroformylation reactions.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins is an important method for synthesizing aldehydes, and it is worth noting that regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the product controlled by ligand are the most commonly used strategies. The modular synthesis of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands have significant advantages of simple synthesis and high catalytic activity, which was why these ligands have been widely used in hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we focus on the synthesis methods and design ideas of such ligands, as well as their application effects in hydroformylation reactions. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and synthesis of ligands in hydroformylation subsequently.

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an unprecedented synthesis of difluoromethoxylated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks. Pyrazoles, isoxazoles and pyrimidines could be obtained via an enaminone intermediate, whereas in the direct reaction of &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones with arylhydrazines, a Fischer indole synthesis was achieved. All these scaffolds, which are uncommon, or even sometimes novel, due to the directly attached emerging fluorinated group (EFG) &#8208;OCF2H, might be of high potential in life sciences and appear as an interesting alternative to more and more controversial classical fluorinated groups, such as the ubiquitous trifluoromethyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C2&#8208;Functionalized Pyrimidine Derivatives by Using Arynes and Dithiopyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for synthesizing C2 functionalized pyrimidine derivatives by phenylalkyne and pyrimidine disulfide under environmental conditions with good group compatibility is reported. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that it is more advantageous to generate C2&#8208;functionalized pyrimidine derivatives.







Abstract
C2&#8208;functionalized pyrimidine derivative is a family of important nitrogen heterocyclic compounds due to their unique structure and multiple reaction sites. In this work, a novel method for the synthesis of C2&#8208;functionalized pyrimidine derivatives through phenylalkynes and pyrimidine disulfides under ambient conditions is proposed. The reaction can be triggered by adding catalytic amounts of cesium fluoride, which is characterized by free&#8208;catalyst and special activator. Importantly, this reaction has good compatibility with substrates substituted by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also indicates that the production of C2&#8208;functionalized pyrimidine derivatives is more favourable.

         <title>Pyrazine Derivative as Supramolecular Host for Immobilization of Palladium Nanoparticles for Efficient Suzuki Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular palladium catalyst PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd has been synthesized using a convenient strategy through coordination between pyrazine host PYZ&#8208;TA and co&#8208;released PdNPs under standard Suzuki conditions. The catalytic efficiency of PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd was further explored in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with a variety of aryl halides and aryl boronic acids/aryl boronic acid pinacol esters. The excellent yield of the final products and their easy separation highlights the efficiency of the solid catalyst.







Abstract
Palladium nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively explored as unique catalyst for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions. Nonetheless, because of extreme tendency of nanoparticles to undergo agglomeration, the immobilization of these metal NPs on organic frameworks is an important area of research. The present investigation demonstrates the synthesis of pyrazine derivative PYZ&#8208;TA as a supramolecular host for holding co&#8208;released Pd NPs derived from the original catalyst (Pd(II)) under standard Suzuki coupling. Unprecedent, physical bars are not required to capture Pd NPs within the pores of supramolecular host. The as obtained catalyst PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd exhibits high potential to undergo self&#8208;assembly in solid as well as in liquid state. The PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd ensemble shows high catalytic activity and recyclability (up to seven cycles) in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions using low palladium loading and provides the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). Therefore, this study provides an efficient strategy to develop an easy to synthesize palladium centered solid catalyst through coordination between organic host and Pd NPs.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Quinacridone Photocatalysts for the Homogeneous Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, quinacridone (QA) functionalization with EWG groups and N&#8208;alkylation is described, in order to improve QA solubility and photocatalytic oxidizing activity. The synthesized derivatives acted as efficient photocatalysts in the selective aerobic oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Remarkably, N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;quinacridone (DBQA) showed the best performances, leading to quantitative thioanisole conversion to sulfoxide in 20 minutes.







Abstract
Evaluation of quinacridone (QA) derivatives as homogeneous metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is here presented. QA derivatives were synthetized and systematically characterized, measuring their ground state and excited state redox potentials in dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), in order to understand how structural modifications influenced their photocatalytic properties. In particular, the effect of dicyanomethylene and nitro EWG groups was investigated, in order to develop a photocatalyst capable of promoting oxidative processes in the presence of molecular oxygen. Among the analyzed derivatives, 2,9&#8208;dinitro&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DNDBQA) was the one with the highest excited state reduction potential (Ered*=1.60&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), while N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) showed valuable excited state redox potentials (Ered*=1.29&#8197;V; Eox*=&#8722;1.28&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), making it suitable for bimodal applications in oxidative and reductive photocatalytic processes. Afterwards, the synthetized QA derivatives were examined as photocatalysts to promote the selective aerobic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide. Promising results in thioanisole oxidation were achieved with all the QA derivatives tested as photocatalysts, in terms of yield and selectivity. Remarkably, DBQA showed the best performances, catalyzing the reaction in only 20 minutes, using 0.5&#8201;% of the photocatalyst, and showing excellent performances in the oxidation of several thioether derivatives.

A visible&#8208;light induced radical 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylallyl alcohols was developed toward &#946;&#8208;polochloromethylated ketones with commercially available CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 as tri&#8208; and dichloromethyl radical precursors.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced radical 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylallyl alcohols was developed under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Commercially available CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 were used as tri&#8208; and dichloromethyl radical precursors. Structurally diverse &#946;&#8208;polochloromethylated ketones were obtained in good to moderate yields via neophyl&#8208;type rearrangement. Besides, the polychloromethyl group can be easily transformed into other useful functional groups.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bond Bearing Organic Frameworks by Advanced Heterogeneous Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review reports metal containing heterogeneous catalytic systems for the transformations of aromatic amines to azo compounds hydrazines and 2H&#8208;indzoles.







Abstract
The most significant task in synthetic organic chemistry is developing organic reactions from a green and sustainable perspective. In these ways, heterogeneous catalysts are essential in many organic reactions. Thus, this study focuses on the synthesis of N&#8722;N bond bearing organic frameworks, particularly aromatic azo compounds and indazoles, using a heterogeneous metal catalyst. Organic molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bonds are greatly sought after in the synthesis of dyes, photochemical switches, food additives, and bioactive chemicals due to industry and human requirements. Finally, this review provides an overview of synthetic routes for the formation of N&#8722;N bonds by using various heterogeneous metal catalytic systems.

         <title>An Improved Procedure for Aryne Generation from o&#8208;Triazenylarylboronic Acids through One&#8208;Pot Boronate Formation/Silica Gel Treatment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The procedure for generating arynes from o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids was improved. Our recent procedure required to use excess aryne precursors to arynophiles, but the new one&#8208;pot procedure, which involves boronate formation and silica gel treatment, allows for high&#8208;yielding transformations using the precursors as limiting reagents. This procedure is particularly useful for generating complex arynes from elaborated precursors.







Abstract
We have developed an improved method for generating aryne from o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids. Unlike the previous method that required excess o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids as aryne precursors, we used corresponding boronates as limiting reagents, which resulted in high yields. By combining the formation of boronates and aryne generation through silica gel treatment in one&#8208;pot, we were able to effectively use a wide range of o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids in reactions with various arynophiles. This one&#8208;pot method was particularly suitable for transforming complex aryne precursors with different functional groups.

Our recent procedure required to use excess aryne precursors to arynophiles, but the new one-pot procedure, which involves boronate formation and silica gel treatment, allows for high-yielding transformations using the precursors as limiting reagents. This procedure is particularly useful for generating complex arynes from elaborated precursors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed an improved method for generating aryne from &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-triazenylarylboronic acids. Unlike the previous method that required excess &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-triazenylarylboronic acids as aryne precursors, we used corresponding boronates as limiting reagents, which resulted in high yields. By combining the formation of boronates and aryne generation through silica gel treatment in one-pot, we were able to effectively use a wide range of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-triazenylarylboronic acids in reactions with various arynophiles. This one-pot method was particularly suitable for transforming complex aryne precursors with different functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;Alkenylation of Isoquinolones with Maleimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective olefination of N&#8208;protected isoquinolones at C8&#8208;position has been achieved under rhodium catalysis. A range of maleimides were employed to obtain the olefinated products in moderate to excellent yield with excellent selectivity. Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) study and Hammett plot analysis were also performed to understand the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;protected isoquinolone with maleimides is reported. The carbonyl group of isoquinolone acts as an inherent directing group. Various N&#8208;substituents in the maleimide, including alkyl, aryl, and even H and &#8722;OH, were well tolerated under the developed reaction condition. This protocol showed broad substrate scope, good selectivity, and excellent yields. Hammett plot is also drawn to check the effect of substituents on the reaction progress.

         <title>Amidyl Radical Directed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization with Silyl Enol Ethers via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic site&#8208;selective functionalization of hydroxamic acid derivatives was described. This transformation was achieved through amidyl radical directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer and intermolecular radical addition. Besides, this protocol proceeds under mild reaction conditions with high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein we reported an efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxamides with silyl enol ethers as radical acceptors. The reaction proceeded through amidyl radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation via radical addition of silyl enol ethers. The process features mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, allowing the preparation of a series of carboxamides with pendant carbonyl moieties.

A photocatalytic perfluoroalkylation/cyclization cascade of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with perfluoroalkyl halides leading to polysubstituted 1,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;induced perfluoroalkylative cyclization of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes leading to pentasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;ones is presented. The reaction is regiospecific, for the radical adds across the acrylamido moiety, whereas the enaminic double bond functions as a built&#8208;in radical trap. It could be carried out on a 2&#8208;gram scale, and the sunlight is a usable light source. Other virtues of the protocol include a short reaction time, a low catalyst loading, mild conditions and a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Influence of Substitution on the Supramolecular Chemistry of Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a detailed host&#8208;guest study of [10]cycloparaphenylene and three substituted analogues with the fullerenes C60 and C70 is presented. Fluorescence quenching experiments as well as computational chemistry were employed in order to shine light on the influence of substitution on the association behavior. An increased steric demand was facing additional attractive interactions between substituents and the fullerene itself.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive host&#8208;guest study of four substituted and unsubstituted [10]cycloparaphenylenes with the fullerenes C60 and C70. Within this study, the influence on the complexation behavior was investigated experimentally and computationally. Due to the increased steric demand the substitution on the nanohoop results in an energetic penalty, which could be partially compensated by additional substituent&#8208;fullerene interactions. These attractive interactions are intensified in the C70 complexes and with an increased degree of substitution. For the computational investigation conformer ensembles were taken into account, providing reliable structures with Boltzmann weighted energies. An analysis of the noncovalent interactions elucidated the origin of the enhanced substituent&#8208;C70 interaction. The ellipsoid fullerene C70 can be considered as a &#960;&#8208;extended version of C60, which is able to increase the attractive van der Waals interactions within these supramolecular complexes.

An increased steric demand was facing additional attractive interactions between substituents and the fullerene itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a comprehensive host-guest study of four substituted and unsubstituted [10]cycloparaphenylenes with the fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;. Within this study, the influence on the complexation behavior was investigated experimentally and computationally. Due to the increased steric demand the substitution on the nanohoop results in an energetic penalty, which could be partially compensated by additional substituent-fullerene interactions. These attractive interactions are intensified in the C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; complexes and with an increased degree of substitution. For the computational investigation conformer ensembles were taken into account, providing reliable structures with Boltzmann weighted energies. An analysis of the noncovalent interactions elucidated the origin of the enhanced substituent-C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; interaction. The ellipsoid fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; can be considered as a &#960;-extended version of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, which is able to increase the attractive van der Waals interactions within these supramolecular complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We described here a simple and metal&#8208;free protocol to synthesize [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides through a two&#8208;step synthetic strategy, in which the first step uses organocatalysis (10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of diethylamine or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, while the second step involves the use of inorganic base (1.2 or 0.1&#8197;equiv. of potassium hydroxide). These reactions were performed between &#946;&#8208;keto amides and o&#8208;carbonyl phenylazides in dimethylsulfoxide as solvent at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The synthetic protocol is ample, which thirteen examples of secondary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides were synthesized ranging from good to excellent yields (63&#8208;96&#8201;%), and six different tertiary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines 3&#8208;carboxamides were obtained ranging from moderate to good yields (48&#8211;76&#8201;%).

         <title>Kinetic and Product Study of the S&#8208;oxidation vs HAT Chemoselectivity in Reactions Promoted by Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;oxo Complex/NHPI Mediator System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidations of aryl sulfides, alkylaromatics and benzylic alcohols promoted by the nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ either alone or in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediator indicate a general preference for the S&#8208;oxidation in the absence of the mediator while hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is favored in the reactions promoted by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radical deriving from NHPI oxidation by [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+.







Abstract
The chemoselectivity between S&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from C&#8722;H bonds has been investigated in the oxidations of a series of aryl sulfides, alkyl aromatic compounds and benzylic alcohols promoted by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ (N4Py: N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;methylamine) either alone or in the presence of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediator via kinetic and product studies. Kinetic analyses indicate a generally higher reactivity of [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ for S&#8208;oxidation process while HAT is favored in the reactions promoted by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radical (PINO) deriving from NHPI oxidation. Product analysis in intermolecular competitive oxidations confirms the kinetic results with sulfoxides obtained as major products in the oxidation promoted by [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+. Conversely, when NHPI is employed as a mediator, significant differences in terms of chemoselectivity are observed, and HAT&#8208;derived products are obtained in higher yields which translate into an inversion of selectivity in the case of the substrates containing activated C&#8722;H bonds like diphenylmethane, triphenylmethane and benzylic alcohols. A similar change of chemoselectivity is also observed in the oxidation of aromatic substrates containing both a sulfur atom and &#945; to OH benzylic C&#8722;H bonds, with the sulfoxide product more abundant in the absence of NHPI and carbonyl products prevailing with the [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+/NHPI system.

         <title>Activation of N&#8722;O &#963; Bonds with Transition Metals: A Versatile Platform for Organic Synthesis and C&#8722;N Bonds Formation
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the versatile reactivity of transition metal catalysts toward N&#8722;O &#963; bonds. Emphasis is made on the mechanistic pathways and their experimental and computational proofs in the described transformations.







Abstract
N&#8722;O &#963; bonds containing compounds are versatile substrates for organic synthesis under transition metal catalysis. Their ability to react through both polar (oxidative addition, formation of metallanitrene, nucleophilic substitution) and radical pathways (single electron transfer, homolytic bond scission) have triggered the development of various synthetic methodologies, particularly toward synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In this review, we discuss the different modes of activation of N&#8722;O bonds in the presence of transition metal catalysts, emphasizing the experimental and computational mechanistic proofs in the literature to help to design new synthetic pathways toward the synthesis of C&#8722;N bonds.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free and NBS&#8208;Mediated Direct Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange Reaction to Access Unsymmetrical Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel NBS&#8208;mediated direct thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction has been described for the construction of various unsymmetrical disulfides at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions. More than 30&#8197;examples of unsymmetrical disulfides were isolated in good yields (up to 93&#8201;%). Captopril, an angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme inhibitor, was able to form the corresponding unsymmetrical disulfide in 61&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free and N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS)&#8208;mediated direct thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction at room temperature is developed. A variety of unsymmetrical disulfides have been prepared with good to excellent yields. Efficient late&#8208;stage modification of amino acids and drugs demonstrates the utility of this strategy. In addition, easy to operate, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance further demonstrate that this reaction provides an essential complementary route to access unsymmetrical disulfides.

         <title>CO2 Hydroboration: Impact of the Boryl Moieties on the Reactivity of Four Bis(boryl)acetal Compounds toward 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylaniline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four bis(boryl)acetal compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were synthesized under identical conditions. Mechanistic investigations proved that their condensation toward 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline is very sensitive to the steric hindrance of the boryl moieties.







Abstract
The hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) compounds is an important transformation, since it enabled to selectively reduce CO2 by 4e&#8208; and to subsequently use the BBA compounds as C1 and Cn sources. However, the influence of the nature of the boryl moieties on the reactivity of BBA compounds has not been evaluated so far. In the present study, four BBA compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were reacted with 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline to afford the expected imine. Significant differences in the rate of the reaction from minutes to weeks have been observed depending on the BBA used, showing the importance of the nature of the boryl moieties.

     alt="CO2 Hydroboration: Impact of the Boryl Moieties on the Reactivity of Four Bis(boryl)acetal Compounds toward 2,6-Diisopropylaniline"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four bis(boryl)acetal compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were synthesized under identical conditions. Mechanistic investigations proved that their condensation toward 2,6-diisopropylaniline is very sensitive to the steric hindrance of the boryl moieties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydroboration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) compounds is an important transformation, since it enabled to selectively reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 4e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to subsequently use the BBA compounds as C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sources. However, the influence of the nature of the boryl moieties on the reactivity of BBA compounds has not been evaluated so far. In the present study, four BBA compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were reacted with 2,6-diisopropylaniline to afford the expected imine. Significant differences in the rate of the reaction from minutes to weeks have been observed depending on the BBA used, showing the importance of the nature of the boryl moieties. Theoretical investigations enabled to propose a mechanism involving the addition of the aniline to the BBA as the rate-determining step and to determine that the steric hindrance of the BBA compounds is the main factor driving the rate of this condensation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Halogen Atom Transfer to Access Polyhalogenated and Deuterated Lactams from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy for the synthesis of polyhalogenated and deuterated &#948;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;lactams from readily available alkyl halides has been developed. The reaction utilizes halogen atom transfer to generate a variety of fluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and deuterated haloalkyl radicals that initiate a cascade addition&#8208;cyclization process with N&#8208;allyl benzamides to afford 5&#8208;membered and 6&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
A visible light mediated protocol for the synthesis of polyhalogenated and deuterated &#948;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;lactams from readily available alkyl halides is reported. The reaction involves the generation of haloalkyl radicals through halogen atom transfer (XAT) and subsequent arylalkylation of olefins to afford dihydroisoquinolinones and oxindoles. This new XAT protocol exhibits wide scope under mild conditions and enables access to new halogenated chemical space.

         <title>C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Thiols Mediated by Gold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold mediated C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling of aryldiazonium salts with thiols is described. The relevance of the protocol is the use of the readily available and simple gold complex Me2SAuCl. The reaction proceeds under soft conditions and has a broad scope in both the diazonium salt and the thiol.







Abstract
In this work, the coupling of aryldiazonium salts with thiols mediated by the readily accessible gold complex Me2SAuCl is described. In the reported protocol, the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a ligand leads to higher yields than phosphines. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under soft mildconditions and has a broad scope in both the aryldiazonium salt and the thiol. Notably, the coupling works with aryldiazonium salts containing two additional substituents.

         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, N, O, bidentate directing group assisted C&#8722;H bond functionalization of benzamides with maleimides was developed for the facile access to isoindolone spirosuccinimides in good to excellent yields. This C&#8722;H bond activation and spirocyclization employing pyridine N&#8208;oxide as directing group provided very good substrate scope and well tolerated various functional groups. Furthermore, the mechanistic investigation revealed that C&#8208;H bond activation is the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction.</dc:description>

(Cyclo)alkyl Pyridine: A systematic study on the SNAr arylation of nitrile and ester anions with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;flurropyridine derivatives is described. In combination with hydrolysis and decarboxylation, the method provides an efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of functionalized pyridines decorated with alkyl, cycloalkyl, and saturated heterocyclic substituents at the &#945; or &#947; positions &#8211; valuable building blocks for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic study on the SnAr reaction of halogenated fluoropyridines and (hetero)aliphatic nitrile anions as an approach to the synthesis of functionalized pyridines bearing a (cyclo)alkyl or saturated heterocyclic substituent by is described. The scope of the method was demonstrated on a wide range of (hetero)aliphatic nitriles (including three&#8208; to six&#8208;membered cycloalkane derivatives and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles) and all isomeric halogenated 2&#8208;and 4&#8208;fluoropyridines. High chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity (i.&#8201;e., exclusive substitution of the fluorine atom), as well as excellent scalability of the proposed reaction sequence were demonstrated (up to 450&#8197;g for the arylation step or up to 77&#8197;g of cycloalkylpyridine over two steps in a single run). The utility of the synthesized products was illustrated in the additional functional group transformations resulting in synthetically valuable pyridine&#8208;containing building blocks.

         <title>Construction of &#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine Derivatives through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed, C(sp2)&#8722;H (ortho) Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Phenylalanines (&#946;&#8208;amino acids) were subjected to Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed, picolinamide&#8208;aided ortho C&#8722;H functionalization including arylation, halogenation, and methoxylation. Construction of a library of biaryl&#8208;or terphenyl&#8208;type &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine and ortho C&#8722;H halogenated&#8208;, methoxylated &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines is reported. The expansion of substrate scope in site&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H (ortho) functionalization and synthesis of unnatural &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines and peptides are shown.







Abstract
This paper describes the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed, picolinamide&#8208;directing&#8208;group&#8208;aided C(sp2)&#8722;H (ortho) functionalization of racemic and enantiopure &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropanols (1,3&#8208;amino alcohols). The C(sp2)&#8722;H (ortho) functionalizations including arylation, bromination, iodination, and alkoxylation were attempted. The C(sp2)&#8722;H (ortho) arylation reactions gave biaryl or terphenyl&#8208;type &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine scaffolds, halogenation and methoxylation reactions gave ortho C&#8722;H halogenated or methoxylated &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines. Additionally, the C&#8722;H arylation of an ortho&#8208;methyl substituted &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine containing both C(sp2)&#8722;H and remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds was investigated. &#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine is an arylated &#946;&#8208;amino acid motif present in various natural products, bioactive molecules, and &#946;&#8208;peptides and it is a precursor to medicinally active compounds. Accordingly, this work contributes to the expansion of the library of unnatural &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine (&#946;&#8208;amino acid) derivatives through site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Substitution of Alcohols in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent developments in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct substitution of alcohols in aqueous media.







Abstract
The direct use of alcohols as the much greener and more sustainable alkylated reagents in substitution reactions is one of the emerging areas in green chemisty. However, owing to the poor leaving character of OH group, the direct substitution of alcohols is not an easy thing. Transition metal (TM) catalysis such as Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic/benzyl substitution and Ir&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen provides efficient protocols for the direct substitution of alcohols, however, an organic solvent and servely anhydrous conditions are generally required. In recent decade, TM&#8208;catalyzed direct substitution of alcohols in aqueous media was developed as a much greener alternative. In this review, the recent develpoments of this area are summarized. The activation mechanism of alcohols in aqueous reactions are emphatically discussed.

         <title>4,6&#8208;Dihydroxysalicylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Olefination of Methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes with Benzyl Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative olefination of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes with benzylamines for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaryl stilbenoids is reported, where the commercially available organocatalyst 4,6&#8208;dihydroxysalicylic acid with only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading and oxygen (1&#8197;atm) as the sole oxidant is used without needing transition metal salts, ligands, stoichiometric base, acid, or oxidant.







Abstract
Benzyl amines were deaminated for the olefination of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes such as quinolines, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines catalyzed by 4,6&#8208;dihydroxysalicylic acid with only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. A wide range of N&#8208;heteroaryl stilbenoids were synthesized in yields of 42 to 96&#8201;% using oxygen (1&#8197;atm) as the sole oxidant. 4,6&#8208;dihydroxysalicylic acid not only behaves as an organocatalyst for the oxidation of benzyl amines to the imine intermediates, but also provides an acidic reaction condition for the olefinations. Gram scale reaction and the synthesis of two pharmaceutically relevant conjugated olefins were also successful using this methodology.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study highlights the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from simple and readily available aromatic methyl ketones. Starting from acetophenone derivatives the straight&#8208;forward synthesis strategy involved an initial bromination of the alpha&#8208;positioned methyl group in the first step, followed by a simple hydrolysis to the hydroxyketone (2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone). The hydroxylated intermediate was subsequently converted using the transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi to to the final 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol; in this case phenylglycinol derivatives. The transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction step proceeded with yields of up to 62% and always excellent enantiomeric excess of &gt;99%. Interestingly, the keto enol tautomerism of the hydroxyl ketone yields an unexpected amino alcohol isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridine and Quinoline Scaffolds by Using Organometallic Li&#8208;, Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208;Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different approaches to functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds are covered in this review, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Sensitive maybe broad functional group tolerance, moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, and inexpensive and low&#8208;hazardous chemicals were used to highly functionalize pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive pharmaceutical scaffolds and natural products.







Abstract
This Review discusses the various methods for functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Selective deprotonation of aryl or pyridyl/quinolinyl derivatives can be performed using n&#8208;BuLi, LDA, and TMP&#8208;based different organolithium, &#8208;magnesium, and &#8208;zinc reagents. The functionalized pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based heterocyclic compounds were prepared by selectively deprotonating with presenting a directing functional group substituted pyridine/quinoline analogues in the presence of TMP&#8208;bases (TMP&#8722;Li, Mg, Zn reagents). Different aryl or alkyl Li, Mg, and Zn reagents with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions with pyridine/quinoline halides under mild conditions with the sustainable process producing complex N&#8208;heterocycles. Using moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, sensitive functional group tolerance, and inexpensive and low toxic chemicals, highly functionalization of pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive therapeutic scaffolds and natural products was accomplished. Therefore, in this article, we provide a succinct overview of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods used by various authors between 2010 and 2023 to functionalize pyridine and quinoline analogues using diverse Li, Mg, and Zn organometallic reagents.

         <title>Construction of Difluoroalkylated Cyclopentenones through Photocatalytic Difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo Cyclization Cascades of Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo cyclization cascades of ynones is developed, providing facile access to synthetically important difluoroalkylated cyclopentenones in promising yields. It represents the first example of alkyldifluoroalkylation of alkynes.







Abstract
Difluoroalkyl groups and cyclopentenones are both important units in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The difuoroalkylation coupled with a cyclopentenone formation still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cascade difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo cyclization of ynones with difluoroalkyl bromides to access difluoroalkylated cyclopentenones, which may find wide applications for the concise synthesis of fluorinated cyclic molecules.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Reduction of Phosphine Oxides through Electrophilic Activation of the P=O Bond with Anhydride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective reduction of phosphine oxides under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and alkaline conditions with the use of TFAA/NaH was developed. This reaction provides an efficient method for converting phosphine oxides into phosphines. It is deduced that P=O bond was firstly electrophilically activated by TFAA forming a phosphonium salt R3P(OOCCF3)2, and subsequently reduced by NaH, which was strengthened by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5.







Abstract
A highly chemoselective reduction of phosphine oxides was demonstrated under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and alkaline reaction conditions. During the reaction, P=O bond was firstly electrophilically activated by an anhydride and subsequently reduced by the versatile and cheap NaH, which was strengthened by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5. By this strategy, a variety of phosphine oxides including those bearing functional groups such as methyl, methoxyl, phenyl, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, alkenyl, alkynyl and heterocycles were transformed readily into the corresponding phosphines in good to high yields. This work represents an efficient method for reducing phosphine oxides forming phosphines.

         <title>Photochemical Bromination of 2,5&#8208;Dimethylbenzoic Acid as Key Step of an Improved Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Blue Box Synthesis
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized blue box has been revised. Overcoming the limits of the existing synthesis for every single step, the overall yield was increased five times. Importantly, photochemical bromination was adopted to obtain a key intermediate. The target compound was functionalized by using click&#8208;chemistry, and it was confirmed by electrochemical techniques that it retains the ability to engage in radical&#8208;radical interactions.







Abstract
Cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene), also known as &#8220;blue box&#8221;, is a highly electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle, widely used as a molecular receptor for small electron&#8208;rich molecules. Inserting a reactive functional group onto the molecular structure of this cyclophane is paramount for its inclusion into complex architectures. To this aim, including an alkyne moiety would be ideal, because it can participate in click reactions. However, the synthesis of such alkyne&#8208;functionalized cyclophane suffers from several drawbacks: the use of toxic and expensive CCl4, the need for high&#8208;pressure reactors, and overall low yield. We have revised the existing synthesis of this cyclophane derivative bearing an alkyne moiety, to overcome all these limitations. In particular, photochemical radical bromination is adopted to obtain a sensitive intermediate. We demonstrated that the synthesized host molecule can be functionalized via click reactions and take part in radical&#8208;radical interactions. Our work makes a key functionalized paraquat macrocycle more accessible, facilitating the development of novel redox&#8208;responsive systems.
