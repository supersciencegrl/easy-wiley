         <title>Sustainable Cascades to Difluoroalkylated Polycyclic Imidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4485-4489, August 20, 2021. </description>

A sustainable cascade synthesis of imidazoles from alkenes is described here. Series of highly functionalized polycyclic imidazoles were prepared efficiently with 0.01&#8197;equiv. of fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as photocatalyst under the irradiation of 3&#8197;W blue LEDs. This method is characterized by a wide substrate scope with up to 95&#8201;% isolated yield under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicated a photocatalyzed direct radical difluoroalkylated cyclization of imidazoles with alkenes.







Abstract
We reported herein a visible light promoted difluoroalkylated cascade of imidazoles and alkenes to afford highly functionalized polycyclic imidazoles. This method features a direct radical cyclization of imidazoles with alkenes using BrCF2R as radical sources. The reaction conditions tolerate a wide range of substrate scope and afford the desired products with up to 95&#8201;% isolated yield under mild conditions. Radical&#8208;trapping and light&#8208;on/off experiments indicated a photocatalytic radical mechanism.

Calix[4]arene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene molecular tweezers modified on the lower rim were synthesized using an Ullman coupling&#8211;click reaction sequence.







Abstract
An approach for the lower rim modification of the calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular tweezes with monopyrrolo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) arms attached to the upper rim of calixarenes is described. First, calixarene&#8208;MPTTF conjugates with free hydroxyl on the lower rim are synthesized using the Ullmann reaction, then hydroxyl groups are substituted by propargyl groups, which can be used for further modification by the click reaction. The new calixarene&#8208;TTF derivatives displayed reversible redox processes, as well as demonstrated binding affinity for electron&#8208;deficient molecular guests such as tetracyanoquinodimethane. The described synthetic approach will be used for the modular synthesis of molecular receptors tailored for specific applications.

A facile, eco&#8208;friendly, efficient, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by immobilizing copper impregnated on the mesoporous magnetic nanoparticles. The synthesized Fe3O4&#8722;CuO NCs is applied as a magnetically retrievable heterogeneous catalyst for the N&#8208;formylation of wide range of amines using formic acid as a formylating agent at room temperature.







Abstract
A facile, eco&#8208;friendly, efficient, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by immobilizing copper impregnated on mesoporous magnetic nanoparticles. The surface chemistry analysis of Fe3O4&#8722;CuO nanocomposites (NCs) by XRD and XPS demonstrates the synergistic effect between Fe3O4 and CuO nanoparticles, providing mass&#8208;transfer channels for the catalytic reaction. TEM images clearly indicate the impregnation of CuO onto mesoporous Fe3O4. This hydrothermally synthesized eco&#8208;friendly and highly efficient Fe3O4&#8722;CuO NCs are applied as a magnetically retrievable heterogeneous catalyst for the N&#8208;formylation of wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, polyaromatic and heteroaromatic amines using formic acid as a formylating agent at room temperature. The catalytic activity of the NCs for N&#8208;formylation is attributable to the synergistic effect between Fe3O4 and CuO nanoparticles. The N&#8208;formylated product is further employed for the synthesis of biologically active quinolone moieties.

         <title>Using a Johnson&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement Strategy to Construct Azaindoles &#8211; A Streamlined and Concise Route for the Commercial Process of Fevipiprant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4490-4494, August 20, 2021. </description>

A novel and concise synthesis of the DP2 receptor antagonist Fevipiprant (NVP&#8208;QAW039) was developed. The key step &#8211; a Johnson Claisen reaction followed by an intramolecular hydroamination of the formed reactive allene moiety allowed to build the 7&#8208;aza&#8208;indole framework, while overcoming the low selectivity and low yield of the initial research route, and give access to a commercially viable process with a reduced ecological footprint.







Abstract
A novel and concise synthesis of the DP2 receptor antagonist Fevipiprant (NVP&#8208;QAW039) was developed. The initial research route was suffering from a long reaction sequence to the functionalized 7&#8208;aza&#8208;indole core followed by a poorly selective N(1)&#8208;alkylation with the benzyl side chain. These limitations were overcome by introducing the side chain early by reductive amination between the functionalized aldehyde and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine. The Sonogashira coupling with prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol introduces the 3 missing carbon atoms to build the 7&#8208;aza&#8208;indole core and sets the stage for the innovative Johnson&#8208;Claisen key step. The reaction of the advanced propargylic alcohol derivative with trimethyl orthoacetate led to a reactive allene intermediate which spontaneously and selectively cyclizes to the 7&#8208;aza&#8208;indole QAW039&#8208;methyl ester. QAW039 was isolated after ester saponification. Selectivity, yield, and ecological footprint of the new synthesis were significantly improved, and scalability was demonstrated.

         <title>Critical ligand and salt effects in organomagnesiate&#8208;promoted 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides synthesis from 2&#8208;iodobenzoate derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalides, also called isobenzofuranones, are widespread in many biologically active compounds and natural products.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phthalides, also called isobenzofuranones, are widespread in many biologically active compounds and natural products. To date, most of their synthetic routes are non-convergent. Herein we report a convergent route using a metal halogen exchange (MHE) strategy. Indeed MHE of easily available 2-iodobenzoate derivatives, using the bimetallic organomagnesiate complex (rac)-(BIPHEN)BuMgLi, where (rac)-BIPHEN is (rac)-5,5',6,6'-tetramethyl-3,3'-di- t -butyl-1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'-diol, followed by addition of a ketone which lead to an intramolecular cyclisation, and the formation of a series of diverse 3,3-disubstituted isobenzofuranones in good yield. Among the several MHE agents investigated, (rac)-(BIPHEN)BuMgLi was the only one to make such a process possible with full tolerance of various reactive functional substituents useful for subsequent transformations. The synthetic pathway to access the magnesiate has been found to play a prominent role in its reactivity. Therefore, the bimetallic magnesiate complex has been characterized by solution-state 1H, 7Li and 1H DOSY NMR experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Practical One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1,3&#8208;Benzoxazines Using Copper, Hydrogen Peroxide and Triethylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we describe simple one&#8208;pot syntheses of 2H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzoxazines from ketones utilizing an imino&#8208;pyridine directing group (R1R2&#8208;C=N&#8208;CH2&#8208;Pyr), which promotes a Cu&#8208;directed sp2 hydroxylation using H2O2 as oxidant and followed by an oxidative intramolecular C&#8208;O bond formation upon addition of NEt3. This synthetic protocol is utilized in the gram scale synthesis of the 2H1,3&#8208;benzoxazine derived from benzophenone. Mechanistic studies reveal that the cyclization occurs via deprotonation of the benzylic position of the directing group to produce a 2&#8208;azallyl anion intermediate, which is oxidized to the corresponding 2&#8208;azaallyl radical before the C&#8208;O bond formation event. Understanding of the cyclization mechanism also allowed us to develop reaction conditions that utilize catalytic amounts of Cu.</dc:description>

The Front Cover was inspired by the painting on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, made by Michelangelo. Here we represent the creation of new resveratrol derivatives via galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell. An environmentally benign procedure was developed for the electrochemical oxidative mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenylation of the C(sp2)&#8208;H bond, under oxidant&#8208;, base&#8208;, and transition metal&#8208;free conditions, in an open system at room temperature.

The work describes an electrochemical oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H selenylation of resveratrol. Driven by galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell, it provided efficient transformation in an open system at room temperature. Using this benign, atom&#8208;economic protocol, the desired selenylated products were obtained regioselectively, in good to excellent yields by using half molar equiv. of the diselenides.







Abstract
A simple and environmentally benign procedure for electrochemical oxidative mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenylation of the resveratrol C(sp2)&#8722;H bond was developed. Driven by galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell, it provided efficient transformation under oxidant&#8208;, base&#8208;, and transition metal&#8208;free conditions, in an open system at room temperature. With satisfactory functional group compatibility, it required a substoichiometric amount of NaI, which acted as an electrolyte and mediator.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Calix[4]pyrrole: From the Formation to the Synthesis of Calix[4]pyrrolidine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4444-4464, August 20, 2021. </description>

Calix[4]pyrrolidine, is a topological analogue of the chromophore of the pigments of life. An efficient two&#8208;step procedure, starting with the condensation between acetone and pyrrole followed by a heterogenous catalytic hydrogenation, has been developed. Many unsuspected aspects demonstrating the influence of the topology on the physicochemical and chemical properties emerged. The simple, symmetric structure showed unique attributes.







Abstract
Calix[4]pyrroles can be obtained from the efficient preprogrammed condensation between acetone and pyrrole. This reaction forms the attractive macrocycle resembling in its constitution, but not in its oxidation state, to the porphyrin structure, prominently present in the vital &#8220;pigments of life&#8221;. Calix[2]pyrrolidine[2]pyrrole and calix[4]pyrrolidine, the partially and totally reduced version of the macrocycle, became accessible through the hydrogenation of calix[4]pyrrole, but only under strenuous reaction conditions. The only known hydrogenation, which could give clues for improving the process, was the reduction of the calix[4]furan. To shed light on the process, mixed calix[n]furan[4&#8208;n]pyrroles were prepared, and their hydrogenation was studied. After a laborious optimization process, the best conditions were discovered improving the yield of the hydrogenation process from the level of a formation to the level of a complete conversion. The calix[4]pyrrolidine is now accessible in two high yielding synthetic steps. The efforts to understand and to optimize the factors involved in the hydrogenation process of this perazamacrocycle are here reviewed.

         <title>Direct Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols Using an Immobilized Oxovanadium Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4417-4422, August 20, 2021. </description>

A mesoporous silica&#8208;supported oxovanadium catalyst enabled the direct substitution of benzyl and allyl alcohols with sulfur and carbon nucleophiles. The catalyst showed high chemoselectivity for alcohols in the presence of acid&#8208;labile functional groups and could be recycled more than seven times.







Abstract
Direct nucleophilic substitution of alcohols with thiols or carbon nucleophiles was achieved using a mesoporous silica&#8208;supported oxovanadium catalyst (VMPS4). Benzyl and allyl alcohols were compatible in this reaction under mild conditions, affording the products in high yields. The VMPS4 catalyst showed excellent chemoselectivity toward alcohols in the presence of acid&#8208;labile functional groups, which is in contrast to that observed for the commonly used Lewis acid catalysts, which exhibit poor selectivity. The VMPS4 catalyst could be recycled by simple centrifugation, and the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles.

         <title>Customizable and Regioselective One&#8208;Pot N&#8722;H Functionalization of DNA Nucleobases to Create a Library of Nucleobase Derivatives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4423-4433, August 20, 2021. </description>

One&#8208;pot synthetic procedures for producing a library of nucleobase derivatives enlisted with reactive functional groups for bioconjugation and cross&#8208;linking reactions with other biomolecules are reported. The nucleobase derivatives bearing either N&#8208;alkyl, N&#8208;propanenitrile, N&#8208;allyl or N&#8208;propargyl terminals are non&#8208;cytotoxic, denoting great promise for biomedical applications.







Abstract
DNA is one of the most exciting biomolecules in nature for developing supramolecular biofunctional nanoarchitectures owing to the highly specific and selective interactions between complementary Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. Herein, simple and one&#8208;pot synthetic procedures have been implemented for producing a library of DNA nucleobase derivatives endowed with reactive functional groups for bioconjugation and cross&#8208;linking strategies with other (bio)molecules. Purine and pyrimidine molecules have been regioselectively N&#8722;H functionalized either via N&#8208;alkylation, N&#8208;allylation, N&#8208;propargylation or Michael&#8208;type reactions and structurally characterized. The influence of the reaction conditions was assessed and discussed. The in&#8197;vitro biocompatibility of the native and nucleobase derivatives was evaluated by culturing them with human fibroblasts, revealing their cytocompatibility. The library of nucleobase derivatives holds great promise for being coupled to different biomolecules, including biopolymeric materials, lipids, and peptides, thus potentially leading to modular supramolecular nanobiomaterials for biomedicine.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Nitriles to Amines and Esters to Alcohols</title>

Here reports a base&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of nitriles to amines and esters to silylated alcohols. This protocol tolerates electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;neutral olefins and works in the presence of basic functional groups (e.&#8201;g. tertiary amines) but fails for acidic substrates, such as phenols and NH anilines.







Abstract
Base&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of nitriles to amines and esters to silylated alcohols is reported. This protocol tolerates electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;neutral olefins and works in the presence of basic functional groups (e.&#8201;g. tertiary amines) but fails for acidic substrates, such as phenols and NH anilines. This catalytic system does not tolerate carbonyl groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, esters and carbamides, which are reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines. With the exact amount of silane, esters can be selectively reduced in the presence of nitriles, but the selectivity drops for the pairs ester/carboxamide and carboxamide/nitrile. Through competition experiments, the following preference in functional group reactivity was determined: ester &gt; carboxamide &gt; nitrile.

         <title>Regioselective Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation in the Reaction of Ag(III) N&#8208;Confused Porphyrin Complex with HCl or HBr</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 31, Page 4440-4443, August 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent silver involved halogenation reactions are reported. When 3&#8208;ethoxy Ag(III) N&#8208;confused porphyrin was treated with dilute halogen acids (HCl or HBr), not only demetallation but also new carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation occurred. These halogenation reactions have been proposed to proceed via nucleophilic attack of halogen anion to the Ag(III) metal to generate high&#8208;valent Ag complex followed by reductive elimination. The importance of ethoxy group has been indicated by comparative experiments and crystallographic data.







Abstract
A facile inner halogenation of Ag(III) NCP complex 1 is reported. Treatment of 1 with 2N HCl and 1N HBr gave 2 and 4, respectively. A demetallized product 3 was formed as a trace side product when dilute acids were applied and as a predominant product when treated with concentrated acids. The importance of the C3&#8208;ethoxy group for the halogenation reactions was experimentally indicated. Treatment of 1 with 4N H2SO4 gave carbaporpholactam 6 in good yield. Halide anions are suggested to accelerate the demetallation reaction of 1.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfonyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Glycosyl N&#8208;sulfonyl amides have been synthesized by a self&#8208;promoted glycosylation, i.e. without any catalysts, promotors or additives. When the reactions were carried out at lower temperatures a mixture of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycosides were observed, where the latter rearranged to give the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides at elevated temperatures. By this method sulfonylated asparagine derivatives can be selectively &#946;&#8208;glycosylated in high yields by trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors of different reactivity including protected glucosamine derivatives. The chemoselectivity in the glycosylations as well as the rearrangements from O&#8208;glycosides to &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides gives information of the glycosylation mechanism. This method gives access to glycosyl sulfonyl amides under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;4&#8208;aminides was synthesized starting from thioamides and chloroacetonitrile  via  cyanomethylbenzimidothioates which were cyclized by benzoylchloride. Depending on the reaction conditions 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolium salts and 4&#8208;  N  &#8208;benzamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolium salts were obtained (X&#8208;ray structure analysis). Substitution of the amino groups with benzoylchlorides gave a series of the title mesoionic compounds (X&#8208;ray structure analysis) which were examined spectroscopically. Negative solvatochromism was found and temperature&#8208;dependent as well as time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements were made. Long lifetimes of the excited states (30 &#8208; 50 ns) were detected. Calculated frontier orbital profiles gain insight into the characteristics of 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;4&#8208;aminides as conjugated mesomeric betaines.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalysis meets hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalization: the role of N&#8208;hydroxyimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The merging of organocatalysis and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization has demonstrated to be a powerful approach towards the development of new efficient and selective synthetic protocols. Both research areas have witnessed a tremendous growth over the past two decades, with a high number of studies mainly reporting the use of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and related compounds in the selective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons. Additionally, heterogeneous NHPI&#8208;based systems can provide a green and sustainable perspective for oxidation reactions. Nevertheless, reports related to this latter approach are still scarce and need further scouting in terms of types of supports used. This short review accounts for relevant contributions from 2010 onwards on the use of NHPI&#8208;based systems for hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Allenes with Borane&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, reactions of unsaturated organic molecules with strong boron&#8208;based Lewis acids have attracted considerable attention. In this review, reactions of allenes with boron&#8208;based Lewis acids, especially such ones equipped with perfluorophenyl rings, are discussed. It is shown that depending on the substitution pattern of the allene and the borane, a surprisingly broad variety of chemical transformations can be observed. These transformations often include unexpected skeletal rearrangements of the former allene. Furthermore, some transformations require only catalytic amounts of the borane&#8208;based Lewis acid. Within this minireview, emphasis is given to the mechanistic aspects of these transformations, and similarities in the initial reaction steps are outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proline and 4&#8208;Hydroxyproline Based Approach to Enantiopure Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;Substituted Pyridine and Pyrimidine Derivatives</title>

The subsequent intramolecular cyclizations afforded enantiopure pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives with pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituents. The nonaflates generated from these intermediates were excellent precursors for typical palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Oxidation with  m  &#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid gave pyrrolidine  N  &#8208;oxides whose subsequent reactions were investigated. The condensation of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides with hydroxylamine hydrochloride furnished the corresponding enantiopure pyrimidine&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxides in good yields. The subsequent Boekelheide rearrangement provided hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivatives together with minor components. Overall, this study nicely demonstrates the potential of (  S  )&#8208;proline&#8208; or (2  S  ,4  R  )&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides to approach a library of novel chiral pool&#8208;derived enantiopure functionalized pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins through conjugate addition of organozinc reagents: An update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review focuses on the applications of organozinc reagents in conjugate addition reactions. Organozinc compounds are a class of organometallic reagent used in various reactions like addition, substitution and coupling reactions. The conjugate addition or 1, 4&#8208;addition is one of the most useful bond forming strategies used in organic synthesis since broad range of nucleophiles can be employed in the reaction. Addition of organozinc to electron&#8208;deficient olefins attracts synthetic chemists as it preferably undergoes conjugate addition over 1,2&#8208;addition unlike other organometallic reagents, such as Grignard reagent or organolithium. Many natural products were also synthesized by applying the conjugate addition reaction of organozinc. Moreover, organozinc reagents have superior functional group compatibility and can be easily prepared relative to other organometallic compounds. Consequently, conjugate additions of organozinc reagents were highly studied and having a review on it is very important at present. Though a few reviews are available, they are either not directly on the organozinc reagents or on the conjugate addition. We hope that this review article will be of great use to organic researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;promoted substitution in the ferrocene series: smooth approach towards original catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution is an important reaction in the ferrocene series, especially to reach ligands for catalysis. Here, we described new reactions conditions, using fluorinated alcohols as both solvent and promoter, able to deliver iodoferrocene derivatives faster than using classical solvents. Various  N  ,  O  ,  P  and  C  &#8208;nucleophiles were found compatible with this transformation which occurs with full retention of stereochemistry. Original P,N&#8208;ligands were finally prepared by using iodine/lithium exchange&#8208;chlorophoshine trapping sequences, and their properties were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling as well as in ketone &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile synthesis of diaminoxylosides via iodosulfonamidation of xylal derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>d  &#8208;Xylose is a special monosaccharide found in various organisms, which is characterized by conformational dynamics between different pyranose ring forms depending on the substitution pattern. With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4&#8208;bromophenyl 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;3&#8208;  O  &#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;xyloside from  l  &#8208;arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbiturils Monofunctionalized on the Methylene Bridge and their Host&#8208;Guest Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monofunctionalization of cucurbiturils is essential for the transfer of these potent supramolecular macrocyclic hosts into a real&#8208;world application. Here, we present the synthesis of cucurbit[6]urils  1  and  2  in which one methylene bridge is modified by a single substituent containing a nitro or ammonium group. We investigated the supramolecular host&#8208;guest properties in water and 0.2 M NaCl using  1  H NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry, particularly for  2  bearing ammonium substituent. The macrocycle  2  self&#8208;associated into dimeric aggregates in pure water, but readily disassembled in the presence of NaCl or organic cations. Cucurbit[7]uril was able to encapsulate the ammonium substituent of  2  inside its cavity resulting in a complex of 1:1 stoichiometry with an association constant of 3.1 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8208;1  . The presented host&#8208;guest properties together with further possible derivatization shows the potential of cucurbiturils modified in the methylene position such as  1  and  2  for the development of advanced supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work describes the preparation of halohydrins from 2&#8208;halocyclobutanones by means of reactions with Grignard reagents at &#8208;78 &#176;C. We discovered that the prepared cyclobutanols underwent a thermal ring&#8208;opening reaction. Depending on the structure of the starting cyclobutanol, different products were formed. More specifically, 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ol was found to open to &#947;&#8208;substituted butyrophenones. A novel 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative was obtained for indene&#8208;derived cyclobutanols. Based on the outcomes of the performed experiments, a mechanism for the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanols can be proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of diverse seleno&#8208;glycolipids via the transacetalization of selenoacetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seleno&#8208;glycolipids, in which glycosidic oxygens are replaced with selenium atoms, are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. However, the development of seleno&#8208;glycolipids has been hampered by difficulties associated with their chemical syntheses. In this study, we report the facile synthesis of novel seleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties, which proceeds  via  the transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work not only provides a route to monoseleno&#8208;glycolipids, but also demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Class of Natural Product Crispine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a small naturally occurring molecule, various optical isomers of chiral pyrrolo[2,1&#8208; a ]isoquinoline alkaloid crispine A represents a potential class of chiral molecules in contemporary organic chemistry, and possess diverse biological activities. The range of pharmacological activities include antidepressant, antiplatelet, antileukemic, and anticancer activities. This review provides an overview of the literature on the strategies, employed in the synthesis of crispine A in their racemic and enantiopure forms via Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization, Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization, N &#8208;Alkylation/Acylation&#8208;cyclization, Oxidative cyclization, and Asymmetric hydrogenation in the period of 1931&#8208;2021. This study accentuates the need for the developing more effective synthesis, and search for involved biological applications for the pyrroloisoquinoline class of natural product. Attention has been drawn towards the use of relatively less documented but easily accessible naturally occurring diastereomeric scaffolds namely, garcinia and hibiscus acids. These lactones obtained from (+)&#8208; and (&#8208;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxycitric acids bearing chemically amenable functional groups are investigated as an ideal choice for the enantiopure synthesis of the (&#8208;)&#8208;( R )&#8208; and (+)&#8208;( S )&#8208;Crispine A structural frame work.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of the Substituent and Amino Group Position on the Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Resolution of &#947;&#8208;Amino Esters: A Molecular Docking Study Shedding Light on CaLB Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic resolution of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl g&#8208;amino methyl esters bearing different stereocenters at alpha (&#947;2), beta (&#947;3), or gamma (&#947;4) positions was carried out by enantioselective hydrolysis with Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) in 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol solvent. The results show that the process is significantly less enantioselective for the &#947;2&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 2.5), the &#947;3&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 7.6), and the &#947;4&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 8.3) when compared with the kinetic resolution of analogous N&#8208;protected &#946;3&#8208;amino esters (E &gt; 80). Based on these results, molecular docking studies were carried out, through which particular regions in the CaLB catalytic cavity were analyzed. The steric exclusion region composed of Ile189 and Val190 residues, together with the amino bonding region that induces a hydrogen bond with the Asp134 residue, appear to be responsible for the high selectivity in the resolution of carboxylic acid derivatives with beta stereocenters. This interaction is well preserved for &#946;&#8208;amino esters as substrates. By contrast, &#947;&#8208;amino esters exhibit greater conformational diversity, so the effectiveness of the interaction is reduced, which apparently is responsible for the loss of enantioselectivity in the resolution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Applications of purine ring opening in the synthesis of imidazole, pyrimidine, and new purine derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purines, which are regarded as relatively stable heterocyclic systems, can be opened at both pyrimidine and imidazole rings. Purine ring opening also serves as a tool for the preparation of ring&#8208;modified purines via rearrangement/recyclization mechanisms. The obtained imidazole, pyrimidine, and purine derivatives are privileged molecular scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Purine ring&#8208;opening approach is a useful alternative for their synthesis, which competes well with  de novo  approach or modification of a conserved heterocyclic core. The substitution patterns and groups that activate purines towards ring opening are reviewed. Also, mechanistic studies using labelled substrates and leading to rearranged purine derivatives are covered. Furthermore, an insight of imidazole ring opening upon exposure of purine system to DNA damaging agents is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives and Polyureas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Trichloromethylative Olefin Cycloamination by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trichloromethyl group is an important functionality. It is a useful synthetic moiety and also appears in the structures of natural and biologically active compounds; hence, developing synthetic methods for its introduction into structural motifs is an important objective. Herein, we report efficient chemistry for the trichloromethylations and cycloaminations of olefin. These reactions are realized in a single step and triggered by the addition of the trichloromethyl radical, generated from bromotrichloromethane by photoredox catalysis, to a double bond, with the resulting intermediate trapped through intramolecular reaction with an amino group. This process facilitates the construction of  N&#8208;heterocycles having trichloromethyl units and tetrasubstituted carbons from simple compounds under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Fully Substituted 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. A final step diversification approach was employed to efficiently introduce various substituents in the 1&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions of the pyrazole. A scalable, multi&#8208;gram synthesis of the lead compound is also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. An efficient, divergent approach to introduce phenyl, phenoxy, phenylsulfanyl, anilino and benzyl substituents in the 4&#8208;position of the pyrazole, alongside a flexible synthesis of N1&#8208;alkyl analogues is described via final step diversification of key intermediates. Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenoxy)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]oxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.

The Cover Feature shows that the Relative Reactivity Value (RRV) is an effective stereoselectivity navigator for a sialylation reaction under the NIS/TfOH promotion system for the driver (chemist). The right turn and left turn signals are symbolizing the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sialosides, respectively, using donor RRV as a direction indicator. Thiosialoside donors having RRV &lt;11.5 enable selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;sialosides (right turn signal). On the other hand, donors with RRV &#8805;11.5 perform &#946;&#8208;selective sialylation reactions (left turn signal).

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Norbornadienes via in situ Cracking of Dicyclopentadiene using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The norbornadiene (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch has recently attracted attention due to its use in molecular solar thermal energy systems (MOST). Normally for device testing, several grams are needed. One way of synthesizing NBDs efficiently is through the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between alkynes and cyclopentadiene. However, scaling up the reaction can be troublesome in a research lab environment. Also, dicyclopentadiene needs cracking before utilization as a time&#8208;consuming step. Here, we developed a method where we both scale up the synthesis in a single reaction step that involves both  in situ  cracking of dicyclopentadiene and direct reaction of cyclopentadiene with acetylene derivatives using a tubular coiled stainless steel flow reactor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized 6 different NBD compounds, and scaled the synthesis to produce 87 g of a novel NBD in 9 h. The NBD is further characterized, showing promising properties for MOST applications. Our new method shows that flow chemistry is an attractive technique for the fast and efficient synthesis of large quantities of NBDs, needed to develop future real&#8208;life devices and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Lactams from Cyclic Anhydrides via N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic anhydrides can be readily converted to ring&#8208;contracted lactams after sequential silylazidation, protonolysis, Curtius rearrangement and catalysis of ring closure by DMAP, in an operationally simple procedure. Succinic anhydrides do not form ring&#8208;contracted &#946;&#8208;lactams but instead generate &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides which serve as activated analogues of &#946;&#8208;amino acids of use in &#946;&#8208;peptide and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
The ring contraction&#8208;lactamisation of anhydrides upon reaction with trimethylsilylazide in the presence of an amine catalyst has been studied. Under controlled conditions, 5,&#8208; 6&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered ring lactams can be generated from cyclic anhydrides in an operationally simple procedure. In the case of &#947;&#8208;lactams, the methodology allows for the synthesis of challenging systems incompatible with the usual disconnection involving an amine and an activated carbonyl group. The synthesis of simple larger ring lactams is hampered by inaccessible monomeric cyclic anhydride precursors &#8208; a problem which can be circumvented through rigidification. Succinic anhydrides make N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides of use in polymer chemistry and as &#946;&#8208;peptide precursors.

         <title>Base&#8208;free Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Click Cycloadditions (CuAAc) in Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents as Green and Catalytic Reaction Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The click cycloaddition of azides to alkynes affording 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is a widely used and effective chemical transformation, applied to obtain relevant products in medicine, biology and materials science. In this work, a set of Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADESs) has been investigated in the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAc) as green and catalytic reaction media. The use of these innovative solvents has been shown to improve the reaction effectiveness, giving excellent yields. NADESs proved to be &#8220;active&#8221; in their reducing capabilities in several cases and for the absence of added bases in all the performed reactions: DFT calculations demonstrated in fact the involvement of H&#8208;bonds between DESs and alkynes as well as stabilization of copper catalytic intermediates. The green experimental conditions, the absence of a base, the low temperatures, the lowering of reagents and the possibility of recycling of the solvents, outline the great potential of NADESs for CuAAc.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of imidazolinium salts via a catalytic dehydrogenation was developed using Pd/C as a catalyst with ammonium salt as an additive. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the existence of a proton source that was necessary to accomplish the reaction. Under the optimal conditions, oxidation&#8208;sensitive components such as an allyl, a furan, and a thiophene can be introduced into the corresponding imidazolinium salts. In addition to the varied  N  &#8208;substituents, the presented method can be used to synthesize a series of 2&#8208;substituted imidazolinium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Sialylation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative reactivity value was found to provide a guideline to control the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions under NIS/TfOH promotion system at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, resulting &#945;&#8208;selectivity &gt;75&#8201;% for &#945;(2&#8594;6)&#8208;linked disaccharides and &#946;&#8208;selectivity &gt;75&#8201;% for &#946;(2&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides.







Abstract
Although tremendous efforts have been made for the efficient preparation of sialosides, controlling the stereochemical outcome of sialylation reaction still remains one of the most challenging tasks due to the unique chemical structure of sialic acid. We developed a new strategy to statistically analyze the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions on six types of p&#8208;tolyl thiosialosides in NIS/TfOH system using Relative Reactivity Value (RRV) as the indicator. Analysis of the reaction mechanism showed the formation of the relatively stable glycosyl bromide and glycosyl chloride intermediates from halide&#8208; and triflate&#8208;containing promotors in the absence of an acceptor. We found that the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, yields, and intermediate changes were associated with their donor reactivity. These findings enable to tailor the most suitable building blocks for stereo&#8208;controlled sialylation reactions.

         <title>Compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms as carbohydrate receptors: syntheses and structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new representatives of compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms were prepared and their ability to act as carbohydrate receptors evaluated. The target compounds were obtained via multi&#8208;step syntheses, which included the preparation of numerous precursors as well as the isolation of a large number of by&#8208;products. The structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies comprise in particular the variation of the side&#8208;arms in order to demonstrate the importance of the presence of a hydrogen bond donor in these units for the effective complexation of carbohydrates. Based on the findings of our previous studies, the variation of the bridge units is limited to benzene&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;based moieties, whereby the use of the last&#8208;mentioned bridge type was expected to produce more effective systems. This assumption was confirmed by  1  H NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry.</dc:description>

         <title>[11C]HCN Radiochemistry: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a unique non&#8208;invasive imaging tool for studying the  in vivo  biological process. It utilizes short&#8208;lived positron emitter labeled organic molecules to study biological events in real&#8208;time. To incorporate the positron emitter into a molecule of biological interests, radioactive synthons are developed to facilitate radiolabeling chemistry. In addition to  11  C&#8208;methylation with [  11  C]CH  3  I/[  11  C]CH  3  OTf,  11  C&#8208;carbonylation with [  11  C]CO, and  11  C&#8208;carboxylation of organometallic reagents with [  11  C]CO  2  ,  11  C&#8208;cyanation with [  11  C]HCN and further transformation is another frequently used  11  C&#8208;labeling methodology that leads to the generation of [  11  C]organo&#8208;nitriles, [carbonyl&#8208;  11  C]carboxylic acids, [carbonyl&#8208;  11  C]aldehydes, [carbonyl&#8208;  11  C]amides, [  11  C]alkyl amines, [tetrazoyl&#8208;  11  C]tetrazoles,  and [  11  C]CN&#8208;containing heterocycles  , etc.  This review recognizes the important roles of  11  C&#8208;cyanation  reactions with the emphasis of recent advances of chemistry development along with the discussion of molar activity (A  m  ) of [  11  C]HCN based radiotracers, prompts for more potential [  11  C]cyanide based radiotracer development in the future perspectives.</dc:description>

In addition to  11  C-methylation with [  11  C]CH  3  I/[  11  C]CH  3  OTf,  11  C-carbonylation with [  11  C]CO, and  11  C-carboxylation of organometallic reagents with [  11  C]CO  2  ,  11  C-cyanation with [  11  C]HCN and further transformation is another frequently used  11  C-labeling methodology that leads to the generation of [  11  C]organo-nitriles, [carbonyl-  11  C]carboxylic acids, [carbonyl-  11  C]aldehydes, [carbonyl-  11  C]amides, [  11  C]alkyl amines, [tetrazoyl-  11  C]tetrazoles,  and [  11  C]CN-containing heterocycles  , etc.  This review recognizes the important roles of  11  C-cyanation  reactions with the emphasis of recent advances of chemistry development along with the discussion of molar activity (A  m  ) of [  11  C]HCN based radiotracers, prompts for more potential [  11  C]cyanide based radiotracer development in the future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combination of iron salts with magnesium alkoxides: an efficient strategy for stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling of Grignard reagents and conjugated dienyl bromides.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient procedure allowing iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl or aryl Grignard reagents and conjugated dienyl bromides is reported, relying on the use of cheap and non&#8208;toxic magnesium alkoxides as sole additives. An excellent stereoselectivity is observed in the alkyl&#8208;dienyl series. This sequence has been applied to the synthesis of the sex pheromone of codling moth, illustrating its applicability to the obtention of targets of industrial interest. Preliminary mechanistic studies carried out on the aryl&#8208;dienyl cross&#8208;coupling suggest that  in situ  generated  ate  homoleptic organoiron(II) species act as catalytically relevant intermediates. A modified preparative method for the realization of THF solutions of dienyl bromides as "ready&#8208;to&#8208;use" coupling partners is also discussed, circumventing the thermal instability of those derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) carry great potential in different fields of chemistry, based on their specific structures, their internal dynamics, their stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior and other unique features of the mechanical bond. This minireview presents some of the most recent developments in their use for medical and biological applications. For example, they have been used to influence, enhance or block the action of therapeutic agents to enable targeted drug delivery. The dynamic structural properties have been used to generate switches and transporters, as well as sensors for various medically relevant species. Building MIMs by incorporating biomolecules like DNA and proteins has served as a novel way to control their properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lactams by Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Derivatives with &#969;&#8208;Amino Fatty Acids under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented efficient method for the reductive amination of carbonyl derivatives with &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation conditions was developed leading to the corresponding lactams. A variety of pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, 2&#8208;azepanones were prepared in up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields (29 examples).







Abstract
An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2&#8208;azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance. Notably, no metallic based catalyst was required to perform this transformation.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines are accessible by a reaction sequence consisting of HWE&#8208;reaction, a Z/E&#8208;photoisomerization, and ring closure of the pyridine ring. Bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines can be obtained from 7&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the fused pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8211;Buchwald amination.

         <title>Aryl Fluoroalkyl Sulfoxides: Optical Stability and pKa Measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key properties of chiral aryl fluoroalkyl sulfoxides with strong synthetic potential were studied. After resolution by enantioselective chromatography, their optical stability was investigated by thermal enantiomerization via enantioselective chromatography. Their &#916;G&#8800; values range from 38.2 to 41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the pKa values of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined via indirect UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations in DMSO and are in the range of 20.3&#8211;22.5.







Abstract
The enantiomeric separation of aryl trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl sulfoxides was realized via chiral chromatography. The configurational stability of each set of enantiomers was then studied by thermal enantiomerization. The &#916;G&#8800; values obtained cover a range of 38.2&#8211;41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C, thus demonstrating their optical stability at room temperature. However, a shorter half&#8208;life time has been observed for difluoromethyl sulfoxides. Furthermore, the acidities of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined in DMSO by an overlapping indicator method using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations. The pKa values fall in range of 20.3&#8211;22.5 and differ by about 10&#8197;log units compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.

         <title>Isolation of a Cyclopentasilane from Magnesium Reduction of a Linear Hexasilane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive cyclization of two linear hexasilanes is contrasted, where a methylated precursor yielded a cyclohexasilane while the  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;functionalized analog unexpectedly yielded a cyclopentasilane. A comprehensive analysis using X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR, HR, HRMS, and multinuclear (  1  H,  13  C and  29  Si) 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy identified the 1,2&#8208;dihydrodisilane  t  BuPhHSi&#8722;SiHPh  t  Bu as an additional product, which was interpreted as supportive of a mechanism involving silylene elimination. The results of this study may prove informative about substituent effects in the practice of complex organosilicon molecular synthesis.</dc:description>

The results of this study may prove informative about substituent effects in the practice of complex organosilicon molecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer bioconjugates prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification of alternating copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;  alt  &#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;  alt  &#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol) aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In the last part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;5 Aryl Substituted Azaspirooxindolinones Derivatives: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation as Potential Inhibitors of Tec Family Kinases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interleukin&#8208;2&#8208;inducible kinase (ITK) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) are two crucial Tec family kinase members with important roles in the development of hematopoietic malignancies, autoimmune disorders and other diseases in humans. Thus, ITK and BTK are key targets for drug development. Spirooxindoles are important scaffolds for the synthesis of small molecules with broad and potent biological activities. In this study, we performed a structure&#8208;activity relationship study of a new series of 5'&#8208;(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)spiro[piperidine&#8208;4,3'&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridin]&#8208;2'(1'H)&#8208;one linked with N&#8208;acyl and C&#8208;5 aryl&#8208;substituted scaffolds in a panel of ITK and BTK cancer cell lines. Four compounds  11  ,  12  ,  14  and  15  showed high antiproliferative activity against ITK and BTK cell lines. Compounds  11  and  12  with a C&#8208;5 benzodioxole group and gem&#8208;dialkyl group attached to carbonyl on piperidine were highly effective in ITK&#8208;high Jurkat and CEM cell lines, and compound  14,  a  biotin analogue,  was identified as a good inhibitor of BTK&#8208;high RAMOS cells. Compound  15  with cyclopropyl group attached to carbonyl on piperidine also showed good activity in ITK and BTK cell lines.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation of helically chiral gold(I) complexes bearing a [5]helicenic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. They were successfully obtained as enantiopure compounds by semi&#8208;preparative chiral HPLC and their structural, chiroptical and photophysical properties were subsequently investigated. Notably, strong electronic circular dichroism, dual emission from singlet and triplet states, with the timescale of the latter up to the millisecond range at room temperature, and moderate circularly phosphorescence were observed. The &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the constituent helical  ortho  &#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbene were investigated by classical quantitative analysis of the IR stretching frequencies and NMR characteristics of the corresponding Ir(CO)  2  Cl complex and selenourea.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;labelled Spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;Derived Building Blocks: Is&#160;Single Fluorine the Best?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reliable methodology for constructing 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is developed. A vast library of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionallized 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks were obtained in a multigram scale (up to 302 g) though the convergent synthetic strategy. This class of compounds was designed for medicinal chemistry as fluorine&#8208;labelled con&#173;formationally restricted isosteres of cyclohexane framework.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reliable methodology for constructing 6-fluoro-spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is developed. A vast library of 2-mono- and 2,2-difunctionallized 6-fluoro-spiro[3.3]heptane-derived building blocks were obtained in a multigram scale (up to 302 g) though the convergent synthetic strategy. This class of compounds was designed for medicinal chemistry as fluorine-labelled con&#173;formationally restricted isosteres of cyclohexane framework. The structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction study and the physico-chemical properties (acidity, lipophilicity and water solubility) were characterized. Finally, the generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software showed that the monofluorinated spiro[3.3]heptane-derived building blocks demonstrated the highest propensity to populate the lead-like chemical space as compared to non- and difluorinated counterparts, as well as cyclohexane derivatives, while retaining similar three-dimensionality features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Scalable High&#8208;Yielding and Selective Oxidative Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling &#8211; A Key Step for the Synthesis of trans&#8208;Stilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step synthesis leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene molecular scaffold was successfully designed and performed. In order to carry out this synthetic pathway, a highly selective and high yielding oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized. A trans&#8208;stilbene derivative [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid]] required in a medicinal chemistry project was successfully up&#8208;scaled (&gt;1000&#215;) and exploited for the production of the substance on a multi&#8208;gram (150&#8197;g) scale.







Abstract
A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted trans&#8208;stilbenes, which revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#8197;g (&gt;1000&#215;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73&#8201;% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90&#8201;%. The inhibitor candidate DC10 [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities (&#8776;33&#8197;g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled&#8208;up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on &gt;100&#8208;gram scale.

We assessed their electrochemical properties and electronic structures by cyclic voltammetry, UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. By establishing the spectroscopic fingerprints of the oxidized and reduced forms, we probe for the possible coexistence of a zwitterionic  TAA  +  &#8208;PTM  &#8208;  valence tautomer (VT), besides neutral  TAA&#8208;PTM  &#8226;  . UV/vis/NIR and EPR spectroscopic studies at variable temperature and in various solvents however provide no indication for such equilibria.

         <dc:description>
Achieving control over the diastereoselectivity of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to obtain maximum number of diastereomers under simple operation is an enduring challenge. In this work, the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides was studied experimentally and theoretically. The reaction produced pyrrolidines (endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts under Ag(I) and Cu(II) catalysis respectively) with four contiguous stereogenic centers bearing a fluorinated quaternary stereogenic center at C4.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides has been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion: in contrast to our previous results where exo&#8208;adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the endo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free&#8208;energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind endo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Azaphilone pigments from Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H.&#160;texense: absolute configuration, bioactivity, and biosynthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new stromatal azaphilone pigments rubiginosins D&#8722;F from the ascomycete  Hypoxylon rubiginosum  , and rubiginosins D and G from  H.&#160;texense  , along with known monomeric and dimeric congeners. Structures were elucidated using comprehensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis, revealing azaphilones from both fungi to be exclusively C&#8209;8(  S  )&#8208;configured. The orsellinic acid (OA)&#8208;carrying rubiginosins A, D and dimeric rutilins A&#8722;B exhibited cytotoxicity, while rubiginosins F&#8722;G bearing linear polyketide side chains and rutilins A&#8722;B were antimicrobial. Structures of the differently&#8208;substituted azaphilones were linked to two putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs;  hraza1  /  2  ) in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  , which are proposed to collaboratively synthesize the OA&#8208;substituted azaphilones. These share high homology with the azaphilone&#8208;forming BGCs  hfaza1  /  2  from  H.&#160;fragiforme  . Comparison of  hraza  and  hfaza  suggests that lack of an FAD&#8208;dependent monooxygenase and acyltransferase gene in  hraza1  prevent formation of C&#8208;8(  R  )&#8208;configured fatty acid&#8208;substituted azaphilones in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  . The polyketide synthase&#8208;derived side chain of rubiginosins C and F&#8722;G is not encoded in the respective BGCs, showing that a third BGC is hypothetically involved in their formation.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Aziridines Via Asymmetric Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclopentenone, a key synthon for the preparation of natural products and many nucleoside inhibitors, was obtained via a new ring&#8208;opening of a strained aziridine in high yields and in moderate (up to 74&#8201;% ee, 87&#8201;:&#8201;13&#8197;er) enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein we report the first organocatalytic method for the desymmetrization of meso&#8208;aziridines that does not require the use of an external nucleophilic reagent. The process was designed upon a base promoted rearrangement of bicyclic meso&#8208;cyclopentanone aziridines, that progresses in intramolecular fashion to provide densely functionalized cyclic ketones, key intermediates for the preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. The key enantio&#8208;determining step proceeded under the catalysis of a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst. The process provides an entry to a class of highly functionalized chiral amines, 4&#8208;aminocyclopentenones, not accessible with previous desymmetrization methods. The ambiphilic nature of the products makes them versatile synthetic intermediates in the preparation of natural products and popular antiviral nucleoside inhibitors, for example abacavir.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

Apart from the corresponding 4-di/trifluoromethyl-2,4-methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane-derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine-tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non-fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead-like chemical space, had higher three-dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead-likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non-fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Catalyzed Cyclization of Bis(enones): A Viable Approach to the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclopentane Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor.







Abstract
Photoredox catalytic cyclization of aryl enones in the presence of visible light, promoted either by metals or organic dyes, represent a valuable strategy for the synthesis of cycloalkanes. The development of a stereoselective version of such transformation, in the presence of the metal&#8208;free catalyst Eosin Y was studied, with the aim to realize an efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings, taking advantage of the flow reactors technology. The use of a chiral auxiliary on the bisenone to be cyclized offers a straightforward and convenient option to exert a stereocontrol on the light&#8208;driven cyclization. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, a functionalized 1,2&#8208;trans cyclopentane ring in up to 83/17 enantiomeric ratio. When the reaction was performed in continuo, in a homemade coil photoreactor, high yields were observed. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor, without any change in the diastereoseletctivity of the process.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5-disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5-azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5-diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X-Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5-diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;-turn and sheet-like peptidomimetics, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
