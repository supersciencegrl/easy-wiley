         <title>Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8208;H Functionalization of Glycinates to Access Diverse Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an operationally simple and green approach to prepare robust &#945;&#8208;alkyl unnatural amino acids via the dual oxidative activation of glycine derivatives and alkylcarboxylic acids with persulfate as the sole oxidizing agent. This method allows the utilization of naturally abundant alkylcarboxylic acids as radical sources without the assistance of catalysts. It is noteworthy that this method allows for the late&#8208;stage decoration of biologically relevant carboxylic acids and peptides to construct diverse unnatural amino acids. In addition, the generality of the oxidative activation method enables to offer a facile synthetic approach to &#945;&#8208;phosphonyl glycine derivatives by using phosphites and phosphine oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Conjugated Dihydroazulene/Vinylheptafulvene Photoswitches in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photoswitches was prepared and studied in various media regarding their photophysical, photochemical, and thermal properties. To pave the way towards the use of DHAs as building blocks in bio(macro)molecules, we synthesized peptide conjugates including the 17&#8208;amino acid ALFA peptide and found excellent switching properties of the biohybrid constructs in aqueous media.&#8201;







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Arylnaphthalene Lignans through a Photochemical Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of arylnaphthalene lignans (ANL) Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3) are described. These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene skeleton (2H&#8208;ANL). The key step of the syntheses is the Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction between arylalkyne moieties, which are connected by a suberate linker unit. The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.







Abstract
The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (ANLs) were developed: Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene moiety (2H&#8208;ANLs). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.[1]

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals bearing p&#8208;brominated positions were synthesized in good yield from halogenated triphenylmethanes obtained by multistep Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were reported as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation. The most blue&#8208;shifted emission among trityl radicals was achieved for the highly fluorinated trityl radical.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two p&#8208;brominated positions, i.&#8201;e. the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data as well as rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Allenes and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates the titanium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;functionalization of secondary amines with either allenes or methylenecyclopropanes. To achieve this, the employed catalyst must act like a wizard, miraculously activating C&#8722;H bonds and thereby combining the starting materials regio&#8208; and stereoselectively.

         <title>Fast Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Oxindoles and Dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones Under Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast transition metal&#8208;free methodology for the synthesis of highly functionalized heterocycles was developed. The exploitation of formamide or N&#8208;methylformamide and potassium persulfate under microwave irradiation resulted in a reaction of 10&#8197;s. The functionalized oxindoles and dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones give access to several spirolactones and spiroimides.







Abstract
A fast transition metal&#8208;free and synthetic methodology for generating a broad scope of highly functionalized oxindoles and dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was developed. The exploitation of formamide or N&#8208;methylformamide (reagent/solvent) and potassium persulfate (radical initiator) under microwave irradiation resulted in a fast radical reaction of 10&#8197;s. The functionalized oxindoles and dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones allowed us to readily access several spirocompounds such as spiro[oxindole&#8208;&#611;&#8208;lactones], spiro[oxindole&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones], spiro[dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;&#611;&#8208;lactones], spiro[oxindole&#8208;imides] and spiro[dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;imides].

         <title>Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution by Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual catalysis: This review covers dual catalytic approaches in kinetic and dynamic kinetic resolutions, mainly highlighting the combination of enzyme&#8208;metal, enzyme&#8208;organo, enzyme&#8208;photoredox, heterobimetallic, and metal&#8208;organo catalysis.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution is one of the most common methods to access enantiomerically enriched compounds. In this method, the resolution is based on the existing difference in reaction rates of the two enantiomers with a chiral catalyst. In the dynamic kinetic resolution, the less reactive enantiomer is racemized and the racemic mixture is further resolved, leading eventually to complete transformation to an enantioenriched compound. This review summarizes the dual catalytic strategies (i.&#8201;e., modular combinations of distinct catalysts) that have been applied to kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic resolution. We focus upon the role of the two catalysts, the compatibility between them, and the practical benefits.

         <title>Photochemical Radical Cation Cycloadditions of Aryl Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report TiO2 photochemical [2+2] and [4+2] cycloadditions using aryl vinyl ethers as radical cation precursors. The construction of various four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings is made possible by these radical cation cycloadditions. The diene is found to be more radicalophilic than the alkene and effectively traps the radical cation of the aryl vinyl ethers.







Abstract
Radical cation cycloadditions have long been known as unique reactions and yet are intensively studied chemical transformations in the field of modern synthetic organic chemistry. The key to developing new reactions of this class is the generation and control of highly reactive radical cation intermediates. Herein, we report TiO2 photochemical [2+2] and [4+2] cycloadditions using aryl vinyl ethers as radical cation precursors. The constructions of various four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings are made possible by these radical cation cycloadditions. Although detailed mechanistic aspects remain unclear, 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (3) is found to be more radicalophilic than 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene (2) and effectively traps the radical cation of the aryl vinyl ethers to construct six&#8208;membered rings.

         <title>DES&#8208;Type Interactions To Promote Solvent&#8208;Free and Metal&#8208;Free Reactions between Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>

The catalyst [1,3&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)imidazolium chloride] interacts under neat conditions with the reagents in a DES&#8208;like manner, providing both substrate activation and reaction media, representing a significant improvement on the way to a lower environmental impact.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are of great interest to organic chemists since they are present in a wide array of bioactive molecules. The use of allylic alcohols to carry out the allylation of heterocycles has been described as a sustainable alternative for this type of functionalization. Among the plethora of methodologies described, the use of metals, solvents, or hazardous reagents is ubiquitous. The protocol described in this work has provided a solven&#8208; and metal&#8208;free alternative, being mediated by the easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and reusable 1,3&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)imidazolium chloride. The protocol has proved to be compatible with several nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles (i.&#8201;e. indole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, carbazole, indazole, and benzotriazole) and allylic alcohols, providing the allylated&#8208;heterocycles in up to quantitative yield, and it's possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale. Based on various green metrics (atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, materials recovery parameter, E&#8208;factor, and EcoScale), the overall greenness significance of the methodology has been proved.

         <title>Perfluorinated Sulfonate Resins as Reusable Heterogeneous Catalysts for the One&#8208;pot Synthesis of DiPhenolic Esters (DPEs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Levulinic acid, easily obtained from cellulose, represents a fundamental chemical platform for a number of valuable building blocks. Among them, diphenolic acid and its esters (DPA and DPE) are valid candidates to replace Bisphenol A in polycarbonate and epoxy resin production processes. In this study, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of alkyl DPEs in the presence of a heterogenous acid catalyst starting from levulinic acid, an alcohol and phenol as solvent&#8208;reagent. The most interesting member of the DPE family, the ethyl 4,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)pentanoate, is selectively obtained in a good yield in the presence of a commercially available heterogeneous acid catalyst, the Aquivion, which can be reused for at least six times without any noticeable loss in activity.</dc:description>

         <title>1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are a fascinating example of strained organic molecules that have found many practical applications due to unusual parallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement of two peri&#8208;aryl rings in close proximity almost perpendicular to the central naphthalene backbone. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes show notable potential as photoluminescent and chiral sensors, stereodynamic switches, nonlinear optic chromophores, blue&#8208;transparent frequency doublers, materials for creating high&#8208;performance blue and green OLEDs, chiral ligands and so on. Molecules of this type have also been used as convenient models for studying &#960;&#8211;&#960;, dipole&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are also interesting as objects to study atropisomeric transformations: if the peri&#8208;aryl rings have ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents, then the anti&#8208;conformer becomes C2&#8208;symmetrical (hence chiral), and the syn&#8208;isomer upon symmetrical substitution is achiral. Despite the extensive knowledge accumulated and the usefulness of these compounds that have become apparent, there are still no reviews on 1,8&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes. In this review, data on synthetic methods, applications, atropisomerism and structural characteristics of 1,8diaryl&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;dihetarylnaphthalenes are summarized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Alkoxy enones are quite useful building blocks in organic chemistry. The existing methods for syntheses of these compounds remain somewhat limited. Over the past years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has emerged as a practical and powerful tool for constructing diverse molecules with the advantages of environmental&#8208;friendly, metal&#8208;free, and mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, alkynone is easy to prepare, can undergo a variety of reactions, and is a commonly used substrate for organic synthesis. &#945;&#8208;Addition of alcohols to alkynones is a direct way to construct &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones. In this study, it was delighted to find that the employment of PPh3 (10 mmol%) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (20 mmol%) could redirect from the &#946;&#8208;addition mode to &#945;&#8208;addition. With this approach, a variety of &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones could be obtained directly with good yields and regioselectivity. Under optimal conditions, the generality of the reaction was investigated. Substrate scope studies showed that the reaction was well tolerated with many alcohols. Mechanistic study is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies to Fused 5/5/6&#8208;Tricyclic Frameworks: Access to Presilphiperfolanol Analogues and A, B, C&#8208;Ring System of Lycopodium Alkaloids and Cyclopiane Diterpenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe new synthetic approaches to fused 5/5/6&#8208;carbocyclic frameworks present in various polycyclic natural products such as presilphiperfolanols, lycopodium alkaloids and cyclopiane diterpenes. Our work features, a strategically introduced hydroxy group at the tert&#8208;carbon center of the tricyclic system which is present in presilphiperfolanols. In addition, one presilphiperfolanol analogue is reported to show the potential of strategies disclosed in this work. All the new compounds are characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectral data. The structures of critical compounds were confirmed by various chemical transformations and further supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Overall, our approach is simple and rely on readily available starting materials, and involves a tandem&#8208;metathesis sequence. The synthetic studies disclosed here are applicable to the synthesis of natural products and to design medicinally important targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2-(bromomethyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;-elimination observed with &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly.

         <title>Palladium&#8208; and Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Deracemization of Allylic Oxygen Compounds with Oxygen Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic oxygen compounds are versatile building blocks in natural and non&#8208;natural product synthesis. This review describes the deracemization of racemic allylic oxygen compounds through palladium&#8208; and iridium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) with oxygen nucleophiles. Discussed is the DYKAT of allylic alcohols, allylic carboxylates, allylic imidates, vinyl oxiranes and vinyl dioxolanones by using water, alcohols, phenols, diosphenols, carboxylates, oximes and hydrogen carbonate as nucleophiles. Highlighted is the application of Trost's bisphosphinobenzamides as ligands in palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed deracemization and Carreira&#8208;Dorta's BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite&#8208;olefin as ligand in iridium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT. This review also discusses experimental and computational studies of &#951;3&#8208;allylpalladium and &#951;3&#8208;allyliridium complexes involved in the catalytic cycles.







Abstract
Allylic oxygen compounds (AOCs) are an important class of versatile building blocks in natural and non&#8208;natural product synthesis. Catalytic in&#8208;situ deracemization is an attractive means for their enantioselective synthesis. Particularly attractive is the deracemization of AOCs through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) with oxygen nucleophiles (ONus). This review describes pertinent aspects of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT of racemic allylic carboxylates, vinyl oxiranes and vinyl dioxolanones with carboxylates, hydrogen carbonate, alcohols, phenols, oximes, diosphenols and water and the iridium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT of racemic allylic alcohols, imidates and carboxylates with alcohols and carboxylic acids. Included in the discussion is the palladium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of meso&#8208;cycloalkene bis(carboxylates) with hydrogen carbonate. While Trost's bisphosphinobenzamides, Zhou's spiro&#8208;phosphoramidite and Feringa's BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite are highly efficient ligands in palladium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT, Carreira&#8208;Dorta's BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite&#8208;olefin is an excellent ligand in iridium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT. This review also discusses mechanistic and structural aspects of &#951;3&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;bisphosphinobenzamide and &#951;3&#8208;allyliridium&#8208;BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite&#8208;olefin complexes and of the corresponding catalysts.

         <title>Unconventional and Sustainable Synthesis of Polymethine Dyes: Critical Overview and Perspectives within the Framework of the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically analyzes the synthetic routes followed to prepare polymethine dyes, providing the reader a critical overview on the synthetic processes within the framework of the twelve principles of green chemistry. A detailed critical evaluation in terms of two complementary green chemistry metrics like the EcoScale and the E factor is provided.







Abstract
Time, energy, and cost saving; waste reduction; health and safety preservation represent true milestones of green chemistry, as well as some of the most important aspects for the industrial synthesis of molecules having relevant technological applications. Herein, in the light of the non&#8208;conventional and sustainable approaches towards polymethine dyes that appeared in the literature in the last decade, the twelve principles of green chemistry serve as a guideline for a critical overview of such protocols. The E factor and the EcoScale score for the considered procedures are also assessed, to provide numerical parameters for the evaluation of their impact.

         <title>A Facile Electrochemical Strategy for the Azidation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free route for the azidation of benzylic C&#8722;H is obtained through an environmentally friendly and efficient electrochemical azidation reaction of alkylbenzene with TMSN3.







Abstract
We report a direct azidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via an electrochemical process, which use cheap and durable graphite plates as electrodes, without any external oxidants or metal catalysts. This protocol is a novel, green and environmentally benign synthetic strategy to achieve azidation of C(sp3)&#8722;H in benzylic group. More importantly, these azidation products are suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization to afford diversified triazole and tetrazole derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cyclopropanation: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly summarized recent advances in visible light&#8208;mediated cyclopropanation reactions with mainly focusing on the visible light&#8208;induced carbene transfer cyclopropanation and photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation involving radical pathway.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are one of the most important strained rings existing in various pharmaceutical products and secondary metabolites. They are also widely used in total synthesis of natural products, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. In the past years, photochemical cyclopropanation has been gradually developed as a robust and attractive synthetic method to prepare diverse cyclopropane backbones. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the visible light&#8208;mediated cyclopropane synthesis, especially in photochemical cyclopropanation using carbene transfer strategy and photocatalytic radical cyclopropanation reactions.

         <title>Structures and Applications of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens Containing Benzobisthiadiazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II AIEgens fluorescent molecular probes have attracted great research interests due to their great potential in organic semiconductors and bioimaging materials development. This review highlights recent breakthrough results in AIE nanoprobes bearing a benzobisthiadiazole derivatives, with an emphasis on bioapplications.







Abstract
AIEgens fluorescent molecular probes in the NIR&#8208;II window have attracted much attention owning to their deep penetration, reduction of tissue absorption and scattering, excellent photostability, and low cytotoxicity. Among them, as strong electron&#8208;absorbing group, benzobisthiadiazole derivatives are widely used in the construction of various NIR&#8208;II AIEgens materials. In this review, we concluded AIEgens nanoprobes bearing benzobisthiadiazole derivatives in the NIR&#8208;II region. Beginning with a summary of molecular design, recent advances in bioimaging and photodynamic therapy as well as insights and challenges in this thriving field were discussed. We expect that this review will provide perspectives on the potential applications of benzobisthiadiazole&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II AIEgens nanoprobes in biomedical field and inspire more creative progresses in this research discipline to facilitate the investigation in future clinical translation.

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene Cocatalyzed Catellani&#8208;Type Domino Reaction with Aryl Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of KI, aryl diazonium salts are suitable substrates for Catellani&#8208;type ortho arylation and amination reactions, allowing for the quick construction of multifunctionalized aromatic products.







Abstract
The palladium/norbornene co&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of haloarenes provides a facile and efficient method for the synthesis of polyfunctional aromatic compounds. However, the suitable substrates for such a transformation have been strictly limited to haloarenes. We here demonstrate that aryl diazonium salts could be well employed as substrates in these reactions, enabling arylbromides with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to be used as cross&#8208;coupling partners.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylacetamides Substituted Maleimide Via Weakly Coordinating Acetamide Assisted Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Coupling and Their Photophysical Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a general and effective method for the functionalization of maleimide with arylacetamides via weakly monodentate primary amide as a directing group through the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling process. Exclusive Heck&#8208;type products were obtained under the optimized reaction conditions with large functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Maleimides serve as an important synthetic precursor for various organic transformation reactions. However, maleimides have been rarely employed as coupling partners for the direct synthesis of 3&#8208;aryl substituted maleimides via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction, due to the lack of &#946;&#8208;hydrogen at the syn&#8208;periplanar position. Therefore, herein, we report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of 3&#8208;arylacetamide incorporated maleimides through the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling process using the simple and native primary acetamide as a weakly directing group with Pd(II)&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reaction furnishes 3&#8208;arylated maleimide derivatives in good yields with high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, 3&#8208;arylated maleimides were transformed into synthetically important derivatives. Based on preliminary control experiments, a probable reaction mechanism has been proposed for the distal C&#8722;H bond functionalization reaction. Interesting photophysical properties of the synthesized products were also observed.

         <title>Transmembrane Chloride Transport by Diphosphine&#8208;Pd(II) Complexes: Effect of the Ligand Geometry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diphosphine&#8722;Pd(II) complexes transport chloride across phospholipid membranes with high efficiency and selectivity. Their transport activity is mostly influenced by their lipophilicity while other parameters such as the bite angle of the diphosphine ligand and the electronic properties of the substituents play less relevant roles. Moreover, transport activity is observed with other metal ions (Ni(II) and Cu(I)) prompting diphosphine&#8211;metal complexes as a new class of anion carriers.







Abstract
Transmembrane chloride transport is a fundamental biological process, and its impairment is at the origin of severe genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Synthetic anion carriers able to transport chloride and other anions across biological membranes are considered as putative candidates for treating these syndromes. We have proposed diphosphine&#8211;Pd(II) complexes as a new class of anion carriers and in this contribution we have investigated the ionophoric activity of a family of Pd(II) complexes with diphosphine chelating ligands differing for the ligand bite angle that is varied from 71&#176; (dppm) to 98&#176; (dppb). Moreover, in the case of the dppe ligand we also investigated the effect of the introduction in the ligand structure of alkyl substituents of increasing length and hydrophobicity and of electron donor and withdrawing substituents. All the complexes investigated are able to transport chloride across the phospholipid membrane of liposomes and the most important parameter influencing their relative efficacy is the lipophilicity of the complex with the highest activity observed for [Pd(pEt&#8208;dppe)Cl2]. On the contrary the bite angle of the ligand appears to be not relevant while the activity is diminished by the insertion of both EWG and EDG groups on the phenyl substituents of the phosphine ligands. Finally, also Ni(II) and Cu(I) complexes display ionophoric activity demonstrating that the transport ability of metal complexes is not limited to Pd(II) metal ion.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Physovenine via Electrochemical C&#8211;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated an electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation approach to (&#177;)&#8208;physovenine. The reaction conditions are mild compared to canonical routes, which typically utilize strong hydride reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride. This enabled extension of the electrochemical cyclization to a substrate bearing the fully functionalized phenyl ring of the natural product. The electrochemical cyclization is diasetereoselective and starting from enantiopure substrate would provide a single enantiomer of physovenine. In the course of an initial formal synthesis, we identified conditions to afford modest enantioselective substrate synthesis that demonstrate the feasibility of an enantioselective synthesis. Among the substrates investigated, acetyl&#8208;, tosyl&#8208; or Boc&#8208;nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2&#8208;position of the indoline. This work expands the utility of electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation and provides a foundation for further applications to functionalized cyclic ether construction.</dc:description>

Among the substrates investigated, acetyl-, tosyl- or Boc-nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2-position of the indoline. This work expands the utility of electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation and provides a foundation for further applications to functionalized cyclic ether construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Electrophilic Chlorination and Catalytic Nitration of N&#8208;Tosyl Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient iodine(III)&#8208;based protocol for the chlorination and catalytic nitration of N&#8208;tosyl anilines as well as the proposed reaction mechanism is described. The synergistic combination of the commercially available [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) with AlCl3, or (PhIO)n with Al(NO3)3, allowed the electrophilic introduction of the chlorine and nitro group in the N&#8208;tosyl aniline core in non&#8208;acidic conditions under a common strategy. Our DFT theoretical calculations, performed for the chlorination process, indicate that this occurs through a cationic pathway in which the [Cl&#8208;PhI+&#160; &#8208; OTFA&#183;AlCl3] is the chlorinating species and is formed under neutral conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphite&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfones in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and feasible protocol toward the synthesis of sulfones and &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones was developed using graphite powder as a reusable and non&#8208;expensive catalyst by sulfonylation of halides in aqueous medium.







Abstract
Developing mild sustainable protocols for the synthesis of sulfones remains a challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the synthesis of sulfones from organic halides and sodium salts of sulfinic acids using graphite powder as reusable catalyst and water as solvent at room temperature. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope, functional group tolerance, easy extraction conditions, and the products were isolated without the need of further purification. When &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;ketones were used as substrates, the corresponding &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones were also obtained in good yields. The method is general and can also be used on larger scale.

Abstract
An enantioselective organocatalytic reaction of indole&#8208;derived&#8208;1&#8208;azadienes with aldehydes leading the formation of enantioenriched cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals is reported. The corresponding products can be obtained with high levels of stereoselectivity (de &gt;95&#8201;%, 65&#8211;99&#8201;% ee, 8&#8211;98&#8201;% yield). Furthermore, fused tetracyclic scaffolds can also be obtained by implementing a one&#8208;pot strategy involving an additional oxa&#8208;Michael reaction from aldehydes bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone group.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates how solvent dynamics and salt effects control the structure and reactivity of organozinc reagents by showing a flow of THF molecules solvating a dimer of methylzinc chloride getting out of the ocean vortex drawn by U. Hiroshigue. The whirlpool illustrates the hidden complexity of organozinc reagents, while the whirlwind of molecules represents the ongoing efforts to extract a rational at the molecular level. More information can be found in the Perspective by J. Rio, L. Perrin, and P.&#8208;A. Payard.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization&#8208;Negishi Coupling of Redox Active Esters for the Synthesis of Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting nickel radical behaviour: powerful consecutive formation of two C&#8722;C bonds, including a ring&#8208;closing reaction, allows the preparation of functionalized pyrrolidines in a single synthetic operation which also avoids the use of halogen&#8208;containing electrophiles.







Abstract
We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization/Negishi&#8208;coupling reaction for the formation of pyrrolidines and pyrrolidinones starting from N&#8208;protected allylamines and acrylamides which contain a redox active ester group. The reaction provides two C&#8722;C bonds in a single operation and takes place with both alkylzinc and arylzinc bromides as nucleophiles. Activation of RAE by low valent Ni complexes involving a radical pathway followed by a fast cyclization of intermediate carbon radicals is proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene and Pyrene End&#8208;Capped Triarylamines for p&#8208;Channel High&#8208;Performance OFETs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthracene and pyrene end&#8208;capped ethynyl styrylene bridged triarylamines with D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8217; architectures were synthesized to explore the influence of donor motifs on OFET properties. The fabricated BGTC device exhibited p&#8208;channel behavior with high mobility and on/off current ratio up to 2.6&#8197;cm2/Vs and 107 and a low threshold voltage of &#8722;9&#8197;V, respectively.







Abstract
A series of new anthracene/pyrene functionalized triarylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8217; semiconductors are demonstrated as p&#8208;channel material for high&#8208;performance OFETs. The introduction of electron&#8208;donating end&#8208;caps and ethynyl styrylene bridged spacers at D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8217; architecture modulated the self&#8208;ordering, electron distribution, and field&#8208;effect mobility. These molecules exhibited high&#8208;lying HOMO of &#8764;4.8&#8197;eV, enabling the hole&#8208;transporting property and reducing the energy barrier for charge injection. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated on bottom&#8208;gated top&#8208;contact architecture containing pyrene end&#8208;capped triarylamines with tert&#8208;butylphenyl sidearm as active layer displayed high hole mobility of 2.5&#8197;cm2/Vs and on/off current ratio of 107, and the threshold voltage of &#8722;7&#8197;V. The highest performance was supported by the molecular order of the film, planarity, high HOMO, and electron&#8208;donating nature of the end&#8208;capping units, as illustrated by the SEM, XRD, and DFT studies.

         <title>Diboration of Alkynes Accelerated by Synergistic Effects of Ruthenium Complexes and Phenoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diboration of alkynes accelerated by ruthenium complexes and phenoxides is disclosed. The combination of ruthenium and base catalysts and the addition of methanol have significant effects on the product yields. The obtained diboryl alkenes are easily transformed into corresponding tetrasubstituted alkenes by two&#8208;step Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions.







Abstract
Alkynes react with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) in the presence of 5&#8211;10&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Cp*RuCl2]n to afford the corresponding (Z)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diboryl alkenes. The addition of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% NaOC6H4(4&#8208;tBu) and 2&#8211;5&#8197;equiv. of methanol was essential for the reaction to proceed with high product yield. Various alkynes were employed in the reaction, and the obtained 1,2&#8208;diboryl alkenes were used as precursors for tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship of Organozinc and Organozincate Reagents: Key Elements towards Molecular Understanding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 44, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of organozinc reagents is dictated by a subtle choice of reaction conditions such as solvents, additives, and concentration. In this perspective article, some of the key parameters that allow an efficient control of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of organozinc and organozincate reagents in solution are reviewed. The appropriate modeling strategies to address these complex chemical systems are discussed.







Abstract
The main parameters that influence the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of organozinc and organozincate reagents are gathered in this perspective article. Influences of substituents, inorganic salts, and solvents are discussed and illustrated with examples from the literature. Based on the peculiarities of this chemical system, the perspective is enlarged by molecular modelling considerations to raise the comprehension at the molecular scale of structure&#8211;activity relationships of organozinc and organozincate reagents in solution.

         <dc:description>
Completely stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;azanucleosides was achieved. Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox&#8208;induced N&#8208;&#945; hydroxylation and continuous C&#8208;glycosidation gave desired C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Herein, we report a practical method for de novo preparation of imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late&#8208;stage anomeric derivatization by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformations of oxime ethers and sulfonyl azides were carried out to efficiently afford isoxazolidine. The reaction involved the tandem CuAAC/ring cleavage/ rare 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization procedures under mild condition. This methodology appears quite flexible and offers a capacity to generate the 2&#8208;vinyl isoxazolidine products.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalysed C&#8208;H Borylation of Fluoroarenes: Insights into the Balance between Steric and Electronic Control of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iridium catalysed C&#8208;H borylation of per&#8208; and polyfluorinated arenes and heteroarenes occurs rapidly and efficiently. As with other borylation reactions, whilst steric parameters dominate, an underlying electronic influence on reaction selectivity can be observed. Notably borylation regioselectivity in fluorinated (hetero)arenes is determined by purely electronic effects except for  ortho  &#8208;borylation between two fluorine atoms where steric effects of fluorine substituents become apparent. Borylation at the  para  position with respect to fluorine is disfavoured whereas a strong electronic preference for borylation  para  to the azinyl nitrogen of pyridine is observed. When these features co&#8208;operate high selectivity can be expected. For these reactions, computations based on transition state, rather than intermediate, energies in iridium geometries showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessment of the Electrochemical Synthesis Route to Silicones Starting from Silica as Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for alternatives to the industrial highly energy intensive process for the conversion of silica as feedstock to silicones led us to critically evaluate the previously described direct electrochemical pathway. We successfully achieved methylation of various SiO2 sources to cyclic methylsiloxanes via electroreduction reaction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the reaction does not start from methanol as methyl radical source, that results in methoxylation of the electrolyte solvent. Methylammonium cations were found to enable the direct conversion, strongly dependent on the radical intermediate stabilization by the electrolyte. THF / Bu4NCF3SO3 is the sole applicable system with current yields below 6% obtained so far. Mechanistic insights show that methylation does not occur via the supposed hydrolysis of dimethoxydimethylsilane intermediate, but via a direct depolymerization reaction, as comparative studies of a Fenton&#8208;type procedure clearly indicate. Further, cyclic methylsiloxane products are prone to subsequent electrochemical equilibration, strongly directed by the electrolyte solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Three complementary one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction sequences for rapid, general and direct spiropyran synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component reaction sequences for spiropyran synthesis have been developed, based around three different methods for in&#8208;situ generation of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoles (indole N&#8208;alkylation, Fischer indolisation and indole C&#8208;alkylation), preceding common indole C&#8208;alkylation and condensation steps. The reaction sequences are complementary with respect to their substrates and conditions, hence they facilitate access to a broad swathe of spiropyran structures, and each sequence is operationally straightforward, rapid and high yielding. We have explored the scope of these highly efficient processes in the synthesis of 58 structurally diverse spiropyrans bearing a wide range of useful functional groups, and we have demonstrated their utility in the targeted synthesis of potential ratiometric fluorescence probes for metal ions and spiropyran&#8208;cholesterol conjugates as tools for cell membrane research. Finally, we have demonstrated that our one&#8208;pot N&#8208;alkylation&#8211;C&#8208;alkylation&#8211;condensation sequence can underpin combinatorial spiropyran synthesis through generation of a 16&#8208;member spiropyran library.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;Bridged Bis&#8208;Quinolinium Dyes. Studies Toward the Dependence of Different Types of Conjugation on Spectroscopic Properties.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicationic bisquinolinium salts possessing different types of conjugation are presented in which the hetareniums are separated by acetylenic or 1,4&#8208;diethynylbenzene spacers. Cross&#8208;conjugation is induced by interconnections via the 3&#8208;positions of the heteroareniums, and conjugation is realized by 2,2/2,4/4,4&#8208;interconnections. We also synthesized mixed cross&#8208;conjugated/conjugated 2,3/4,3&#8208;interconnected species. The different types of conjugation determine the charge distribution according to the rules of resonance which translate into characteristic 13C NMR as well as UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopic properties, LUMO geometries, and chemical properties. We found that the triple bond&#180;s resonance frequencies are sensitive 13C NMR spectroscopic indicators for the type of conjugation. Combining cross&#8208;conjugated and conjugated structure elements of dicationic bis&#8208;quinolinium dyes via triple bonds without additional benzene spacer results in considerable bathochromic shifts of the UV&#8208;Vis absorption maxima [&#916;&#955;max &#8776; 100 nm]. A charge transfer was calculated from the HOMO of the conjugated into the LUMO of the cross&#8208;conjugated partial structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Spiro Derivatives: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro derivatives are important scaffolding substances found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. In the last decade, numerous new approaches based on multicomponent reactions have been explored for the selective and efficient development of new spiro derivatives using various organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems. This review article addresses the pioneering advances in the field of catalytic stereoselective multicomponent reactions for the preparation of various spiro derivatives. These include stereoselective Michael cascade cyclization reactions, cycloadditions, diastereoselective reactions, and miscellaneous reactions for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;hetero/carbocycles. Advances in the last decade have made it possible to synthesize various spiro compounds with good to excellent stereoselectivity under appropriate reaction conditions. However, achieving high regioselectivity in several described multicomponent reactions remains a challenge. Insightful proposed catalytic mechanisms and supporting evidence are highlighted in the review. Organocatalysts and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts play a crucial role in achieving this milestone. The progress described in catalytic stereoselective approaches for spiro derivatives is immense. However, it is expected that new stereoselective synthetic methods will soon be developed that can be widely used for the preparation of spiro&#8208;heterocycles/carbocycles.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8208;H bonds was observed. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50 &#181;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;Conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediates&#160;Free&#8208;Aniline&#160;Iodination through Acetyl Hypoiodite Formation: Study of the Reaction Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first iodine(III)&#8208;mediated  para  &#8208;selective iodination protocol for free&#8208;anilines as well as the mechanistic elucidation of the reaction pathway is described. The developed method proceeded under clean, non&#8208;toxic, efficient and in general mild reaction conditions. To the best of our knowledge this report describes for the first time a procedure focused specifically on the introduction of an iodine atom in free anilines using PIDA [(diacetoxyiodo)benzene] and ammonium iodide which formed  in situ  acetyl hypoiodite (AcO&#8208;  I  ) as the halogenating species. Our DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism that highlights the catalytic role of the ammonium cation in the AcO&#8208;  I  formation and halogenation. Considering there are few procedures for the iodine atom introduction in anilines using non&#8208;acidic conditions, herein we described an initial report on a mild and operationally simple alternative using iodine(III) reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>HBF4&#8208;Catalyzed 3,6&#8208;Bis&#8208;diarylmethylation of Carbazoles with para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we demonstrate an atom economical, practical, mild and selective HBF4&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of carbazoles to para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) to access 3,6&#8208;bis&#8208;diarylmethyl&#8208; and mono&#8208;diarylmethyl carbazoles. This metal and additive free protocol provides a convenient access to the substituted carbazole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with a good functional group tolerance. It was found that a couple of 3,6&#8208;disubstituted carbazoles showed interesting photophysical properties and, therefore, might potentially find some applications as host materials in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants of &#945;'&#8208;substituted BTEs (open and closed) correlate linearly with the excitation energies of the absorption maxima applying the spectroscopic Hammett equation.







Abstract
Series of photochromic 1,2&#8208;bis(thienyl)ethenes possessing perfluorocyclopentene backbones, either hydrogen or methyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the thiophenes, and a variety of substituents in their &#945;'&#8208;positions were prepared, which cover the range from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing (Me, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;OTBS, &#8722;TMS, &#8722;Br, 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;yl, pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;COOH). As a linear free energy relationship the spectroscopic Hammett equation gives fair to excellent fits to the excitation energy of the absorption maxima of the ring&#8208;opened as well as the ring&#8208;closed forms of the BTEs, when Hammett substituent constants &#963;p were replaced by Brown's modified substituent constants &#963;p+ and &#963;p&#8722;. Vice versa, hitherto unknown Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants can be estimated from the UV spectra. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured absorption maxima with values which we calculated by three different methods (DFT STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD/def2&#8208;TZVPP, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31G*, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;311++G**).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, trifluoromethylaminating reagent, and TMSCN has been established. A variety of trifluoromethylaminated allenes were obtained in good yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes with readily available trifluoromethylaminating reagent and TMSCN was developed. This reaction proceeded at mild conditions, affording the corresponding trifluoromethylaminated allenes in good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic application of the resulting products has also been demonstrated by the transformation to N&#8722;CF3 oxazolidinones.

Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community as a versatile synthon for the construction of N&#8208;heterocycles. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations, as proposed by Sheehan in the 1960s have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community, owing to their diverse reactivity profile for constructing N&#8208;scaffolds of biological interest. During its initial growth, aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations were used effectively as a 3&#8208;unit synthon as 1,3 dipoles to create N&#8208;heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions, wherein aza&#8208;oxyallyl cation served as electrophilic counterpart. Recently, new variations of aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations reactivity have been reported, including its usage as a 1,4 dipole in cycloaddition reactions, domino reactions, and the unique alkylating ability of heteroatoms. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of the Benzotropolone/Bis(pulvinone) Natural Product Aurantricholone Exploiting New Strategies for Establishing Benzotropolones and Z&#8208;Configured Pulvinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aurantricholone as well as its calcium and lithium salts, all of which represent the coloring principle of the fungus Tricholoma aurantium, were synthesized for the first time, namely in 15 steps, 10 of which were our longest linear sequence. We developed an access to benzotropolones after dibromocyclopropanating alkyl or silyl enol ethers of 1&#8208;tetralones. Successive treatments with DMAP&#8208;N&#8208;oxide and Ac2O effected ring&#8208;enlargement, oxidation, and acetylation. O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzotropolone obtained there&#173;by &#8208; similarly as unsubstituted benzotropolone &#8208; was bromin&#173;ated at C&#8208;8 in two steps by adopting our recently published bro&#173;mination protocol for otherwise unsubstituted O&#8208;acetylbenzotropolone. Thereafter, a double and doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki&#8208;coupling with a newly introduced boronate es&#173;tablished the O&#8208;methylated pulvinone moiety as well as the O&#8208;meth&#173;ylated &#8220;pulvinone&#8208;like&#8221; motif of what altogether equalled the completed aurantricholone scaffold. Its deprotection (two steps) furnished the title compound either as its protonated form or its calcium or lithium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>C(spn)&#8211;X (n = 1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Iron</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative addition of C(spn)&#8211;X bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH3, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H3C&#8211;CH2&#8211;X, H2C=CH&#8211;X and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X to Fe(CO)4 was investigated using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OPBE/TZ2P. The C(spn)&#8211;X bonds become substantially stronger going from C(sp3)&#8211;X to C(sp2)&#8211;X to C(sp)&#8211;X, whereas the oxidative addition reaction barrier decreases along this series. Our activation strain and energy decomposition analyses expose that the decreased reaction barrier for the oxidative addition going from sp3 to sp2 to sp stems from a relief of the destabilizing (steric) Pauli repulsion between the catalyst and substrate. This originates from the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom that goes from four in C(sp3)&#8211;X to three in C(sp2)&#8211;X to two in C(sp)&#8211;X. In analogy with our previous results on palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative additions, this enhances the stabilizing catalyst&#8211; substrate interaction, which is able to overcome the more destabilizing strain associated with the stronger C(spn)&#8211;X bonds. This work again demonstrates that iron&#8208;based catalysts can resemble the behavior of their well&#8208;known palladium analogs in the oxidative addition step of cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on a series of phenothiazine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D type cross&#8208;conjugated non&#8208;doped red&#8208;emitting molecules synthesized by simple Claisen&#8208;Schmidt condensation, which exhibit excellent AIEE phenomena through the formation of large&#8208;sized nano&#8208;aggregates. These thermally stable red fluorescent organic materials have low band gap energies (Eg&#160;= 1.84&#8208;2.15 eV) and also display reversible mechanofluorochromism. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of red emissive ground powders were closer to the standard red&#8208;light chromaticity coordinates. These chalcones also exhibited positive solvatochromism, and large Stokes shifts. Finally, these compounds were utilized as reversible volatile acid sensors to detect TFA in solution as well as in solid state, by virtue of the presence of electron withdrawing carbonyl oxygen, and they could detect TFA at a concentration as low as 15.8 ppm in the presence of&#160;C4.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Azidoesterification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol has been developed for the azidoesterification of alkenes, providing a practical method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
We report an efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic approach for azidoesterification of alkenes. The reaction proceeds by electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of commercially available carbazates to produce alkoxycarbonyl radicals. Upon addition across alkenes, the generated transient carbon&#8208;centered radicals get trapped by azido metal complexes to furnish the alkene difunctionalization products. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of alkenes into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;azido esters in good to excellent yields, thereby providing a practical access to &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials.

         <title>100 Years of Vitamin E: From Discovery to Commercialization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2022 marks the centenary of the discovery of vitamin E by Evans and Bishop, an important milestone in vitamin research. An enormous amount of scientific data related to the importance of its activity has been published on this micronutrient. Globally, researchers from industry and academia have contributed to improve and implement highly efficient and commercially viable production processes for vitamin E. All processes share a common final step, but differ in the generation of their key building blocks. Today, Vitamin E, accounts for a worldwide production of &gt;75.000 t/a. Vitamin E is applied predominantly as feed supplement for various animal species and in addition is used in a variety of human applications. Moreover, its impressive antioxidative behavior enables frequent use as stabilizing ingredient in many product forms and final consumer applications. This review will provide the current state of science, with clear focus on highlighting the different routes for industrial syntheses of vitamin E. Furthermore, approaches directed towards successful product form development including suitable auxiliary substances combined with appropriate formulation technologies, as well as a broad variety of applications in animal and human nutrition and health will be discussed. Insights on isolation approaches, biosynthesis, and future trends complete the status of Vitamin E research.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryltriazenes as Coupling Partners in the Hiyama, Hiyama&#8208;Suzuki and Hiyama&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions Using Conventional and Ionic Liquid Reagents and Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Application of conventional and ionic liquid (IL) solvents and reagents in the Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reactions using triazenes as coupling partners was investigated. The microwave&#8208;assisted and Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions in ROH/HBF4, ROH/BF3.Et2O and in [BMIM][X]/[BMIM(SO3H)][OTf]/[BMIM][F] proved effective and gave respectable isolated yields within minutes. The scope of the Hiyama coupling reaction with triazenes was investigated in these media. The IL reagents and solvents were successfully employed to develop stepwise and sequential/tandem Hiyama&#8208;Suzuki (H&#8208;S) and Hiyama&#8208;Heck (H&#8208;H) methods. Study of the scope of these transformations led to facile synthesis of libraries of biaryls, hetero&#8208;biaryls, diphenylmethanes, styryl&#8208;biphenyls, and a host of biphenyl&#8208;appended heterocycles. The potential for the recycling/reuse of the IL solvents in the Hiyama reaction, and in stepwise and sequential transformations was also examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Catalyst&#8208;Free Access to Phthalazines: Entry to Antiviral Model Drugs by Merging Domino Reactions
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light as air: A straightforward metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access new high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl&#8208;Group Exchange Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and an Aroyl Fluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride has been developed. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride as a novel deoxyfluorination reagent.







Abstract
Acyl fluorides show unique reactivity and stability, and the catalytic conversions using acyl fluorides as a divergent building block have recently attracted much attention and have been rapidly researched. Thus, a development of a new synthetic method of acyl fluorides is constantly demanded. Herein, we describe a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride. This report is the first example of utilizing an acyl fluoride as a deoxyfluorination reagent.

         <title>Expeditious and Stereoselective Synthesis of (1S)&#8208;Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] were synthesized in two steps from  exo  &#8208;glycals. The first step involved the double additions of aniline (or substituted anilines) to produce  C,N  &#8208;glycosides. The next step was to eliminate the anomeric  N&#8208;  aryl group by formation of benzophenone&#8208;derived imine, followed by  in&#8208;situ  intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. The two steps could be performed consecutively in one&#8208;pot manner at 75 &#176;C, leading to formation of (1  S  )&#8208;spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] in 60&#8208;72% overall yields with exclusive (from the reactions of  exo  &#8208;galactals) or high stereoselectivity (from those of  exo  &#8208;glucals with  m  &#8208;substituted anilines), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The synthesis of 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole (3), 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole (4&#8208;Iso1), 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole (4&#8208;Iso2), 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;tetrazole (5&#8208;Iso1), 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;tetrazole (5&#8208;Iso2) and 5&#8208;(3&#8208;azidooxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;ol (6&#8208;Iso2) is reported. Methylation with dimethyl sulfate, amination with O&#8208;tosylhydroxyl&#8208;amine (TOSA) and hydroxylation with Oxone&#174; yielded (mostly) isomers of the respective target molecules 4&#8208;Iso1, 4&#8208;Iso2, 5&#8208;Iso1, 5&#8208;Iso2 and 6&#8208;Iso2.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a C&#8208;H activation protocol of 2&#8208;arylbenzoxazinones in aqueous medium under open aerial atmosphere at close to room temperature (40 oC) using magnetic Pd&#8208;catalyst. 2&#8208;Arylbenzoxazinones react with phenylglyoxylic acids via decarboxylative C&#8208;H acylation followed by cyclization reaction to produce the isoindolinone compounds. The reaction can be arrested at the intermediate step to obtain the ortho&#8208;acylated derivative at a certain lower temperature. The heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyst is easy to separate magnetically and shows good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Site Selectivity in Phosphorylation of Amphiphilic Diols through Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalysts based on a nucleophilic core, decorated with long hydrocarbon or oligoether outer&#8208;sphere tails were successfully applied for attenuating the site selectivity in phosphorylation of a model amphiphilic diol. Under the influence of the catalysts, the preference for the first functionalization of the hydroxyl at the apolar domain increased dramatically to render the ratio of up to 3.9:1 between the monophosphorylated products, at 50 % substrate consumption (vs. 1.8:1 in the alike reaction without the catalyst). A considerable influence of the catalyst design, particularly the core nature and the tails structure, on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction was observed.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organocatalysts based on a nucleophilic core, decorated with long hydrocarbon or oligoether outer-sphere tails were successfully applied for attenuating the site selectivity in phosphorylation of a model amphiphilic diol.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Bidentate N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Supported Si(IV) Dicationic Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis and isolation of Si(IV) dications stabilized by a bidentate  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP). Treatment of the bis(NHCP) with Si(IV) bis(triflate) (R  2  Si(OTf)  2  with R = H, Ph) resulted in the instant formation of Si(IV) dicationic complexes [  2a  ] and [  2b  ] featuring a tetracoordinated silicon centre. The dications show expected high Lewis acidity. The bis(NHCP) stabilized parent silyl dication (SiH  2  2+  ) presents the first isolable example of a parent SiH  2  dication. In addition, dication [  2a  ] is able to react with diphenylketene via insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Nintedanib&#8208;&#945;V&#946;3 Integrin Ligand Dual&#8208;Targeting Conjugates towards Precision Treatment of Melanoma</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and more than 150,000 cases are diagnosed every year in Europe. New strategies in treatment approved over the past decade, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy, have prolonged life expectation even in stage IV melanoma patients. However, due to the increasing incidence of this cancer, the development of new therapeutic strategies remains urgent. Recent studies revealed the combination of nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as an antifibrotic drug, and immuno&#8208; and/or targeted therapy drugs to be promising. Here we present three new dual covalent conjugates, in which a nintedanib unit is permanently linked to a cyclopeptidomimetic ligand for the &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell survival, proliferation and migration, which is overexpressed by tumour cells, and therefore recognized as marker for tumour targeting. In vitro assays on human melanoma tumour cells confirmed the high binding affinity of these conjugates for &#945;V&#946;3 integrin&#8208;positive melanoma cells, as well as their integrin&#8208;mediated cell internalization. Two of these conjugates were efficient in inhibiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, common to both integrin&#8208; and growth factor&#8208; biological targets.
Such targeted conjugates could therefore be of special interest in melanoma treatment alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Exploration of Novel Sulfamoyl Cyanide N&#8208;Oxides in Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides with tert&#8208;butyl nitrite produces novel sulfamoyl cyanide N&#8208;oxides which dimerize to form furoxanes. When the reaction is performed in the presence of a dipolarophile, an olefin or an alkyne, dipolar cycloaddition takes place to deliver isoxazolines or isoxazoles, respectively.
The versatility of diazo compounds in organic synthesis &#8211; whose reactivity could be realized in many ways, either with the loss or preservation of the dinitrogen moiety &#8211; continues to attract attention of numerous research teams around the world [1]. The design of each new type of diazo reagent usually opens the whole new area of research rich in novel reactivities discovered and molecular scaffolds synthesized [2].
In 2020, we described for the first time CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides 1 which we showed to be competent synthons for the preparation of pyrazoles 2 (via dipolar cycloaddition with alkynes or &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes)[3] and tetrazoles 3 (via silver&#8208;catalyzed dipolar cycloaddition with arene diazonium salts)[4] (Figure 1).</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Modular Assembly of Electrochemical Flow Microreactor as an Enabling Technology of Electrosynthesis in a Laminar Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow microreactors are well&#8208;suited for organic electrosynthesis because they provide a large surface area for reactions and enable precise control of the residence time. Here, we developed three novel electrochemical flow microreactors for organic electrosynthesis: undivided, divided, and electrophotochemical reactors. These flow reactors were easily assembled using modules made of solvent&#8208;resistant plastics and feature high interchangeability of each component and the applicability of a reference electrode. We evaluated our reactors on the basis of the redox response of ferrocene and ferrocenemethanol. The results suggested that the reactors maintain laminar flow with both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. We applied these reactors to paired electrosynthesis and electrophotocatalysis, demonstrating the utility of these systems for electrosynthesis in a laminar flow.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Catalyzed C&#8208;C Bond Formation for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysubstituted olefins as attractive and useful compounds are generally acquired by traditional acid or metal catalyzed system. Herein, a convenient and environmentally friendly method using acidic ionic liquids as a metal&#8208;free catalyst and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent has been demonstrated to synthesize polysubstituted olefins through construction of new C&#8208;C bonds by activating of ethers and alkenes. In the system, the usage of metal, halogen, traditional toxic solvents, and a large number of additives was avoided, neutralization after the reaction was not required, and waste production was reduced. The system was suitable for benzyl ethers and styrene derivatives, and recyclable [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf] exhibited best activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest synergistic functions of the cation and anion of ILs, and also show hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between catalyst and substrates, which can lead to lower barriers.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst&#8208;free tandem reaction was developed for the clean synthesis of spiro[2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;oxindole] derivatives from 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitriles and aldehydes in water. This method has an extensive substrate scope. The targeted products were easily isolated by filtration in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The reaction also features numerous advantages, including step/atom economy, both catalyst and additive&#8208;free, no organic solvents, simple work&#8208;up, short reaction times, and environmentally friendly conditions. The present strategy utilizes simple conditions, demonstrating the potential application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Sulfonamide as Hydrogen Bonding Catalyst in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Concept and Application in the Past Decade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the first report of bifunctional sulfonamide organocatalysts was launched in 2004, these chiral compounds have proven to be a reliable hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst and have been wildly employed in asymmetric organocatalysis due to its strong acidity and self&#8208;aggregation&#8208;free property. Herein, we review the application of bifunctional sulfonamide as hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst after 2011, and our highlights will cover asymmetric process including aldol reaction, Michael addition, Mannich reaction, desymmetrization and cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement of Indoles to Spirooxindoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.







Abstract
The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

         <title>Deoxygenative&#160;Chlorination of Aldehydes and Alcohols with Dichloromethyl Methyl Ether and TiCl4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report highly efficient deoxygenative chlorination of aldehydes and alcohols with a dichloromethyl methyl ether and TiCl  4  system. The method converts various aldehydes and alcohols into the desired geminal dichlorides or chlorides with good to excellent yields (up to 99%). Combined with a subsequent Rieche formylation step using the same reagent system, this method provides an efficient approach for synthesis of aromatic dialdehydes. This strategy involves deoxy&#8208;chlorination of the aryl aldehydes followed by a second formylation of more activated benzal chloride derivatives. Dialdehydes can be easily obtained by hydrolyzing the corresponding of dichloromethyl derivative.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycogen synthase kinase&#8208;3 &#945;/&#946; is involved in dysregulation of neuronal tau protein in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). There is an unmet clinical need for a blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) permeable positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging of GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in the brain to understand the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we synthesized two PET probes, [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE, and evaluated their BBB permeability and affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed higher in&#8208;vitro binding towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; (IC50 = 19.4 &#177; 2.5 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50 = 19.4 &#177; 3.8 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;) compared to [19F]F&#8208;CNBI (IC50 = 107.6 &#177; 26.0 nM; n=4, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50 = 105.3 &#177; 18.2 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;). [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed 9.5&#8208;fold higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI, in normal FVB/NJ mice, which was increased by additional 1.5&#8208;fold on co&#8208;administration of [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE with respect to [18F]F&#8208;CNBI. Overall, [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE is a promising PET probe for GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; imaging and warrants further evaluation in AD mouse model.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C Bond Formation Using Alkenes as Substrates: Insight into Recent Enantioselective Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

In all cases, the  trans  isomer was preferentially obtained. Sensitization and quenching experiments showed that the reaction proceeds via an excited singlet state. When a dichloromethane solution of  6  was irradiated for only 1 h, an eight&#8208;membered ring compound  8  was obtained as an intermediate. When the obtained  8  was irradiated, the final product  7  was produced. The long wavelength absorption of  6  originates from the 2&#8208;cyanonaphthalene chromophore, indicating that the reaction is initiated by photoexcitation of the naphthalene ring. In addition, the fluorescence of  6  was intramolecularly quenched, and a weak intramolecular exciplex emission was observed at 400&#8208;550 nm. In this reaction, after photoexcitation of  6  , a [2+2] photocycloadduct is formed at the 1,8a&#8208;position of the naphthalene ring via an intramolecular singlet exciplex, followed by thermal ring&#8208;opening and 4&#960; disrotatory ring&#8208;closure leads to  7  .</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Continuous&#8208;Flow Photo&#8208;Thiol&#8208;Ene Functionalization of Conformation&#8208;Controlled Cinchona Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Alkylation of Glycine Derivatives: A Straightforward Strategy for Diverse &#945;&#8208;Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of glycine is the one of the most straightforward strategy to access diverse unnatural amino acids. This review outlines an overview of recently developed transformations employing radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids are important scaffolds for novel drug candidates, and especially &#945;&#8208;alkyl amino acids have emerged as a valuable variant. This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products, biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical&#8208;based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site&#8208; and region&#8208;specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids via radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade's development of radical&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The advantages, current limitations, and perspectives of glycine&#8208;based unnatural amino acid synthesis are also discussed.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.

     alt="Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium-Assisted Allylic Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoichiometric Tsuji-Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd-dependent &#960;-inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tsuji-Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji-Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio- and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configured cyclopentenyl N9-linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd-dependent &#960;-inversion step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Allenes and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted cyclopropane products exhibiting a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms and a 2&#8208;aminoethyl side chain are regio&#8208; and stereoselectively accessible by titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation reactions of bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes. In addition, synthetically promising allylamines can be obtained from 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes under comparable reaction conditions.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140&#8201;&#176;C within 2&#8211;8&#8197;h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N&#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 and 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N&#8208;benzylanilines or N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The corresponding 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted (2&#8208;aminoethyl)cyclopropane products exhibit a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.
