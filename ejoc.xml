         <title>Double Porphyrin Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 7087-7100, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of double porphyrin cage compounds based on glycoluril is described. Through a multistep synthesis, three double cage compounds linked by spacers of variable length are obtained. The binding and conformational properties of their zinc derivatives towards the ditopic ligand dabco have been investigated into detail.






The synthesis and characterization of double porphyrin cage compounds are described. They consist of two porphyrins that are each attached to a diphenylglycoluril&#8208;based clip molecule via four ethyleneoxy spacers, and are linked together by a single alkyl chain using &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;chemistry. Following a newly developed multistep synthesis procedure we report three of these double porphyrin cages, linked by spacers of different lengths, i.e. 3, 5, and 11 carbon atoms. The structures of the double porphyrin cages were fully characterized by NMR, which revealed that they consist of mixtures of two diastereoisomers. Their zinc derivatives are capable of forming sandwich&#8208;like complexes with the ditopic ligand 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (dabco).

Studies on gold(III) coordination of a series of new chiral polydentate (X,)N,O&#8208;pyridine based ligands are reported. Successful coordination afforded novel chiral N,N,O&#8208;tridentate Au(III) complexes with the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;6&#8208;[(1S,2S,5R)&#8208;neomenthol&#8208;1&#8208;yl]pyridine ligand (1H, 13C, 15N NMR, HRMS, IR, XRD). The chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;6&#8208;alkylpyridine alcohol ligands were prepared from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine, (&#8211;)&#8208;menthone or (+)&#8208;camphor, and arylboronic acids. The new N,N,O&#8208;ligated gold(III) complex was highly catalytic active and outperformed AuCl3 in a cyclopropanation test reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6997-7014, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroaminoalkylation reactions of ortho&#8208;chlorostyrenes with various secondary amines deliver the linear addition products with high regioselectivity. A combination of this reaction with a subsequent intramolecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination creates a new and simple two&#8208;step procedure that gives direct access to pharmacologically important 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines.






A new two&#8208;step procedure that includes an initial regioselective intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of ortho&#8208;chlorostyrenes with N&#8208;methylanilines and a subsequent intramolecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination gives direct access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. The hydroaminoalkylation reaction of the ortho&#8208;chlorostyrenes is catalyzed by a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium complex which delivers the linear regioisomers with high selectivities. In addition, the formation of unexpected dihydroaminoalkylation products from styrenes and N&#8208;methylanilines is reported.

Synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylthio)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ols has been achieved through a catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridinium bromides with sodium arenesulfinates. The tandem reaction involved intramolecular amidation followed by sulfenylation and afforded a wide range of 3&#8208;(arylthio)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ols in moderate to excellent (33&#8211;85&#8201;%) yields. The method exhibited broad substrate scope with a wide range of functional group tolerance, and is amenable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Shining Light on TiIV Complexes: Exceptional Tools for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6955-6965, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallaphotoredox catalysis is emerging as an excellent and versatile cornerstone for the development of modern synthetic methodologies. Recent examples have displayed how the redox chemistry of titanium&#8208;based complexes can be triggered by organic and inorganic chromophores in catalytic processes activated by visible&#8208;light, affording synthetically demanding products.






Titanium is one of the most abundant and environmentally innocuous metals. Ti&#8208;based organometallic compounds have long been used as versatile homogeneous catalysts in synthetic chemistry and still remain highly attractive for the development of sustainable transformations. With the emerging role of photoredox catalysis, the selectivity of the radical initiation in electron transfer&#8208;mediated reactions has been shown to be fundamental in terms of synthesis efficiency. Recent examples have displayed the effectiveness of inorganic and organic chromophores at the excited state in triggering the redox chemistry of TiIV/III complexes. In this minireview, we will illustrate the underlying principles and practicability of these &#8211; still uncommon &#8211; metallaphotoredox catalytic reactions.

         <title>On the Regioselectivity of the Gould&#8211;Jacobs Reaction: Gas&#8208;Phase Versus Solution&#8208;Phase Thermolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 7051-7061, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselectivity of the Gould&#8211;Jacobs reaction of (pyridyl)aminomethylenemalonates can be controlled either in favor of the kinetic (pyridopyrimidinone) or the thermodynamic (naphthyridinone) product, depending on the position of the substituent in the pyridine moiety and the applied thermolysis technique.






A detailed investigation of the regioselectivity in the thermal cyclization of (pyridyl)aminomethylenemalonates both in the gas&#8208; and solution phase is presented. Flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) as a gas&#8208;phase thermolysis technique is used to study the Gould&#8211;Jacobs reaction at temperatures between 450&#8211;650 &#176;C, while different solution&#8208;phase heating techniques (reflux, microwave, and continuous flow) were employed at 260&#8211;350 &#176;C. Depending on the position of the substituent in the pyridine moiety and the applied thermolysis technique, the regioselectivity of the cyclization can be controlled either in favor of the kinetic (pyridopyrimidinone) or the thermodynamic (naphthyridinone) product. Under FVP conditions, 6&#8208;substituted pyridopyrimidinones were obtained in high regioselectivity, which was not demonstrated before under standard Gould&#8211;Jacobs reaction conditions. DFT calculations have been additionally performed to provide further insights into the mechanistic pathways of this specific Gould&#8211;Jacobs reaction.

         <title>Front Cover: Synthesis of Peptido RNAs from Unprotected Peptides and Oligoribonucleotides via Coupling in Aqueous Solution (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 45/2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6941-6941, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the structure of a peptido RNA that was prepared in NMR quantities from a peptide and an oligoribonucleotide in aqueous solution, without the need for protecting groups. The two&#8208;step protocol starts with conversion of the 5'&#8208;terminal phosphate of the RNA to an imidazolide, followed by 1&#8208;ethylimidazole&#8208;catalyzed coupling at pH 8 that produces the phosphoramidate&#8208;linked final product. The method opens the door to the systematic investigation of molecular hybrids implicated in the origin of RNA&#8208;directed protein synthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Richert et al.

         <title>Complexes Formed between Artificial Receptors and &#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside in the Crystalline State</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 7023-7034, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed analyses of the binding modes observed in the crystalline complexes of artificial receptors and &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside provide deeper insights into the phenomena of molecular recognition of carbohydrates and show their remarkable similarity to those used by carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins. Remarkably, each of the three crystal structures discussed in this paper is characterized by the presence of two types of receptor&#8208;sugar complexes.






In contrast to numerous known crystal structures of protein&#8208;carbohydrate complexes, which act as a source of structural information about carbohydrate&#8208;mediated recognition processes, there are only individual literature reports on crystal structures of complexes formed between artificial receptors and sugars. In this context, the new crystalline complexes of acyclic receptors and &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside described in this article provide particularly valuable model systems to study the basic molecular features of carbohydrate recognition. The detailed analyses of the binding modes observed in these complexes have shown their remarkable similarity to those used by carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins. It is noteworthy that many of the basic molecular features of protein&#8208;carbohydrate interactions, that have been summarized years ago in some literature reports, apply to interactions observed in complexes formed by the artificial receptors.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Fluoroalkyltelluryl&#8208;Substituted Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6943-6954, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
CF3O, CF3S, and CF3Se chemistries have been widely described in the last years. Tellurium is the following chalcogen but the CF3Te chemistry remains poorly described. This review presents the different strategies and methods currently available.






Fluorinated substituents confer specific properties to molecules. In the last years, the merging of chalcogenes with trifluoromethyl or fluoroalkyl moieties has known a growing interest. However, the last non&#8208;radioactive family member, namely tellurium, did not receive much attention. This review will present and discuss the state of the art chemistry of RFTe, to describe the available methods and highlight the future developments to consider.

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6992-6996, December 7, 2020. </description>

Silk fibroin&#8208;supported Pd catalyst (Pd/SF) has been prepared and tested in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, showing better activity, wide substrate scope and high recyclability compared to other biopolymer&#8208;supported palladium catalysts.






Silk fibroin supported Pd (Pd/SF) has been prepared and used as catalyst in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water/ethanol (4:1 v/v) mixture. The reactions proceed rapidly with aryl iodides and boronic acids with different electronic properties using low metal loading (0.38 mol&#8208;%). Pd/SF exhibits better recyclability compared to other biopolymer&#8208;supported Pd catalysts, up to nineteen cycles without loss of activity.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Synthesis of Benzodithiophene Derivatives and Study of their Optical and Electrochemical Performance</title>

Valuable &#960;&#8208;conjugated benzodithiophene derivatives have been prepared through a ligand&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, under mild aerobic conditions, in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as environmentally responsible reaction media, and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated.






We report that dihalogeno&#8208;substituted benzodithiophenes (BDTs) undergo a smooth ligand&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, under air and moderate heating (60 &#176;C), with aryl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208; and alkynyltrifluoroborate salts in a biodegradable choline chloride&#8208;based eutectic mixture, thereby granting access to valuable &#960;&#8208;conjugated BDT compounds (up to 79&#8201;% yield), which are gaining great interest in the field of material sciences. The optical and electrochemical properties of these systems have been thoroughly investigated by means of absorption and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The first electrooligomerization study of a representative BDT derivative has also been undertaken.

         <title>Synthesis of Peptido RNAs from Unprotected Peptides and Oligoribonucleotides via Coupling in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6966-6975, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptido RNAs are a novel class of hybrid molecules that form in spontaneous reactions of amino acids and nucleotides in condensation buffer. A convenient method for accessing such species in monodisperse form from unprotected peptides and 5'&#8208;phosphorylated oligoribonucleotides in aqueous solution was developed. It uses a two&#8208;step protocol of activation and organocatalytic coupling.






Peptido RNAs are hybrid molecules with a phosphoramidate link between the N&#8208;terminus of a peptide and the 5'&#8208;phosphate of an oligoribonucleotide. Such species are formed in spontaneous co&#8208;oligomerizations of amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. To shed light on the properties of these fascinating molecules, a synthetic method for their preparation in monodisperse form is needed. Herein, we report how peptido RNAs can be prepared via solution&#8208;phase coupling of unprotected peptides and oligoribonucleotides in aqueous solution. The preferred protocol uses pre&#8208;activation of the 5'&#8208;phosphate of the RNA as an imidazolide at pH 6.5, followed by precipitation and coupling to the peptide at pH 8 with an organocatalyst. The procedure gave peptido RNAs from water&#8208;soluble peptides and synthetic oligoribonucleotides in up to 68&#8201;% yield. The method is convenient and inexpensive and can produce NMR quantities, opening the door to the systematic exploration of the chemistry of peptido RNAs.

         <title>Linear Coumarinacenes Beyond Benzo[g]coumarins: Synthesis and Promising Characteristics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6976-6980, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linearly &#960;&#8208;expanded coumarins beyond benzo[g]coumarins, named coumarinacenes, have been successfully synthesized for the first time. They reveal exciting visible absorption and bright orange&#8208;red emission. They exhibit high thermal, photochemical and air stabilities. Such linear &#960;&#8208;expansion indeed profits coumarin with encouraging charge transport characteristics and good device stability.






New heteroacenes, named coumarinacenes, have been designed, synthesized and characterized. They possess visible absorption and orange&#8208;red emission that are far beyond those of benzo[g]coumarins. They exhibit deep HOMO energy levels, and reveal excellent thermal, photochemical and air stabilities as compared to tetracene/pentacene.

&lt;p&gt;Linearly &#960;&#8208;expanded coumarins beyond benzo[&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]coumarins, named coumarinacenes, have been successfully synthesized for the first time. They reveal exciting visible absorption and bright orange&#8208;red emission. They exhibit high thermal, photochemical and air stabilities. Such linear &#960;&#8208;expansion indeed profits coumarin with encouraging charge transport characteristics and good device stability.

         <title>Biosynthetically Relevant Reactivity of Polyneuridine Aldehyde</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 6989-6991, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of polyneuridine aldehyde, the first biosynthetic member of the sarpagan&#8208;type alkaloids, was studied. Retro&#8208;biomimetic formation of corynan&#8208;type alkaloids (e.g. geissoschizine) and the biomimetic formation of quebrachidine, the first biosynthetic parent of the ajamalan&#8208;type alkaloids were performed. In addition, an unusual intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene&#8208;reaction involving the indole nucleus delivered an original polycyclic scaffold.






Polyneuridine aldehyde is a key intermediate in the biosynthetic routes of monoterpene indole alkaloids family of natural products. The molecule is the first biosynthetic member of the sarpagan&#8208;type alkaloids and is an entry to the ajmalan&#8208;type and alstophyllan&#8208;type alkaloids. Complementary to the recent description of polyneuridine aldehyde, its reactivity was studied. Retro&#8208;biomimetic formation of corynan&#8208;type alkaloids (e.g., geissoschizine) and the biomimetic formation of quebrachidine, the first biosynthetic parent of the ajamalan&#8208;type alkaloids, were performed.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Heterocycles from Aryldiazoacetates**</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 7069-7078, December 7, 2020. </description>

Microwave&#8208;superheated solutions of aryldiazoacetates and 1,2&#8208;diamines mixed in toluene yield rapid access to quinoxalinones and quinoxalines without the use of catalysts, additives or otherwise complicated reaction conditions.






Herein, we describe a rapid microwave&#8208;assisted, metal&#8208;free synthesis of substituted quinoxalinones and quinoxalines using the carbene&#8208;mediated reaction between aryldiazo esters and 1,2&#8208;diamines. The reaction can encompass a range of substituents and structural variations to afford quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% yield and corresponding quinoxalines in good to excellent yields upon oxidation (67&#8211;96&#8201;%). The approach can be employed to generate symmetrical and unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diarylquinoxalines, bis&#8208;quinoxalines as well as novel quinoxaline&#8208;substituted diazo esters and should be a valuable addition to the heterocycle synthesis toolbox.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Mediated Radiofluorination of Aryl Pinacolboronate Esters: Alcohols as Solvents with Application to 6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2020, Issue 45, Page 7079-7086, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the possibility of an effective copper&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of aryl pinacoloboronate esters is demonstrated for the first time, on the example of a precursor for 6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA in neat alcohol, using the neutral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst tetrabutyl ammonium triflate.






Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of arylboronic acid pinacol esters (ArylBPin) using Cu(OTf)2(Py)4 complex is a useful approach for the introduction of [18F]fluorine into non&#8208;activated arenes and heteroarenes. Owing to the complexity of the mechanism and wide variation in substrate reactivity the choice of reaction conditions must be made individually for every precursor. Careful selection of phase&#8208;transfer catalysts also plays a role, as Cu&#8208;catalyst and ArylBPin precursors are known to be unstable in basic conditions. Using tetrabutylammonium triflate alcohol solution for elution of [18F]fluoride from ion&#8208;exchange cartridge and employing same alcohol as a co&#8208;solvent in the following labelling step, we have developed a general protocol resulting in &gt;80&#8201;% fluorination efficiency of ArylBPin precursors for 4&#8208;[18F]fluoro&#8208;D,L&#8208;phenylalanine and 6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA. Radiofluorination in neat alcohol was particularly effective for the synthesis of 6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA, allowing for substantial increase of yield and decrease of synthesis time compared to current methods (activity yield 14.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5&#8201;%, 70 min synthesis time).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition involving non&#8208;stabilized electron&#8208;rich azomethine ylides and diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridones bearing two potential C=C dipolarophilic sites. The 1,3&#8208;dipoles were prepared in situ under TFA catalysis and cycloadditions were studied according to the nature of the pyridones and position of the various substituents. These reactions occur under mild conditions, and lead to the expected cycloadducts in good yields and full control of the regioselectivity. Furthermore, mono&#8208; or biscycloadditions were performed, leading to the formation of polycyclic scaffolds bearing biologically relevant pyrrolidine rings prevalent in natural products. The diastereoselectivity of the second cycloaddition was fully controlled by the first addition, leading to heterocycles with a trans relative stereochemistry of the two generated rings in the final tricyclo&#8208;adduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation, characterization and reactivity of aliphatic amino iodane(III) reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of a new class of aliphatic amino iodane(III) reagents has been realized with the N&#8208;TMS&#8208;amine and acetoxybenziodazole participated in the formation of N&#8208;I bond. The amino&#8208;containing iodane(III) reagent 2d was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which revealed the expected hypervalent iodane distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. A practical copper&#8208;catalyzed, directed electrophilic amination of aryl amines employing amino&#8208;iodane(III) as amination agents was disclosed that proceeded smoothly without external additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Processes of Arynes Reacting with Three Classes of Nucleophiles for Organic Syntheses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic application of arynes is broadened by their reactions with neutral  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;, and  O  &#8208;containing nucleophiles to produce three types of compounds. Accordingly, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines are synthesized from Schiff bases, alkynes, and arynes through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Epoxides are prepared from thioethers and arynes along with aldehydes or ketones through a Johnson&#8208;Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky reaction. Phenolic ethers are produced from allyl ethers and arynes through a Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement. These target molecules, including natural products &#947;&#8208;asarone, asaricin, and a cholesteryl phenolic ether, are formed through reactions initiated by arynes. These new reactions share a prevailing feature of domino processes, which are carried out in a single flask and afford the desired products in good to high yields  .</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Thiol&#8211;Ene Click Protocol Using Benzil as Sensitizer and White LED as Light Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced photo&#8208;sensitized reactions of alkenes and alkynes with thiols to form thioethers are described. High selectivity with large functional group compatibility for aromatic as well as aliphatic alkenes is also demonstrated.






The thiol&#8211;ene reaction leading to a series of thioether derivatives by simple metal and oxidant free visible light promoted photosensitized protocol, following anti&#8208;Markonikov hydrothiolation of unactivated aryl and alkyl olefins at room temperature is demonstrated. Benzil served as a green photosensitizer in this reaction and white LED lights as a light source. This radical based thiol&#8211;ene reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups present in olefins.

         <title>SNAr Reaction toward the Synthesis of Fluorinated Quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intramolecular S  N  Ar displacement of the  o  &#8208;fluorine atom of a  meso  &#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin metal complex by a neighboring &#946;&#8208;amino functionality generated the corresponding  meso  &#8208;fluorophenyl&#8208;substituted quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrin com&#173;plexes that are not accessible using established quinoline&#8208;annulation methodologies. The Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) complexes of the quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrin were thus prepared. The parent free base quinolino[2,3,4&#8208;at]porphyrin is accessible only by demetallation of the copper or zinc complex. A strong through&#8208;space NMR&#8208;spectroscopic coupling between the remaining  o  &#8208;fluorine atoms on the annulated  meso  &#8208;aryl group and the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom on the adjacent pyrrole moiety provide a clear indication for the annulation. Quinoline&#8208;annulation alters the optical properties significantly. On account of the presence of the &#946;&#8208;amino functionality, all quinoline&#8208;annulated porphyrins show strong halochromic responses with Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, the prerequisite for their potential use in chemosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>N 1&#8208; and N3&#8208;Arylations of Hydantoins Employing Diaryliodonium Salts via Copper(I) Catalysis at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation (both N1&#8208; and N3&#8208;) of hydantoins with diaryliodonium salts as aryl partners at room temperature is reported. The transformation allows diverse scopes on both hydantoins and diaryliodonium salts delivering functionalized N3&#8208;arylated products under mild reaction conditions. The presence of hydrogens at C5&#8208; and N1&#8208; position of the hydantoin does not lead to other side products. Chiral hydantoins can also be synthesised via this methodology. Sterically&#8208;complicated ortho&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts are tolerated and delivered challenging ortho&#8208;arylated products. In addition, this strategy can also be effectively extended to N1&#8208;arylation of hydantoins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ethanol is typically used in organic synthesis as an environmentally benign solvent. Herein, we wish to report a mild and efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of N&#8208;heteroarenes with cyclic ethers by uncovering the new reactivity of ethanol as an efficient promoter in PIFA&#8208;mediated radical process. The reaction proceeds smoothly under the irradiation of visible light and features excellent functional group compatibility, which allows the expedite synthesis of a variety of medicinally valuable C  &#945;  &#8208;heteroarylated cyclic ethers in moderate to high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Nucleobase di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalized Porphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of nucleobase&#8208;functionalized porphyrins was achieved  via  two strategies: substitution and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Following the first strategy resulted in four porphyrins having two nucleobases at the&#160;  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by flexible methylene linkers. In order to synthesize the targeted molecules, 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin) was reacted with thymine, cytosine, adenine and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine, a precursor of guanine, in the presence of a suitable base. Thymine and cytosine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N1 site, whereas adenine and amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloropurine were introduced to the porphyrin&#160; on their N9 site. The synthesis of a porphyrin bearing four thymine moieties at its four  meso&#8208;  positions is also described. &#160;Furthermore, following the Sonogashira cross coupling reaction strategy led to the formation of&#160; four new porphyrins bearing two NBs in  trans  positions. Ethynyl&#8208;substituted nucleobases were reacted with 5,15&#8208;dibromo&#8208;10,20&#8208;dipentylporphyrin under sonogashira cross coupling conditions to result in four rigid porphyrins having two nucleobases at the  trans meso  &#8208;positions linked by rigid ethynyl linkers.&#160; All the tectons have been characterized and could be used in the formation of molecular H&#8208;bonded networks. The porphyrin bearing cytosine via ethynyl linkers self&#8208;assembled into a 2D hydrogen bonded network formed by the complementary interactions between the cytosine moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Prins cyclization versus tandem Prins processes for the synthesis of hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]chromene skeleton</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose the synthesis of biologically relevant hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrano[3,4&#8208;c  ]chromenes,  via  a tandem Prins/Friedels&#8208;Crafts process, catalysed by BF3  .Et2O, starting from (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;phenoxypent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol. The diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the geometry of the homoallylic alcohol. We also point out that the Prins product can be obtained in high yields and good diastereoselectivity when the reaction is promoted by AlCl3  as Lewis acid in the presence of an external nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarbonylative Issues Involved in Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed [6+2&#8208;1] Annulation Reaction of Hydroxychromone with Alkyne: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density functional theory calculations have been performed to explore the Ru&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative annulation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;chromone with alkyne to synthesize spiro&#8208;indenebenzofuranones. A Ru(II)&#8208;Ru(0)&#8208;Ru(II) rather than a Ru(II)&#8208;Ru(IV)&#8208;Ru(II) transformation was found involved in the decarbonylation process, which is responsible for the sequence of alkyne insertion/decarbonylation. Oxidative addition of C(carbonyl)&#8208;C(carbonyl) bond to Ru(0) and the Ru(II)&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond formation were confirmed to be favorable for the decarbonylation, meanwhile oxidative addition of C(carbonyl)&#8208;C(carbonyl) bond to Ru(0) is likely to be the rate&#8208;determining step for the entire catalytic cycle. It is predicted that regeneration of the catalyst was achieved by the oxidation of air oxygen in the absence of other oxidants. The current theoretical study provides the new insights into the decarbonylative annulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of lipophilicity on the activity of hexameric cyclic peptoid ion carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two families of hexameric cyclic peptoids decorated with linear  N  &#8208;alkyl and alternated  N  &#8208;alkyl/  N  &#8208;benzyl side chains (  2a&#8208;d  and  3a&#8208;c  , respectively) were designed and synthesized in order to correlate their logP values (from 2.55 to 6.83) to their ionophoric activities. The present contribution confirms the general ability of hexameric cyclic peptoids to behave as efficient cation carriers, corroborates their preference for Na  +  ion, among the tested alkali metals, and suggests a Na  +  /H  +  antiport transport mechanism (rate limited by the transport of the proton) for these new ionophores. Our observations indicate that in order to attain an efficient ionophoric activity, a narrow range of liphophilicity is required (4&lt; logP &lt; 5). Moreover, to gain information on the solid state stucture of ionophoric cyclic peptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains,&#160;X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies were performed on exemplar compound  2a  . Crystal structure of compound  2a  confirms the tendency of ionophoric cyclopeptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains to form layered assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene] Derivatives as Precursors of Electrodeposited Regioregular Thiophene&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of conjugation extended push&#8208;pull derivatives of 4,4'&#8208;spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;  b  :3,4&#8208;  b  ']dithiophene] were synthesized and fully characterized, in which each perpendicularly aligned cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;  b  :3,4&#8208;  b  ']dithiophene features a pendant dicyanovinylene as an electron acceptor and a thiophene as an electron donor.

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Osmium&#8208;Free Olefin syn&#8208;Dihydroxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols are valuable scaffolds for building a vast number of biologically active compounds and are also important synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. This review focuses on a concise summary of the main metal&#8208;catalyzed methods of olefin syn&#8208;dihydroxylation developed over the past ten years to circumvent the use of osmium.






The syn&#8208;dihydroxylation of olefinic group is one of the most important synthetic transformations which leads to the controlled formation of syn&#8208;diol. Such 1,2&#8208;diol structure is integrated into more complex architectures and substantially participates in the development of biologically active molecules and other fine chemicals. This minireview describes recent evolution of this research field in the past decade, surveying osmium&#8208;free and more eco&#8208;compatible system and in particular the direct oxidation of olefins catalyzed by transition metal complexes.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Thiopyrans via thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Photochemically Generated Thioaldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyrans are important structural motifs both in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. A continuous flow&#8208;process for the photochemical generation of thioaldehydes from phenacyl sulfides and the ensuing [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;dienes was developed. The cycloadducts were obtained with excellent yields in short reaction times and much improved productivities as compared to classical batch reactions.






Herein, we report a novel protocol for the photochemical generation of thioaldehydes in a continuous flow process which were in situ reacted with electron rich 1,3&#8208;butadienes in thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. A broad range of 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyrans were formed as products in much higher yields and productivities as compared to classical batch processes. Moreover, greatly reduced reaction times and a facile large&#8208;scale preparation of products were achieved by fully exploiting the advantages of continuous flow technology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Tris&#8208;Primary Amine Based Organic Imine Cages and Related Amine Macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular integration of Tris&#8208;primary amine moiety and multiple aldehyde centers often leads to organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles which demand commendable position in the field of material science and supramolecular chemistry. In this review we highlighted recent studies regarding the synthesis and special features of such OICs and their saturated counterparts.






Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the field of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science. In this review we aimed to consider recent reports that highlighted the syntheses, special features, and applications of primary triamine based OICs and related amine macrocycles.

         <title>Metal&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free, One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 3&#8208;Unsubstituted Benzoindolizines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines from readily available (iso)quinolines and propiolates is presented. Employing solvent&#8208;free conditions, the competitive cyclization into 1,2&#8208;disubstituted indolizines was suppressed, allowing remarkable chemoselectivity towards the synthetically valuable C1 mono&#8208;substituted indolizines.






A simple one&#8208;pot, solvent&#8208;free method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines is presented. Conversely to the output from standard classical cycloaddition approaches, an unconventional connectivity is achieved with excellent chemoselectivity under neat conditions without requiring any metal catalyst or additional additive. Hence, various abundant (iso)quinolines and propiolic esters were transformed into the corresponding benzoindolizines in synthetically useful yields. This straightforward and simplistic transformation expands the synthetic tool kit for the preparation of valuable 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines, which have been shown to be highly versatile synthetic intermediates with a broad bioactivity spectrum.

         <title>Chitosan&#8208;Silicon Phthalocyanine Conjugate as Effective Photo&#8208;Functional Hydrogel for Tracking and Killing of Bacteria</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of four&#8208;armed water soluble phthalocyanine derivative, that was conjugated to chitosan through carbodiimide&#8208;mediated amine coupling reaction, resulting in the formation of photoactive hydrogel in described.






Hydrogels are attractive materials for many biomedical applications, including drug delivery and wound healing. A light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity can be conferred to the material with the introduction of appropriate photosensitizers (PS). In this study, we have synthesized water&#8208;soluble silicon(IV)phthalocyanine derivative (SiPc) that contains four carboxylic groups on the periphery of the macrocycle. Obtained PS serves not only as an active chromophore but also as a cross&#8208;linking gelator, enabling simple and easy synthesis of chitosan conjugate (SiPcCh). Although UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic methods showed that both free and conjugated PS are non&#8208;aggregated in water media, only SiPcCh possess remarkable antibacterial effect against Gram&#8208;positive B. subtilis and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access towards 4,5&#8208;Disubstituted 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazoles Starting from Mannich Substrates and their Transformation Utilities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot process towards C4/C5&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole structures starting from the corresponding Mannich&#8208;type substrates. The IBX/IPT&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative annulation and hydroxylamine&#8208;induced ring cleavage sequence were carried out under mild conditions affording the desired heterocycles in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Further modifications were also executed including GBB&#8208;3CR and preparation of structurally modified marine alkaloid analogs.






An efficient protocol for the preparation of 4,5&#8208;functionalised 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazoles as fragment&#8208;like structures was developed in isolated yields up to 95&#8201;%. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot manner includes an intramolecular oxidative annulation and ring cleavage sequence starting from Mannich precursors. The suggested one&#8208;pot sequential synthetic methodology is easy to apply in automatic and robotic chemistry laboratories for which a rapidly increasing demand is foreseen because of the ongoing revolution in the field of continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical drug substances and products. Further transformation utilities such as Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; 3CR and the formation of marine alkaloid analogs were also represented.

     alt="One&#8208;Pot Access towards 4,5&#8208;Disubstituted 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazoles Starting from Mannich Substrates and their Transformation Utilities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot process towards C4/C5&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;imidazole structures starting from the corresponding Mannich&#8208;type substrates. The IBX/IPT&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative annulation and hydroxylamine&#8208;induced ring cleavage sequence were carried out under mild conditions affording the desired heterocycles in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Further modifications were also executed including GBB&#8208;3CR and preparation of structurally modified marine alkaloid analogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient protocol for the preparation of 4,5&#8208;functionalised 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;imidazoles as fragment&#8208;like structures was developed in isolated yields up to 95&#8201;%. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot manner includes an intramolecular oxidative annulation and ring cleavage sequence starting from Mannich precursors. The suggested one&#8208;pot sequential synthetic methodology is easy to apply in automatic and robotic chemistry laboratories for which a rapidly increasing demand is foreseen because of the ongoing revolution in the field of continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical drug substances and products. Further transformation utilities such as Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; 3CR and the formation of marine alkaloid analogs were also represented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unexpected ring opening during the imination of camphor&#8208;type bicyclic ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new ring opening reaction was found while attempting to isolate the imines from  ortho  &#8208;heteroatom substituted anilines and camphor&#8208;like bicyclic ketones. The benzoazoles containing a cyclopentanemethyl group at position 2 of the heterocycle were isolated instead of the expected imines. The detailed study of the transformation, including EPR experiments, revealed the most probable radical mechanism. The proposed reaction pathways were confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The dichotomy of 1&#8209;2 and 2&#8209;3 bonds cleavage is discussed together with the evaluation of the stereochemical outcome of the reactions. The benzoazoles obtained via the new reaction are of particular interest for the medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fungicide precursor racemization kinetics for deracemization in complex systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the racemization area, the keto&#8208;enol equilibrium is a major player when it comes to racemizing &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The racemization kinetics in the co&#8208;crystal induced deracemization of a fungicide precursor is complex as next to the racemization catalyst, which is a base, an acidic co&#8208;former is used to ensure the crystallization of the co&#8208;crystal. Here we show that understanding of the racemization kinetics of the target compound is of key importance for optimization of the co&#8208;crystallization based deracemization process. The racemization rates in solution as a function of solvent and base concentration were determined by measuring the decreasing enrichment of the chiral ketone due to racemization over time, using a polarimeter set&#8208;up with a continuous recycling loop through the polarimeter cell. The established racemization kinetics model aligns with the experimental data giving access to the intrinsic racemization rate constant. The proposed mechanism is first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess of the target compound and the base&#8208;catalyst concentration. The solvent is shown to affect the racemization constant, with protic solvents increasing this rate substantially. Finally, we observed the presence of the chiral acid co&#8208;former to alter the reaction mechanism albeit remaining first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess. Though more complex, the mechanism still followed Arrhenius law, providing key information on the impact of temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;connected 2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)aldehydes for the design of UV&#8208;responsive functional molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use click chemistry to functionalize simple lipophilic and water&#8208;soluble molecules, a complex PEGylated phospholipid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000), and two benzylic substrates with the 2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)aldehyde (HIA) group. To this end, we synthesize two terminal alkynes bearing the HIA moiety and we couple them to different azides through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Norrish&#8208;Yang photoisomerization (&#955;= 365 nm, LED source) is successfully obtained, with no interference by the triazole linker, except when the forbidden  n&#8208;&#960;*  carbonyl transition is screened by a remote substituent such as salicylaldehyde. UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry suggests a specific interaction of HIAs with Cu(II), whereas no such evidence is found with Cu(I). We thereby show that the CuAAC methodology can be used successfully to obtain HIA&#8208;based UV&#8208;responsive hydrophilic or lipophilic ligands, phospholipidic components for the construction of liposomes, and macrocycle precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Aryl Selenides and Tellurides via Visible Light&#8208;Driven Activation of Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical (hetero)aryl selenides and tellurides have been prepared in satisfactory yields from arylazo sulfones under visible light driven, photocatalyst&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions.






A protocol for the visible light driven preparation of unsymmetrical (hetero)aryl selenides and tellurides is described herein. The method exploits the peculiar photoreactivity of arylazo sulfones that act as thermally stable, precursors of aryl radicals under both photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The method developed shows an impressive versatility (more than fifty compounds isolated).

         <title>Syntheses and Applications of Spirocyclopropyl Oxindoles: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclopropyl oxindole comprising spiro&#8208;fusion of 2&#8208;oxindole with cyclopropane unit is a versatile organic framework. The present review highlights the detailed chemistry of spirocyclopropyl oxindole core. Various synthetic approaches to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been discussed followed by their applications in ring&#8208;opening/expansion reactions.






Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulfur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Selective and Diverse Synthesis of Three Distinct Sets of Isoindolinones from 2&#8208;Alkynylbenzoic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;free selective and diverse synthesis of three distinct sets of isoindolinones from 2&#8208;alkynylbenzoic acids and amines in a controlled manner is reported. This process features metal free, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, good to high yields, good functional group tolerance, simple operation, high bond&#8208;forming efficiency, and step economy.






The metal&#8208;free selective and diverse synthesis of three distinct sets of isoindolinones from 2&#8208;alkynylbenzoic acids and amines has been achieved in a reaction&#8208;condition&#8208;controlled manner. This method exhibits valuable advantageous features such as available starting materials, broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, good to high yields, good functional group tolerance, simple operation, high bond&#8208;forming efficiency, and step economy, thus providing a convenient and efficient access to a variety of heterocyclic compounds incorporating the bioactive isoindolinone motif.

         <title>Multivalent 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Linked Carbohydrate Mimetics by Huisgen&#8211;Meldal&#8208;Sharpless Cycloadditions of an Azidopyran</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azidopyran was coupled through a CuAAC reaction with oligoalkynes to provide multivalent carbohydrate mimetics with flexible or rigid core elements. Preliminary SPR measurements indicate that an O&#8208;sulfated C60&#8208;derived dodecavalent compound may be an excellent ligand of L&#8208; and P&#8208;selectins (IC50 values in low nM range).






Starting from an enantiopure 3&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted pyran derivative and various oligo&#8208;alkynes a series of multivalent 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked carbohydrate mimetics was synthesized. The copper&#8208;catalyzed Huisgen&#8211;Meldal&#8208;Sharpless cycloaddition (CuAAC) served as key coupling reaction. Cu/C in the presence of triethylamine proved to be a good catalytic system in most cases. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, and octavalent compounds with typical rigid or flexible core units were prepared. The most complex compound contains a C60&#8208;fullerene center leading to a dodecavalent carbohydrate mimetic. Only a few of the multivalent target compounds could be converted into pure O&#8208;sulfated derivatives that are required for their evaluation as L&#8208; and P&#8208;selectin ligands. Nevertheless, preliminary experiments suggest that the dodecavalent C60&#8208;derived compound may be a promising ligand of these biologically important proteins with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range.

         <title>Front Cover: Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a crossroad, metaphorically representing the possibility of a phenol to be oxidized to an ortho&#8208; or a para&#8208;quinone depending on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs &#955;5&#8208;iodane). However, things are not so straightforward, since prototropic equilibria and valence tautomerization can provide a diversion from the selected pathway. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#160;Caprioglio, G.&#160;Appendino et al.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a conceptual illustration of molecular systems that can be activated by orthogonal stimuli to show multimodal movement. Integration of distinct mechanically active components would be a promising strategy to design molecular machines capable of executing sophisticated tasks. However, a key consideration is how to ensure selective operation of the individual components. In this regard, a variety of ingenious examples of molecular switches and motors powered by different stimuli to exhibit multiple dynamic features have been reported. More information can be found in the Minireview by S. Kwon et al.

         <title>Photoinduced decarboxylative radical addition reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of peptide substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Here, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.</dc:description>

         <title>8&#8208;Prenylflavanones through Microwave Promoted Tandem Claisen Rearrangement/6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig Cyclization and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave irradiation of ortho&#8208;allyloxy chalcones promotes a tandem sequence of Claisen rearrangement and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig&#8208;cyclization. Olefin cross metathesis then furnishes prenylated flavonoids. The method has, inter alia, been applied to the synthesis of an angular chromene&#8208;annellated natural product and its linear isomer. Both occur in medicinal plants indigenous in India and Nigeria respectively.






Prenylated flavanones were obtained from ortho&#8208;allyloxy chalcones through a one&#8208;pot sequence of Claisen rearrangement and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, followed by olefin cross metathesis of the intermediate allyl flavanones with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene. The synthetic utility of this route is illustrated for the synthesis of several naturally occurring prenyl flavanones.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Controlled Reductive Amination Reactions with NaBH4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NaBH4 was controlled by atmospheric CO2, thus suppressing direct reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. High selectivities towards reductive amination alkylation reactions indicate the in&#8208;situ formation of less reducing NaBH(OCHO)3. This protocol provides a surrogate for conventional reducing reagents in reductive amination reactions.






We report the use of CO2 to curb the reactivity of NaBH4 enabling its use in reductive amination reactions. CO2 readily reacts with NaBH4 to decrease its capacity to reduce aldehydes to alcohols while remaining able to reduce imines and iminium ions for desired alkylation reactions. The formation of NaBH(OCHO)3 as a reducing reagent was critical to achieve the desired selectivity. A general protocol was established for C&#8211;N bond formation reactions and replacing NaBH4 with NaBD4 allowed for reductive amination with concomitant deuteration to be carried out.

         <title>When Indoles Meet Allene and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview follows the story from the time when indole and allene first met in a metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition in the second half of the 2000s, through 15 years of encounters under diverse reaction conditions, in which a fruitful relationship has allowed the synthesis of more complex products and revealed new exciting mechanistic pathways.






The allene functional group and the indole ring have emerged as recurring building blocks in organic chemistry due to their diverse reactivity and straightforward preparation. In addition, the biological properties and natural occurrence of indole give a remarkable added&#8208;value to newly&#8208;prepared indole&#8208;based structures. In the last decade, the combination of allenes and indoles as co&#8208;reactants has revealed a fruitful reactivity allowing the synthesis of complex structures and the investigation of new mechanistic pathways, such as the challenging asymmetric nucleophilic addition using optically pure allenes as chirality transfer agents, the double nucleophilic addition through metal carbene intermediates, or novel hybrid catalysis in a bimetallic system. Herein we report a critical review into the wide and fascinating ways allenes and indoles can interact, and the structural diversity that can be therefore achieved.

         <title>Endocyclic Enamides Derived from Aza&#8208;Diketopiperazines as Olefin Partners in Povarov Reaction: An Access to Tetracyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endocyclic enamide having a unique bicyclic structure including a 1,2,4&#8208;triazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dione subunit was used as an olefin partner in the Povarov reaction. This represents an efficient strategy to access a new family of fused tetracyclic N&#8208;heterocycles which combine in their structure two scaffolds of interest in medicinal chemistry, a tetrahydroquinoline (THQ and an aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP).






Original endocyclic enamides based on a bicyclic aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP) structure have been used as dienophile partners in the Povarov reaction. The reported method represents a successful strategy for the structural diversification of the aza&#8208;DKP scaffold, giving access to a new family of fused tetracyclic N&#8208;heterocycles, which contain at least four nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure. Depending on the nature of the aldehyde partner, the cycloadditions have been performed either as a two&#8208;component or a three&#8208;component Povarov reaction (2CPR or 3CPR), in the presence of BF3 as a Lewis acid catalyst. With aliphatic aldehydes the reaction proceeds with high diastereoselectivities in favor of the cis compounds. Some mechanistic aspects of this cycloaddition have been examined computationally.

&lt;p&gt;Original endocyclic enamides based on a bicyclic aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP) structure have been used as dienophile partners in the Povarov reaction. The reported method represents a successful strategy for the structural diversification of the aza&#8208;DKP scaffold, giving access to a new family of fused tetracyclic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycles, which contain at least four nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure. Depending on the nature of the aldehyde partner, the cycloadditions have been performed either as a two&#8208;component or a three&#8208;component Povarov reaction (2CPR or 3CPR), in the presence of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a Lewis acid catalyst. With aliphatic aldehydes the reaction proceeds with high diastereoselectivities in favor of the cis compounds. Some mechanistic aspects of this cycloaddition have been examined computationally.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preparation of Hexahydrocarbazole Derivatives by Reductive Indolization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fischer indolization with phenyl hydrazine derivatives interrupted by reduction with a hydrido borate reagent at the stage of the iminium ion intermediate furnished hexahydro carbazole derivatives with a functionalized side chain at position 4a. The cyclic &#948;&#8208;oxoesters applied in this transformation were obtained from ethyl acrylate and cycloalkanones.






The reductive indolization is a two&#8208;step protocol performed in one flask: First, the acid&#8208;mediated Fischer indolization of a cyclic ketone with phenylhydrazine forms an iminium ion which is subsequently reduced by a hydrido borate reagent to the indoline as the final product. We utilized this new strategy for the preparation of hexahydrocarbazole derivatives with a side chain in the quaternary C4a&#8208;position. Starting materials were several N1&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted phenylhydrazines and a cyclic ketone with propanoic ester moiety, which is the product of the conjugated addition of cyclohexanone to ethyl acrylate. Furthermore, benzannulated congeners as well as a pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]indole derivative were accessed. The hexahydrocarbazole defines a molecular scaffold with two points of diversification. Therefore, several derivatives at N9 and at the C4a&#8208;side chain were prepared.

         <title>Boc&#8208;Protection on L&#8208;DOPA: an Easy Way to Promote Underwater Adhesion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Among four compounds of the family Bocx&#8208;(L&#8208;DOPA)n&#8208;OMe (x = 1&#8211;3; n = 1,2), three of them show good adhesiveness. The introduction of protecting groups stabilizes L&#8208;DOPA, preventing the oxidation of the catechol moiety and enhances the hydrophobicity. These materials show good adhesiveness, with different properties, so they may find applications as green and biocompatible adhesives.






The ability of mussels to adhere to underwater surfaces has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. As proteins containing L&#8208;DOPA (3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;l&#8208;alanine) are involved in their adhesion, a common strategy to synthesize adhesives is the incorporation of this amino acid into other compounds. Herein, we report a study on four compounds of the family of Bocx&#8208;(L&#8208;DOPA)n&#8208;OMe (x = 1&#8211;3; n = 1,2), that we prepared through simple synthetic steps. Three of them showed the capability of underwater adhesion: while they are not adhesive in the dry phase, the adhesiveness is triggered when the dried sample is immersed in water or any aqueous solutions. The introduction of protecting groups stabilizes L&#8208;DOPA, preventing the oxidation of the catechol moiety, and enhances the hydrophobicity, helping the removal of water from the surface to bind. These molecules show good adhesiveness, with different properties, so they may be all used as adhesives for different purposes. These outcomes pave the way for new applications for these materials as green and biocompatible adhesives.

The key steps included deoxofluorination or TMAF&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution in the appropriate bifunctional cyclobutanes; for the CF  3  &#8208;substituted derivatives, alternative methods based on cyano&#8208; or azidotrifluoromethylation of cyclobutene using the Togni reagent II were also proposed. All methods provided  trans  diastereomers of the target primary amines and carboxylic acids (6 representatives) and were suitable for their multigram preparation. Furthermore, dissociation constants (p  K  a  ) and lipophilicity (log  P  ) values were measured to evaluate the effect of the fluoroalkyl substituents on acidity/basicity and lipophilicity of the building blocks obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry as a Sustainable Method for the Preparation of Fluorescent Ugi BODIPY Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, i. e., the use of mechanical energy produced by milling or grinding to perform chemical transformations, was used as a green strategy using a minimal amount of solvent for the preparation of highly valuable formyl functionalized BODIPY dyes. The stereoelectronic properties of the  meso  &#8208;aryl group plays a key role in the fluorescence response of the adducts resulting from the Ugi reaction. Such an understanding of the molecular structure&#8208;fluorescence interplay explains the brightness of these dyes in the cellular media monitored by fluorescence imaging. In the present report, we provide flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy evidence that the novel dyes stain efficiently peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and  Candida albicans  cells without disturbing cell integrity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by staining  C. albicans  cells, we can monitor the early and late steps of phagocytosis, using human monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages. The dye series presented herein represent a novel application for formyl functionalized BODIPY, expanding their applications in monitoring biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactones through Reaction of Sulfoxonium Ylides, Aldehydes and Ketenes: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article we describe the synthesis of  &#947;  &#8208;lactones through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and disubstituted ketenes.&#160; The one&#8208;pot sequential method provides access to  &#947;  &#8208;lactones from disubstituted ketenes, in moderate to excellent yields, and with good diastereoselectivity favoring the  trans  &#8208;diastereomer (dr up to 92:8).&#160; The reaction mechanism was investigated by performing labeling, crossover and various control experiments.&#160; The results of those experiments support the reaction mechanism involving betaine formation, reaction of the betaine with a ketene to form an enolate intermediate, [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of an enolate intermediate, and finally 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;  tet  cyclization to afford the  &#947;  &#8208;lactone product.</dc:description>

         <title>InBr3&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction between Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenyl Ethers with Silyl Enolates for Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InBr3 catalysis enables the coupling between 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers and silyl enolates to give 1,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes featuring alkene moieties with perfect stereoselectivity. Various types of 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers and silyl enolates are applicable to the present reaction. InBr3 with moderate Lewis acidity plays an important role in both the activation of alkenyl ethers and in the elimination of alkoxy groups regardless of the presence of various coordinative functional groups.






A coupling reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkenyl ethers with silyl enolates catalyzed by InBr3 was achieved. Various silyl enolates and 2&#8208;carbonylalkenyl ethers were applicable, giving the corresponding 1,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes with perfect stereoselectivity of the alkene moieties. The present coupling reaction proceeds via the 1,4&#8208;addition of silyl enolates to alkenyl ethers followed by elimination of silyl alkoxides, in which moderate&#8208;Lewis acidic InBr3 performs both the activation of alkenyl ethers and the elimination of alkoxy groups regardless of the presence of various coordinative functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Anemoclemosides A and B, Two Saponins Isolated from Anemoclema glaucifolium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The straightforward and scalable syntheses of the triterpenoid saponins Anemoclemoside A and B are described. Both compounds feature an unusual cyclic acetal linkage to the carbohydrate l&#8208;arabinose in its open chain form. A mild and facile method was employed to construct the characteristic cyclic acetal glycosidic linkage in both saponins via the PTSA catalyzed condensation of benzyl hederagenate with the respective saccharide side chains.






Steroidal and triterpenoid saponins are attractive for their wide&#8208;ranging pharmacological properties. The triterpenoid saponins Anemoclemoside A and B are root constituents of the Chinese folk medicinal plant Anemoclema glaucifolium (Ranunculaceae). Both compounds feature an unusual cyclic acetal linkage to the carbohydrate l&#8208;arabinose in its open chain form rather than the typical glycosidic bond present in normal saponins. The straightforward and scalable syntheses of both saponins starting from l&#8208;arabinose as well as l&#8208;lyxose and l&#8208;rhamnose are described.

         <title>Oxidative and Redox&#8208;Neutral Approaches to Symmetrical Diamines and Diols by Single Electron Transfer/Hydrogen Atom Transfer Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative and redox&#8208;neutral coupling reactions of benzylamines and benzyl alcohols to provide symmetrical diamines and diols proceed smoothly under HAT/SET synergistic catalysis to give symmetrical diamines and diols.






Homocoupling reactions of benzylamines and benzyl alcohols were examined under synergistic catalysis conditions with a photoredox catalyst and thiobenzoic acid as a hydrogen atom abstractor. When pivalaldehyde was used as an electron acceptor, oxidative dimerization proceeded selectively, whereas the use of benzaldehydes or iminium ions as electron acceptors resulted in redox&#8208;neutral coupling. These reactions afforded symmetrical 1,2&#8208;diamines and 1,2&#8208;diols in good yields.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Rigid Multidimensional Alkoxyamines: A Building Block Library for Polymer Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the &#8220;living&#8221; free&#8208;radical polymerization, alkoxyamines were widely used in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP). Most of the known alkoxyamines bear just one functionality with only a few exceptions bearing two or more alkoxyamine units. Herein, we present a library of novel multidimensional alkoxyamines based on commercially available, rigid, aromatic core structures. A versatile approach allows the introduction of different sidechains which have an impact on the steric hindrance and dissociation behavior of the alkoxyamines. The reaction to the alkoxyamines was optimized by implementing a mild and reliable procedure to give all target compounds in high yields. Utilization of biphenyl, p&#8208;terphenyl, 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, tetraphenylethylene, and tetraphenyl&#8208;methane results in linear, trigonal, square planar, and tetrahedral shaped alkoxyamines. These building blocks are useful initiators for multifold NMP leading to star&#8208;shaped polymers or as a linker for the nitroxide exchange reaction (NER), to obtain dynamic frameworks with a tunable crosslinking degree and self&#8208;healing abilities.</dc:description>

The lowest transition state of interconversion between natural dixiamycins A and B containing a&#160;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole&#160;structure was revised to be the&#160;trans&#160;transition state.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed direct access to (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkylideneindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through oxidative condensation of oxindoles with benzylamines is described. The procedure utilizes molecular oxygen as a clean and terminal oxidant.






A novel synthetic route for the construction of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkylideneindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through iron&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative condensation of oxindoles with benzylamines has been developed. This oxidative reaction involves a sequence of C&#8211;H activation, amine self&#8208;condensation, nucleophilic addition, and C&#8211;C double bond formation. The synthetic importance of this protocol has been demonstrated by preparing tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anticonvulsant and antitumor agents, and other valuable 3&#8208;alkylideneindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. Key intermediates are isolated and a plausible mechanistic pathway for the reaction has been discussed.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Push&#8211;Pull Imines by a Selective C&#8211;F Substitution Process in Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of push&#8211;pull imines is reported, which are formed through a selective aromatic nucleophilic substitution of fluoroarenes by N&#8211;H substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs), without the need of any additional catalyst. As a result, a straightforward methodology was developed for the formation of different fluoroaryl&#8208;substituted push&#8211;pull imines.






Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of push&#8211;pull imines by considering cyclic diamino substituent at the C&#8208;centre and fluoroaryl substituent at the N&#8208;centre. This has been achieved by a selective aromatic nucleophilic substitution of different fluoroarenes by N&#8208;H&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) at ambient conditions without any additional reagent. Solid&#8208;state molecular structure analysis reveals the elongation of the central C&#8211;N bond of the imine functionality, which is consistent with the push&#8211;pull nature of these imines. The push&#8211;pull nature of these imines is further validated by computational studies.

         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitutions of benzylic alcohols with sulfamides were achieved using an FeCl3 Lewis acid catalyst in MeNO2. It was necessary to adjust the reaction conditions to obtain efficient yields depending on the stability of the carbocation intermediates. The reaction could easily be performed, and it was revealed that a variety of diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were applicable to the reaction, irrespective of the type and position of the substituents. The sulfamide moieties were easily deprotected and converted into amine groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, chiral resolution and optical properties of 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a simple and efficient approach to synthesize a long functionalized 2,18&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9] helicene. It was synthesized from simple phenol building blocks using two subsequent reactions namely oxidative coupling and dehydrative cyclization or palladium mediated cyclization. The molecular integrity of the helical core was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR techniques. Its crystal structure showed the spontaneous resolution which was attributed to the conglomerate formation of same helical isomer via C&#8722;H  &#183;&#183;&#183;&#160;  O and &#960;  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; or H  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; interactions. Then, it was converted to racemic 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene. Enantiomers were separated on preparative HPLC with high optical purity (&gt; 99 %  ee  ). Based on electronic circular dichroism, the absolute configurations of dextrorotary and levorotatory antipodes were assigned as  P  and  M  , respectively. We also studied the absorption, emission and chiroptical behavior of these helical compounds in the solution state.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the rhodium(III) and iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amidation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with a range of nitrene surrogates including dioxazolones dioxazolones, organic azides, and N&#8208;methoxyamides through N&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation. Complete site&#8208;selectivity and functional group tolerance are observed. Notably, the large&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization highlight the synthetic potential of the developed protocol. This work is dedicated to Prof. Pierre H. Dixneuf for his outstanding contribution to organometallic chemistry and catalysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Hong, I.&#160;S. Kim et al.

         <title>Front Cover: trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Chiral Ligands in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Additions (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes that serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. It is demonstrated for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis. As the asymmetric environment around the reaction site is constructed by the trans&#8208;cyclooctene framework, the introduction of a substituent at the allylic position further improves enantioselectivity to 93% ee. These findings provide new chiral framework designs for the asymmetric ligands of metal catalysts. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Asano, S. Matsubara et al.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a new substitution pattern obtained when reacting phenanthrolines with organolithium compounds. Contrary to the now classical 2,9&#8208;disubstitution described in the seminal paper of Christiane Dietrich&#8208;Buchecker et al., to whom this article is dedicated, a 2,7&#8208;disubstitution pattern was found by chance under given conditions. A rare spontaneous resolution of its bis(phenanthroline)copper(I) complex in the solid state is also described in the article. (cover picture created by Nina Hernandez).

         <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up to date review regarding the SNAr of seven different types of porphyrinoids, each containing differing numbers and types of pyrrole rings and meso positions is presented. The reactivity and mechanistic analysis of subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines shows a bright future for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids via this reaction mechanism.






The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (SNAr) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. Currently, several &#8220;types&#8221; of SNAr reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein, we detail the SNAr reactions of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.

         <title>Substituted Naphthols: Preparations, Applications, and Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted Naphthols are amongst some of the most important carbocycles in organic chemistry. This review focuses on a plethora of important routes to access such structures of high value. Emphasis on reactants employed, reaction types, and their mechanisms is examined.






Substituted naphthols (SNs) are an important class of chemical compounds present in many natural and synthetic products with biological and pharmaceutical activities. Moreover, the naphthol skeleton has been employed as a starting material for the development of drug molecules and natural products. Thus, different synthetic methods to access naphthol cores have been reported using diverse starting materials and chemical strategies. This review article describes literature on synthetic methodologies of substituted naphthols synthesized from alkynes, sulfur ylides, diazo substrates, alkenes/cyclopropenes, ketones/oxanorbenes/furans, amongst other key reactants.

         <title>Theoretical Study of the Mechanism of Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Ester&#8208;Substituted Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms of the palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a diyne diester with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and of the [2+2+2] cyclization of a triyne diester were investigated using density functional theory calculations. The roles of the ester substituents on the alkyne substrates and of the triphenylphosphine ligand are discussed based on the obtained results.

After evaluating the kinetic and thermodynamic profiles of each reaction, the roles of the ester substituents on the alkyne substrates and of the triphenylphosphine ligand are discussed based on the obtained results.

         <title>Facile Construction of Benzofulvene Scaffold from Tetraaryl[3]cumulene Through Electrophilic Iodocyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of tetraaryl[3]cumulenes with N&#8208;iodosuccinimide afforded the corresponding iodinated triarylbenzofulvenes with high yields under mild reaction conditions through electrophilic iodocyclization. The iodinated benzofulvene was successfully used as versatile precursor for common cross&#8208;coupling reaction.






We found that the reaction of tetraaryl[3]cumulenes with N&#8208;iodosuccinimide afforded the corresponding iodinated triarylbenzofulvenes with high yields under mild reaction conditions. Unsymmetrical tetraaryl[3]cumulenes underwent regioselective reactions to give a single isomer of benzofulvenes depending on the aryl substituents. The obtained iodinated benzofulvene was successfully used as aryl iodide for common cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and the corresponding tetrasubstituted benzofulvenes was easily accessed via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, respectively.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Aminoalkylation of 5&#8208;Aminopyrazole Derivatives with Cyclic Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective alkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles is described with good results. The organocatalytic alkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles have been accomplished using benzoxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxides as electrophiles and a bifunctional squaramide organocatalyst.






In this communication, an efficient asymmetric aminoalkylation of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic benzoxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxides catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived squaramide in dichloromethane has been established. This is the first example of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives in asymmetric catalysis. A variety of chiral sulfamidates bearing an aminopyrazole moiety were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%ee).

         <title>Expedient synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolidines via telescoping reactions including iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer and Domino Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization (DROC)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;iminothiazolidines are important scaffold for pharmaceutical drugs. Herein, we describe a fast and easy procedure for their synthesis by a telescoping reaction integrating an iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer under mild conditions. The aziridination reaction of olefins is followed by the domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) of the aziridine intermediates with organic isothiocyanates catalyzed by a Lewis acid leading to the desired product. This new synthetic route allows time, step and purification economies, which is in agreement with the development of more efficient processes for the synthesis of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

The Si&#8208;containing three membered ring systems lack stability, due to the high strain, hence need tremendous efforts for its preparation.

         <title>Evolution of Strategies in Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of Natural Products: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights the recently achieved efficient total syntheses of many natural products based on chiron, auxiliary, cascade, biomimetic and photocatalytic approaches, as well as protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free strategies, leading to overall economy and efficiency in synthesis.






The synthesis of complex natural products must be realized with high economy and efficiency, contributing largely to sustainable development in synthetic organic chemistry. The new strategies should adopt protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free approaches enabling step&#8208;economy and thereby enhancing efficiency. Various approaches based on chiral pool, auxiliary&#8208;based methods, cascade, biomimetic, enzymatic and photocatalytic used in total synthesis of natural products and following the PGF&#8208;criteria over the last two years (2018&#8211;2019) have been reviewed here. These should guide sustainable synthesis of natural products in the future.

         <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of distinct mechanically active components is a promising approach to build molecular machines that perform useful tasks. A key concern in the design stage is the strict stimuli&#8208;orthogonality for selective operation of the individual components. Herein, notable examples of molecular switches and motors powered by different stimuli to show multiple dynamic features are surveyed.






Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Allenes and their Application to One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Functionalized Fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]furans by Calcium&#8208;Catalyzed, Regioselective, 3&#8208;Component Reactions</title>

A novel synthetic methodology for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction is developed from propargyl alcohols and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls through the formation of tetra&#8208;substituted allenes as the key intermediates.






We have developed a novel synthetic methodology for the preparation of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction. In this reaction, tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols react with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to form tetra&#8208;substituted allenes, which are subsequently undergoing regiodivergent annulation with sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols to produce the fluorene&#8208;fused furan compounds. Broad substrate scope, regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and benzylic functionalization of products are some of the highlights of this protocol.

         <title>Hydroarylation of N&#8208;Allenyl Derivatives Catalyzed by Copper[**]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereoselective addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to N&#8208;allenyl derivatives is described under copper catalysis. represents the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.






An additive&#8208;free copper catalytic system was used to perform the addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to N&#8208;allenyl derivatives. This intermolecular C&#8211;C bond formation occurs with both complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to afford the linear (E) allylic product with moderate to excellent yields. This atom economical method is the first example of hydroarylation of allenes catalyzed by copper.

         <title>Triptycene End&#8208;Capped Indigo Derivatives &#8211; Turning Insoluble Pigments to Soluble Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triptycene end&#8208;capping is the solution to turn insoluble pigments into soluble dyes by a factor of 70, making them potential good electron&#8208;acceptors for various organic electronics applications.






The synthesis of a highly soluble triptycene end&#8208;capped indigo and its bay annulated derivative is reported. Both compounds have been studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy cyclic voltammetry, as well as theoretical calculations and compared to the parent indigo and bay annulated indigo. Besides a large improvement of solubility in organic solvents by the factor of approx. 70(!) the compounds also show a pronounced tendency to form crystals. Both properties, making these compounds promising electron acceptors for organic electronics.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;oxidative prototropic&#8208; and valence tautomeric equilibria are responsible for the exclusive formation of p&#8208;quinones in the &#955;5&#8208;iodane oxidation of cannabinoids. O&#8208;Methylation prevents prototropic equilibration and, by complementary timing of oxidation and methylation steps, isomeric ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cannabinoquinoids could be obtained.






Spurred by the remarkable biological profile of cannabinoquinoids, we have systematically investigated the periodinane oxidation of their resorcinolic precursors, discovering that the regiochemistry of oxidation, a critical maneuver for bioactivity, depends not only on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs. &#955;5&#8208;iodanes), but also on post&#8208;oxidative prototropic&#8208; and valence tautomeric equilibria that isomerize ortho&#8208;quinones to para&#8208;quinones. By complementary selection of the periodinane oxidant and by freezing prototropic equilibration with O&#8208;methylation, isomeric ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;quinones could be obtained from mono&#8208; and diphenolic cannabinoids, setting the stage for the exploration of novel areas of the biological space, and establishing a blueprint for the extension of this strategy to other classes of bioactive alkylresorcinols.

         <title>Thiourea&#8211;Tertiary Amine Promoted Cascade Catalysis: A Tool for Complexity Generation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in the area of the thiourea&#8211;tert&#8208;amine promoted, single catalyst&#8208;relay cascade catalysis for the last fifteen years (2005&#8211;2020). This would give the readers the current state of the art of this important area in organic synthesis for the generation of chiral polycyclic systems. We assume that the current review would be a handle for the design and development, as well as further growth of this potentially greener approach.






The bifunctional organocatalyst promoted, relay&#8208;cascade catalysis (use of a single catalyst capable of promoting each catalytic cycle in the designed cascade process) has been the hot area of research in recent times, as it enables the green synthesis of complex molecular architectures in an atom, cost, and step&#8208;economic fashion. In this context we summarized the recent developments in the area of the thiourea&#8211;tert&#8208;amine based cascade catalysis in the current review article. The discussion was divided into three subsections. double&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple cascades depending on the number of individual steps involved in the cascade process. In each type there are various combinations of reactions like Michael addition, aldol reaction, Henry reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, cyclization, trans&#8208;esterifications etc. Divergent polycyclic structural frameworks have been achieved employing this cascade catalytic strategy as evidenced in this review. We assume that the current review article would be a handle for the design and development as well as further growth of this potential greener approach.

         <title>Water&#8208;Promoted Dehydrative Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction of Non&#8208;Derivatized Allylic Alcohols with Sulfinic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promoting effect of water was observed, leading to the dehydrative synthesis of allylic sulfones byTsuji&#8211;Trost reaction of non&#8208;derivatized allylic alcohols with sulfinic acids. Mechanism studies suggested the formation of the eight&#8208;membered ring complex from allylic alcohols, sulfinic acids, and water through hydrogen bonding may be crucial to the efficient activation of allylic alcohols.






A mild, green and extra activator&#8208;free synthesis of allylic sulfones from non&#8208;derivatized allylic alcohols and sulfinic acids was developed and only the easily&#8208;available Pd(PPh3)4 was used as the catalyst. This new method could be easily scaled up to gram scale, affording the target allylic sulfones in a nearly quantitative yield with water as the sole by&#8208;product. Mechanism studies both by various NMR techniques and by theoretical calculations suggested two reaction pathways may be involved in the reaction, which are dependent on the reaction media, that is, an eight&#8208;membered ring binding species may be formed in aqueous media between allylic alcohol, sulfinic acid and water, while a six&#8208;membered ring binding species may be formed in common aprotic organic solvent between allylic alcohol and sulfinic acid. Both binding species may be accounted for the efficient activation of allylic alcohols via hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Styrene Hetero&#8208; and Homodimerization Initiation Proceeds with Two&#8208;Electron Reductive Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rather than sequential single&#8208;electron transfer, the alkene dimerization catalyzed by a hypervalent iodine reagent is initialized by a two&#8208;electron transfer via a trimolecular complex organized by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. This process is stepwise for the I(III) reagent and concerted for the I(V) reagent.






A mechanistic insight into the hetero&#8208; and homodimerizations (HETD and HOMD) of styrenes promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents (HVIRs; DMP and PIDA) and facilitated by hexafluoro2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) to yield all&#8208;trans cyclobutanes is reported using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The initialization involving direct bimolecular one&#8208;electron transfer is found to be highly unfavored, especially for the PIDA system. At this point, we suggest that the reaction is initiated with an overall two&#8208;electron reductive cleavage of two I&#8211;O bond cleavages, affording I(III) (iodinane) and I(I) (iodobenzene) product with DMP and PIDA as oxidant, respectively. The resulting acetate groups are stabilized by the solvent HFIP through strong hydrogen bonding interaction, which promotes the electron transfer process. The nature of the electron transfer is studied in detail and found that the overall two&#8208;electron transfer occurs within a trimolecular complex organized by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and as a stepwise and concerted mechanism for I(III) and I(V) oxidants, respectively. The reaction rate is determined by the initialization step: for I(III), the initiation is thermodynamically endergonic, whereas the endergonicity for I(V) is modest. Upon initialization, the reaction proceeds through a stepwise [2+2] pathway, involving a radical&#8208;cationic &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked transition states, where the HOMD is a dynamically competing pathway to HETD although the latter is relatively faster.

         <title>Symmetrical Tertiary Amines: Applications and Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The World is &#8220;based&#8221; on some principle components. One type of such &#8220;bases&#8221; is the symmetrical tertiary amines. Applications of such amines and different approaches to their synthesis are described in this review.






Tertiary amines represent a key class of organic molecules with multiple industrial, synthetic, and analytical applications. The focus of this review is on different approaches towards the synthesis of the C3 and C3V symmetrical tertiary amines. Generally, symmetrical tertiary amines can be prepared via N&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides and alcohols, reductive amination, desamination, hydroamination of olefins, and different kinds of C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. All reactions leading to the titled structures are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are provided.

         <title>Biomedical Hydrogels Fabricated Using Diels&#8211;Alder Crosslinking</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interest in Diels&#8208;Alder conjugation for biomaterials development is constantly increasing. In this minireview we highlight how this one step reaction can be employed to develop drug delivery systems and scaffold for tissue engineering. An overview of recent examples is provided in which DA cycloaddition has been exploited under mild condition and eventually in presence of cells.






The Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition is one of the best methods for biomaterials conjugation to generate tools for biomedical applications. It is a biocompatible one&#8208;step reaction, exploiting functional groups absent in natural biopolymers, doesn't require catalysts, and doesn't generate side products, an ideal &#8220;click reaction&#8221;. In this review we provide an overview on the recent examples in which the DA cycloaddition has been exploited in nanomedicine. Nanoparticles for drug delivery or diagnosis, and nanostructured biomaterials for regenerative medicine, have been efficiently generated exploiting the DA reaction to crosslink the polymeric components, in order to obtain nanoparticles or scaffolds with the required chemical and morphological properties, and to conjugate targeting agents or signalling molecules.

         <title>Cyclative MCRs of Azines and Azinium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The high atom economic feature of multicomponent reactions may open the way to sustainable pharmaceutical chemical processes. This review covers their recent applications for the synthesis N&#8208;heterocycles emphasizing dearomatizative examples.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Since the first discovery by Huigsen and co&#8208;workers fifty years ago, a wide range of organic reactions have taken place through the intermediary of the dipolar/zwitterionic species produced by the combination of a neutral nucleophile and an unsaturated electrophile. Nucleophilic initiators including heterocycles may react or play a mediating role based on their nucleophilic nature and reaction conditions. This review highlights the recent developments of the cyclization chemistry of heterocycles using multicomponent reactions (MCRs) &#8211; including unusual dearomatizative examples. Heterocycles as very common structural units can often be found in natural and pharmaceutical products. MCRs are environmentally benign and highly atom economic reactions. Their application in the synthesis of biologically active molecules may provide alternatives for the greener synthesis of drugs lowering the carbon footprint of pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Recent Progress in Non&#8208;Catalytic C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The present review demonstrates that the synthetic potential of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides performs it possible to successfully use them in the synthesis and modification of substances with high molecular complexity, including natural targets. Several effective catalyst&#8208;free approaches for regioselective C&#8211;O, C&#8211;S, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;N, and C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling, including Suzuki&#8208; and Heck&#8208;like reactions, are especially noteworthy.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Considerable attention holds on the chemistry and application of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides due to their advantages as building&#8208;blocks in organic synthesis and importance in biomedical research. On the other hand, in recent years the development of selective methods for constructing C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;O bonds via direct C&#8211;H functionalization has become especially demand in organic synthesis. These circumstances determine the significance of this minireview, which present recent advances in the field of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides. Data on various type reactions which formal result is the replacement of a hydrogen atom in a heterocycle, with the exclusion of methods using heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, are summarized. Presented works for the last 15 years, since 2006.

         <title>Overcoming the Hurdles and Challenges Associated with Developing Continuous Industrial Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Flow chemistry, on paper, is a straightforward concept with most chemists from academia and industry now well versed in the associated advantages. This Minireview highlights some of the common pitfalls and considers solutions to successfully navigate implementation of cryogenic flow processes or those whereby solid handling is required. This should accelerate the development of similar processes and help chemists to avoid the pitfalls!
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Continuous flow chemistry is often viewed as a very simple concept on paper, however scientists with significant flow chemistry experience will highlight a number of challenges that need to be overcome. Critical for the successful development of any flow process is a high level of understanding of potential pitfalls that may be encountered. A collaborative and multi&#8208;disciplinary team of chemists and chemical engineers is essential in the development of a process from lab scale through to production. This Minireview will identify and highlight relevant risks and their subsequent mitigation strategies to ensure successful flow processing.

         <title>Calcium Carbide: Versatile Synthetic Applications, Green Methodology and Sustainability</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Advantageous potential of calcium carbide as a solid acetylene reagent in organic chemistry is highlighted in this review. Synthetic opportunities are mapped to expand the synthetic applications of C&#8801;C unit. Particular attention is focused on new approaches elaborated in a recent period.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations. However, critical analysis of practical considerations showed that application of gaseous acetylene in regular synthetic labs encounters a number of difficulties. Safety limitations due to flammable and explosive nature of gaseous acetylene and requirements for specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment impose serious drawbacks. Typical reaction conditions involve excess of gaseous reactant, which is simply released to the atmosphere at the end of the reaction, thus generating waste and causing contamination. Calcium carbide brings a new green and sustainable wave into powerful alkyne transformations and significantly expands the repertoire of traditional acetylene chemistry. The novel trend of using calcium carbide instead of gaseous acetylene is synthetically beneficial and opens a novel reactivity for the C&#8801;C unit. This review highlights recent advances in carbide chemistry, demonstrates its advantages and prospects in term of green synthetic approach.

         <title>A New Phenanthroline Ligand and the Spontaneous Resolution of its Homoleptic Copper(I) Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A benzyl substituent was regioselectively introduced at the 7 position after a first substitution at the 2 position of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, by using aryl&#8208;lithio reagents generated with tert&#8208;butyllithium in toluene. Among the complexes prepared (Pd(II), Cu(I)) with these new ligands, a chiral copper(I) complex exhibits spontaneous resolution in the solid state.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  During the synthesis of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives sterically hindered in the 2 and/or 9 positions, serendipity led to the discovery of a new substitution pattern on phenanthroline with good and reproducible yields. When toluene was used as a solvent and the aryl&#8208;lithio reagents generated with tBuLi, after a first substitution at the 2 position, a benzyl substituent was regioselectively introduced at the 7 position. It is proposed that the benzyllithium reagent is formed by reaction with the solvent and that the steric hindrance on the intermediates controls the nucleophilic addition. Among the complexes prepared (Pd(II), Cu(I)) with these new ligands, a chiral copper(I) complex exhibits spontaneous resolution in the solid state.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Amidation of 2&#8208;Aryl Quinazolinones Using Nitrene Surrogates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  The site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H amidation of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with dioxazolones under rhodium(III) catalysis is described. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization, and synthetic transformations highlight the potential of the developed method.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The site&#8208;selective modifications of quinazolinones constitute a pivotal topic in drug discovery and material science. Herein, we describe the rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amidation of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with a range of nitrene surrogates including dioxazolones, organic azides, and N&#8208;methoxyamides. Complete site&#8208;selectivity and functional group tolerance are observed. Notably, the large&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization highlight the synthetic potential of the developed protocol. Combined mechanistic investigations elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism of this process.

         <dc:description>
  Simple Cinchona alkaloids serve as nucleophilic organocatalysts to facilitate the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters by using hypervalent iodine&#8208;based Cl&#8208;transfer reagents
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We herein report an unprecedented strategy for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters with hypervalent iodine&#8208;based Cl&#8208;transfer reagents using simple Cinchona alkaloid catalysts. Our investigations support an &#945;&#8208;chlorination mechanism where the Cinchona species serves as a nucleophilic catalyst by reacting with the chlorinating agent to generate a chiral electrophilic Cl&#8208;transfer reagent in situ. Using at least 20 mol&#8208;% of the alkaloid catalyst allows for good yields and enantioselectivities for a variety of different &#946;&#8208;keto esters under operationally simple conditions.

         <title>A Review on Oxidative Gold&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Arenes &#8211; Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  This review describes the evolution of gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylations over the past century. In particular, it presents the mechanistic rationalization in the development from stoichiometric to catalytic approaches, intrinsic challenges associated with the unique mode of bond activation by gold, and systematic investigations to expand the chemical space for diverse synthetic strategies.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Cross&#8208;coupling strategies have become essential in modern organic synthesis. While palladium has historically dominated this field, other transition metals have arisen as potent and orthogonal alternatives. Gold, typically thought of as just a Lewis acid, has recently demonstrated redox chemistry in several cross&#8208;coupling reactions using an external oxidant. One of these branches, oxidative C&#8211;H functionalizations, has made significant advances in recent years. Herein, we discuss the discovery and development of gold catalysis in this realm with particular focus on improvements in scope and mechanistic understandings in relation to biaryl couplings.

         <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.
