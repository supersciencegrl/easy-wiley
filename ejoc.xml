      <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydration of 1&#8208;Iodoalkynes Leading to &#945;&#8208;Iodoketones</title>
      <dc:description>
The Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration of 1&#8208;iodoalkynes is reported, using a gold(I)&#8211;NHC catalyst. A variety of &#945;&#8208;iodomethyl ketones are thus accessed in good to excellent yields. Several sequential protocols were also developed, leading to the construction of molecular complexity.






A catalytic protocol for the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration of 1&#8208;iodoalkynes is disclosed. The use of Au(I)&#8211;NHC catalyst enabled the straightforward synthesis of a variety of &#945;&#8208;iodomethyl ketones in good to excellent yields. The utility of this simple method is further highlighted by showcasing iodination/hydration and hydration/oxidation sequential protocols leading to the construction of molecular complexity.

      <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Substitutions of Benzylic Alcohols with Sulfamides</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitutions of benzylic alcohols with sulfamides were achieved using an FeCl3 Lewis acid catalyst in MeNO2. It was necessary to adjust the reaction conditions to obtain efficient yields depending on the stability of the carbocation intermediates. The reaction could easily be performed, and it was revealed that a variety of diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were applicable to the reaction, irrespective of the type and position of the substituents. The sulfamide moieties were easily deprotected and converted into amine groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, chiral resolution and optical properties of 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report a simple and efficient approach to synthesize a long functionalized 2,18&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9] helicene. It was synthesized from simple phenol building blocks using two subsequent reactions namely oxidative coupling and dehydrative cyclization or palladium mediated cyclization. The molecular integrity of the helical core was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR techniques. Its crystal structure showed the spontaneous resolution which was attributed to the conglomerate formation of same helical isomer via C&#8722;H  &#183;&#183;&#183;&#160;  O and &#960;  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; or H  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; interactions. Then, it was converted to racemic 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene. Enantiomers were separated on preparative HPLC with high optical purity (&gt; 99 %  ee  ). Based on electronic circular dichroism, the absolute configurations of dextrorotary and levorotatory antipodes were assigned as  P  and  M  , respectively. We also studied the absorption, emission and chiroptical behavior of these helical compounds in the solution state.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes that serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. It is demonstrated for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis. As the asymmetric environment around the reaction site is constructed by the trans&#8208;cyclooctene framework, the introduction of a substituent at the allylic position further improves enantioselectivity to 93% ee. These findings provide new chiral framework designs for the asymmetric ligands of metal catalysts. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Asano, S. Matsubara et al.

      <title>Front Cover: Synthesis of Peptido RNAs from Unprotected Peptides and Oligoribonucleotides via Coupling in Aqueous Solution (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the structure of a peptido RNA that was prepared in NMR quantities from a peptide and an oligoribonucleotide in aqueous solution, without the need for protecting groups. The two&#8208;step protocol starts with conversion of the 5'&#8208;terminal phosphate of the RNA to an imidazolide, followed by 1&#8208;ethylimidazole&#8208;catalyzed coupling at pH 8 that produces the phosphoramidate&#8208;linked final product. The method opens the door to the systematic investigation of molecular hybrids implicated in the origin of RNA&#8208;directed protein synthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Richert et al.

      <dc:description>2&#8208;iminothiazolidines are important scaffold for pharmaceutical drugs. Herein, we describe a fast and easy procedure for their synthesis by a telescoping reaction integrating an iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer under mild conditions. The aziridination reaction of olefins is followed by the domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) of the aziridine intermediates with organic isothiocyanates catalyzed by a Lewis acid leading to the desired product. This new synthetic route allows time, step and purification economies, which is in agreement with the development of more efficient processes for the synthesis of small molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

The Cover Feature shows the iconic &#8220;Infinity Corridor&#8221; of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Metaphorically, it represents the ongoing efforts towards the synthesis of bacterial nonulosonic acids. The structurally complex nonulosonic acids are present at the termini of bacterial cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates and thereby play key roles in pathogen&#8208;host interactions. In this review, we have summarized the biosynthetic, enzymatic or chemical approaches to access three types of nonulosonic acids viz. Legionaminic acid (Leg), Acinetaminic acid (Aci), and Fusaminic acid (Fus) from diverse starting materials. More information can be found in the Minireview by K.&#160;Pradhan and S.&#160;S.

      <title>In Situ Generation of Allenes and their Application to One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Functionalized Fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]furans by Calcium&#8208;Catalyzed, Regioselective, 3&#8208;Component Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel synthetic methodology for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction is developed from propargyl alcohols and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls through the formation of tetra&#8208;substituted allenes as the key intermediates.






We have developed a novel synthetic methodology for the preparation of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction. In this reaction, tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols react with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to form tetra&#8208;substituted allenes, which are subsequently undergoing regiodivergent annulation with sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols to produce the fluorene&#8208;fused furan compounds. Broad substrate scope, regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and benzylic functionalization of products are some of the highlights of this protocol.

Conversely to the output from standard classical cycloaddition approaches, an unconventional connectivity is achieved with excellent chemoselectivity under neat conditions without requiring any metal catalyst or additional additive.

      <title>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of aryl pinacolboronate esters: alcohols as solvents  with application to  6&#8208;L&#8208;[18F]FDOPA  synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination of arylboronic acid pinacol esters (ArylBPin) using Cu(OTf)  2  (Py)  4  complex is a useful approach for the introduction [  18  F]fluorine into&#160; non&#8208;activated arenes and heteroarenes. Due to complexity of the mechanism and wide variation in substrate reactivity the choice of reaction conditions must be made individually for every precursor. Careful selection of phase&#8208;transfer catalysts also plays a role, as Cu&#8208;catalyst and ArylBPin precursors are known to be unstable in basic conditions. Using tetrabuthylammonium triflate alcohol solution for elution of [  18  F]fluoride from ion&#8208;exchange cartridge and employing same alcohol as a co&#8208;solvent in the following labelling step, we have developed a general protocol resulting in &gt;80% fluorination efficiency of ArylBPin precursors for 4&#8208;[  18  F]fluoro&#8208;D,L&#8208;phenylalanine and 6&#8208;L&#8208;[  18  F]FDOPA. Radiofuorination in neat alcohol was particularly effective for the synthesis of 6&#8208;L&#8208;[  18  F]FDOPA, allowing for substantial increase of yield and decrease of synthesis time compared to current methods (activity yield 14.5 &#177; 0.5%, 70 min synthesis time).</dc:description>

      <title>Endocyclic Enamides Derived from Aza&#8208;Diketopiperazines as Olefin Partners in Povarov Reaction: An Access to Tetracyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Original endocyclic enamides based on a bicyclic aza&#8208;diketopiperazine (aza&#8208;DKP) structure have been used as dienophile partners in the Povarov reaction. The reported method represents a successful strategy for the structural diversification of the aza&#8208;DKP scaffold, giving access to a new family of fused tetracyclic&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocycles, which contain at least four nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure. Depending on the nature of the aldehyde partner, the cycloadditions have been performed either as a two&#8208;component or a three&#8208;component reaction (2CR or 3CR), in the presence of BF  3  &#160;as a Lewis acid catalyst. With aliphatic aldehydes the reaction proceeds with high diastereoselectivities in favor of the cis compounds.

      <title>When Indoles Meet Allene and its Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>The allene functional group and the indole ring have emerged as recurring building blocks in organic chemistry due to their diverse reactivity and straightforward preparation. In addition, indole biological properties and natural occurrence gives a remarkable added&#8208;value to newly&#8208;prepared indole&#8208;based structures. In the last decade, combination of allenes and indoles as co&#8208;reactants has revealed a fruitful reactivity allowing the synthesis of complex structures and the investigation on new mechanistic pathways, such as the challenging asymmetric nucleophilic addition using optically pure allenes as chirality transfer agents, the double nucleophilic addition through metal carbene intermediates, or novel hybrid catalysis in a bimetallic system. Herein we report a critical review into the wide and fascinating ways allenes and indoles can interact, and the structural diversity that can be therefore achieved.</dc:description>

Herein we report a critical review into the wide and fascinating ways allenes and indoles can interact, and the structural diversity that can be therefore achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Syntheses and applications of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles: A decade review</title>
      <dc:description>Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents as an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This thriving scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the enabling strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulphur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Boc&#8208;protection on L&#8208;DOPA: an easy way to promote underwater adhesion</title>
      <dc:description>Mussels&#8217; ability to adhere to underwater surfaces has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. As proteins containing L&#8208;DOPA (3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine) are involved in mussels&#8217; adhesion, a common strategy to synthesize adhesives is the incorporation of this amino acid into other compounds. Here we report a study on four compounds of the family of Boc  x  &#8208;(L&#8208;DOPA)  n  &#8208;OMe (x = 1&#8208;3; n = 1,2), that we prepared through simple synthetic steps. Three of them showed the capability of underwater adhesion: while they are not adhesive in the dry phase, the adhesiveness is triggered when the dried sample is immersed in water or any aqueous solutions. The introduction of protecting groups stabilizes L&#8208;DOPA, preventing the oxidation of the catechol moiety and enhances the hydrophobicity, helping the removal of water from the surface to bind. These molecules show good adhesiveness, with different properties, so they may be all used as adhesives for different purposes. These outcomes pave the way for new set of applications for these materials as green and biocompatible adhesives.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The extension of the aromatic p&#8208;system of porphyrins is a powerful method to alter their optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
      <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.

      <dc:description>
  This minireview covers the know literature on [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of activated methylene isocyanides published since 2015. The review is divided into the three major parts that refer to the three heterocycles which can be prepared by reactions of isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  This review is devoted to the recent advances in the chemistry of methylene isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds. In this paper, we show a variety of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions for isocyanides, carried out both under catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic conditions. In addition, we also focused on diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity data.
