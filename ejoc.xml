      <title>Syntheses and applications of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles: A decade review</title>
      <dc:description>Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents as an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This thriving scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the enabling strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulphur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Oxidative and Redox&#8208;Neutral Approaches to Symmetrical Diamines and Diols by Single Electron Transfer/Hydrogen Atom Transfer Synergistic Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Homocoupling reactions of benzylamines and benzyl alcohols were examined under synergistic catalysis conditions with a photoredox catalyst and thiobenzoic acid as a hydrogen atom abstractor. When pivalaldehyde was used as an electron acceptor, oxidative dimerization proceeded selectively, whereas the use of benzaldehydes or iminium ions as electron acceptors resulted in redox&#8208;neutral coupling. These reactions afforded symmetrical 1,2&#8208;diamines and 1,2&#8208;diols in good yields.</dc:description>

These reactions afforded symmetrical 1,2&#8208;diamines and 1,2&#8208;diols in good yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Boc&#8208;protection on L&#8208;DOPA: an easy way to promote underwater adhesion</title>
      <dc:description>Mussels&#8217; ability to adhere to underwater surfaces has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. As proteins containing L&#8208;DOPA (3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine) are involved in mussels&#8217; adhesion, a common strategy to synthesize adhesives is the incorporation of this amino acid into other compounds. Here we report a study on four compounds of the family of Boc  x  &#8208;(L&#8208;DOPA)  n  &#8208;OMe (x = 1&#8208;3; n = 1,2), that we prepared through simple synthetic steps. Three of them showed the capability of underwater adhesion: while they are not adhesive in the dry phase, the adhesiveness is triggered when the dried sample is immersed in water or any aqueous solutions. The introduction of protecting groups stabilizes L&#8208;DOPA, preventing the oxidation of the catechol moiety and enhances the hydrophobicity, helping the removal of water from the surface to bind. These molecules show good adhesiveness, with different properties, so they may be all used as adhesives for different purposes. These outcomes pave the way for new set of applications for these materials as green and biocompatible adhesives.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Alkylation of Heteroaromatic Bases Using Ethyl Acetate as Alkylating Agent</title>
      <dc:description>
  The direct Csp2&#8208;Csp3 visible&#8208;light photoredox cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;heteroaromatics with ethyl acetate via the generation of 1&#8208;acetoxyethan&#8208;1&#8208;yl radical is reported. This approach also uncovers ethyl acetate as a cheap and non&#8208;conventional radical source in photoredox related organic synthesis.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An efficient room&#8208;temperature visible&#8208;light photoredox &#945;&#8208;acyloxyalkylation reaction of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, which relies on the use of ethyl acetate as a cheap and non&#8208;conventional radical source. The direct C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling was extended to a diverse set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tricyclic of N&#8208;heteroaromatics, and the optimized photoredox protocol was successfully performed on a multigram scale. The scope of the alkylating agent was also explored and a plausible mechanism was proposed, involving photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer and hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer processes.

      <title>Oxidative Cyclodehydrogenation Reactions with Tetraarylporphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>The extension of the aromatic p&#8208;system of porphyrins is a powerful method to alter their optoelectronic properties. Herein, aryl substituents were fused to porphyrin cores by Scholl oxidation reactions that selectively produced mono&#8208; and doubly&#8208;fused porphyrins in yields of up to 69&#160;%. Several different aryl substituents attached to the porphyrin were investigated with respect to their reactivity under Scholl conditions. The fused products were fully characterized,  i.e  ., by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, which showed drastic changes in the electronic features. Insight into the solid&#8208;state behavior was obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Our approach represents a novel option for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of porphyrin&#8208;based compounds.</dc:description>

Mechanism studies both by various NMR techniques and by theoretical calculations suggested two reaction pathways may be involved in the reaction which is dependent on the reaction media, that is, an eight&#8208;membered ring binding species may be formed in aqueous media between allylic alcohol, sulfinic acid and water, while a six&#8208; membered ring binding species may be formed in common aprotic organic solvent between allylic alcohol and sulfinic acid. Both two binding species may be account for the efficient activation of allylic alcohols  via  hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (S  N  Ar) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. At current, several &#8216;types&#8217; of S  N  Ar reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein we detail the reaction of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (S  N  Ar) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. At current, several &#8216;types&#8217; of S  N  Ar reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof.

      <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine Promoted Cascade Catalysis: A Tool for Complexity Generation</title>
      <dc:description>The bifunctional organocatalyst promoted, relay&#8208;cascade catalysis (use of a single catalyst capable of promoting each catalytic cycle in the designed cascade process) has been the hot area of research in recent times, as it enables the green synthesis of complex molecular architectures in an atom, cost and step&#8208;economic fashion. In this context we summarized the recent developments (for last fifteen years) in the area of the thiourea&#8211;  tert  &#8208;amine based cascade catalysis in the current review article. The discussion was divided into three subsections,  viz  . double&#8208;, triple&#8208; and quadruple cascades depending on the number of individual steps involved in the cascade process. In each type there are various combinations of reactions like Michael addition, aldol reaction, Henry reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, cyclization, trans&#8208;esterifications etc. Divergent polycyclic structural frameworks have been achieved employing this cascade catalytic strategy as evidenced in this review. We assume that the current review article would be a handle for the design and development as well as further growth of this potential greener approach.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>An efficient two&#8208;step strategy for the synthesis of constrained  C  &#8208;glycosyl amino acid derivatives from  C  &#8208;vinylglycosides involving a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using L&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;menthone&#8208;derived nitrone as key step is described. After optimization of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition conditions, various  C  &#8208;vinylglycosides were tested leading exclusively to one diastereoisomer of the corresponding cycloadduct in good to excellent yields. The total facial selectivity observed was also studied by DFT calculations. Original conformationally restricted  C  &#8208;glycosyl amino acid derivatives (8 examples) were isolated after simple cleavage of the chiral auxiliary.</dc:description>

      <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Styrene Hetero&#8208; and Homodimerization Initiation Proceeds with Two&#8208;Electron Reductive Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>A mechanistic insight into the hetero&#8208; and homodimerizations (HETD and HOMD) of styrenes promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents (HVIRs;  DMP  and  PIDA  ) and facilitated by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to yield all  trans  cyclobutanes is reported using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  The initialization involving direct bimolecular one&#8208;electron transfer is found to be highly unfavored, especially for the  PIDA  system. At this point, we suggest that the reaction is initiated with an overall two&#8208;electron reductive cleavage of two I&#9472;O bond cleavages, affording I(III) (iodinane) and I(I) (iodobenzene) product with DMP and PIDA as oxidant, respectively. The resulting acetate groups are stabilized by the solvent HFIP through strong hydrogen bonding interaction, which promotes the electron transfer process. The nature of the electron transfer is studied in detail and found that the overall two&#8208;electron transfer occurs within tri&#8208;molecular complex organized by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and as a stepwise and concerted mechanism for I(III) and I(V) oxidants, respectively. The reaction rate is determined by the initialization step: for I(III), the initiation is thermodynamically endergonic, whereas the endergonicity for I(V) is modest. Upon initialization, the reaction proceeds through a stepwise [2+2] pathway, involving a radical&#8208;cationic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked transition states, where the HOMD is dynamically competing pathway to HETD although the latter is relatively faster.</dc:description>

      <title>The Ugi three&#8208;component reaction; a valuable tool in modern organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The Ugi three component reaction (U&#8208;3CR) is a variation of the famous Ugi reaction, discovered almost 60 years ago. Today it is somehow neglected, compared to the classical variation, although the derived from the reaction &#945;&#8208;aminoamides have been utilized as inhibitors for various targets and even commercial drugs, offering improved pharmacokinetic properties. In this review, we are describing the scope and limitations of the reaction with a special focus on the developed catalytic protocols, the bioactive compounds and drugs which are based on the reaction and finally the post modifications that have been reported in order to access drug&#8208;like and privileged scaffolds. A special focus is given to the 3D solid state conformations of the U&#8208;3CR derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Diazanorbornene: A Valuable Synthon towards Carbocycles and Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Desymmetrization of meso compounds is well recognized as a powerful method for delivering biologically relevant molecular skeletons in a few synthetic steps. Heterobicyclic olefins are a class of meso compounds which exhibit exceptional reactivity due to its high ring strain originating from the unfavorable bond angles and eclipsing interactions. Extensive research was carried out towards the synthetic transformations of oxa&#8208;, aza&#8208; and diaza&#8208;norbornenes/ norbornadienes for the synthesis of a wide variety of carbocycles and heterocycles in a single step, most importantly in a stereo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner. This review summarizes the relevant aspects of diazanorbornene reactivity which will inspire the synthetic community for exploiting these highly strained bicyclic systems for the creation of extensive libraries of novel structurally and biologically interesting molecules. The review is divided into several sections based on the type of reactions that diazanorbornenes are subjected to.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The selective oxidation of different primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds by hydrogen peroxide was found to be catalysed in conversion ranging from good to excellent by an iron(III) complex of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand (Pc&#8208;L), without the need of any additive. The choice of the counteranion (Cl, Br, OTf) appeared to be of fundamental importance and the best results in terms of selectivity (up to 99%) and conversion (up to 98%) were obtained using the well characterised [Fe(III)(Br)2(Pc&#8208;L)]Br complex,  4c  . Magnetic moments in solid state, also confirmed in solution (d6  &#8208;DMSO) by Evans NMR method, were calculated and point out to an iron metal centre in the high spin state of 5/2. The crystal structure shows that the iron(III) centre is coordinated by the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle and two bromide anions to form a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in acetonitrile was found occurring with better conversions and selectivities than in other solvents. The reaction proved to be quite general, tolerating aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, although very low yields were obtained for terminal aliphatic alcohols. Preliminary mechanistic studies are in agreement with a catalytic cycle promoted by a high&#8208;spin iron complex.</dc:description>

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

     alt="Recent Advances in the Chemistry of Isocyanides with Activated Methylene Group"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This minireview covers the know literature on [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of activated methylene isocyanides published since 2015. The review is divided into the three major parts that refer to the three heterocycles which can be prepared by reactions of isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This review is devoted to the recent advances in the chemistry of methylene isocyanides with C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, and C=N bonds. In this paper, we show a variety of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions for isocyanides, carried out both under catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic conditions. In addition, we also focused on diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studies towards pyridine based N,N,O&#8208;gold(III) complexes synthesis, characterization and application.</title>
      <dc:description>Gold(III) coordination of new chiral polydentate (  N,)N,O  &#8208;pyridine based ligands is reported. Successful coordination afforded novel chiral  N,N,O  &#8208;tridentate Au(III) complexes with the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;6&#8208;(  1S,2S,5R  )&#8208;neomenthol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;pyridine ligand (  1  H,  13  C,  15  N NMR, HRMS, IR, XRD).&#160;The chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;6&#8208;alkylpyridine alcohol ligands were prepared from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine by initial stereoselective addition to (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;camphor, respectively, and subsequent Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling with a series arylboronic acids. Testing of catalytic activity in propargyl cyclopropanation demonstrated that the new  N,N,O  &#8208;ligated gold(III) complex was highly catalytic active and outperformed AuCl  3  .</dc:description>
