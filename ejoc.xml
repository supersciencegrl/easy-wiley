         <title>The Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction in Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 6, February 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties of tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) can be tailored by changing the substitution pattern at the aryl moiety. In addition, their properties can be &#8220;fine&#8208;tuned&#8221; by changing the length of the alkyl group. In this work, TAAILs are successfully used as a reaction medium for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction using different aryl bromides and styrene derivatives.







Abstract
We report the use of imidazolium based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) as solvents in the Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction. Different commercially available palladium sources, inorganic bases, TAAILs and reaction conditions were tested for the synthesis of trans&#8208;stilbene using bromobenzene and styrene. A variety of different stilbene derivatives were synthesized with exclusive formation of the (E)&#8208;isomers and isolated yields up to 97&#8201;%. We were able to optimize the reaction conditions using only 0.25&#8197;mol% of Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst and a reaction time of 4&#8197;hours. No additional ligands or additives are used in the reaction. The catalytic system using TAAILs achieved higher yields than commercially available imidazolium and phosphonium ionic liquids, demonstrating the potential of tailored ionic liquids as a reaction medium for the Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction.

         <title>The First Total Synthesis of Racemic Chebulic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 6, February 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key steps of the total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid are a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester and a cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of the respective intermediate product to the &#948;&#8208;lactone structure.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid is reported, which is the aglycon of several antioxidant ingredients of the fruit of the Terminalia chebula tree. The route started with the straightforward preparation of an indanone&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;oxoester from a benzaldehyde derivative (84&#8201;% over the first five steps). The side chain of the target compound was then introduced by conjugated addition of a cuprate reagent derived from dimethyl succinate, which was followed by the first key step of the synthesis: a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester. The second key step was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester to a &#948;&#8208;lactone. Finally, chebulic acid was obtained after six&#8208;fold demethylation of three methyl ester moieties and three phenolic ether functions. The overall synthetic route consists of nine consecutive steps and was accomplished in 15&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>From Biomass to the Karrikins via Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Hemicellulose&#8208;Derived Butyl Xylosides and Glucosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective catalytic oxidation of monosaccharides was applied to butyl xylosides and butyl glucosides leading to the formation of bioactive karrikins, molecules that are important in the response to catastrophic fires. Butanosolv processing of biomass provides a co&#8208;product stream that contains these starting materials providing relevance to this work in the biorefinery context.







Abstract
Members of the karrikin family of bioactive small molecules are known to promote germination of a range of plants following large scale fires. As a result, they are relevant and interesting compounds. This report describes their synthesis from a biomass&#8208;derived product stream. During work to fractionate biomass with the goal of obtaining high quality lignins, an interesting co&#8208;product stream derived from the hemicellulose in the biomass, was obtained. Whilst many applications of this co&#8208;product stream can be proposed, in this case the major monosaccharides have been converted to relevant karrikins in short reaction sequences. Key results include a highly selective catalytic oxidation reaction, conversion of the resulting ketone to a butenolide by two alternative approaches, a selective acetal reductive opening reaction, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two compounds and detailed comparison of the final products with previous literature reports. Only through successful use of all the components generated during biomass refining, can economic sustainability be potentially achieved.

         <title>Synthetic Study of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural in Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of renewable 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural as the aldehyde component in the GBB multicomponent reaction was explored. Mild conditions and short reaction times were achieved to obtain new imidazoheterocycles with good selectivity. A small compound library based on the optimized conditions was built to exemplify the scope.







Abstract
In the present study, we explored the reactivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF), a renewable platform chemical, as the aldehyde component in the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) multicomponent reaction. Given the limited stability of 5&#8208;HMF under conventional conditions used for this reaction, acidic milieu in combination with high temperature or long reaction times, we explored factors which influence the course of the reaction (solvent, catalyst, time, and temperature) within the guidelines of previously reported green reaction conditions. Mild conditions and short reaction times were achieved to obtain good conversion and selectivity values. The reaction scope was exemplified by preparing a small compound library based on the optimized conditions varying the amidine and the isocyanide component. The hydroxymethylfuran moiety present in the GBB products, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles, provides useful functionalization for further transformations, which could expand the diversity of the chemical space.

The hydroxymethylfuran moiety present in the GBB products, imidazo[1,2-a]heterocycles, provides useful functionalization for further transformations, which could expand the diversity of the chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Black swan in phase transfer catalysis: influence of mixing mode on the stereoselectivity of glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transfer catalysis (PTC) is widely used for the preparation of anomerically pure aryl glycosides by glycosylation of phenols with glycosyl halides. Here, we attempted to synthesize 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenyl (CPP) sialoside &#8211; a useful Janus glycoside for neoglycoconjugate synthesis. A  batch  glycosylation reaction under typical PTC conditions (  N  &#8208;acetylsialyl chloride, 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenol, Bu  4  NHSO  4  , AcOEt, 10% aq Na  2  CO  3  ) resulted in formation of CPP sialoside as a  single  anomer, albeit in low yield. Conversely, the PT&#1057; glycosylation  in flow  using Comet X&#8208;01 micromixer doubled the yield of CPP sialoside, which was obtained as a  mixture  of anomers suggesting the change in the reaction mechanism apparently induced by the change in mixing mode. An increase in flow rate led to further loss of stereoselectivity while the use of T&#8208;shaped mixer increased stereoselectivity. Similar results were obtained for  N  ,  N  &#8208;diacetylsialyl chloride and two other  para&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;substituted phenols suggesting generality of the discovered phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N3&#8208;Directed C&#8208;H Halogenation of N9&#8208;Arylpurines and Azapurines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct  ortho&#8208;  halogenation of  N  9  &#8208;arylpurines was developed by using  N  &#8208;halogenated succinimide (NBS/NCS/NIS) as the halogenation reagents (Br/Cl/I). The current procedure offers a late&#8208;stage strategy to generate  N  9  &#8208;(  ortho  &#8208;haloaryl)purines in moderate to excellent yields. The protocol was applicable to the substrates with both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents and only monohalogenated products were formed.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Intramolecular Formal Enyne&#8208;Metathesis &#8211; An Alternative to Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greener catalyst, greener solvent: Energy&#8208;transfer process enabled by an organocatalyst (4CzIPN) and using dimethylcarbonate as solvent offers a more sustainable alternative protocol for the formal enyne&#8208;metathesis of 1,7&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
A new approach to access 1,3&#8208;diene derived quinolinone compounds has been realized using a mild reaction protocol employing a metal free catalyst (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) (4CzIPN), blue LED as activation source, and benefits from a sustainable solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The mechanism is postulated as an amide&#8208;tethered enyne intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;photocatalyzed cycloaddition&#8208;retrocycloaddition sequence, proceeding via a cyclobutene intermediate species. The methodology offers an efficient route towards decorated 1,3&#8208;diene products.

         <dc:description>A simple salt free and selective N &#8208;allylation of indoles with allylic alcohols has been developed. The protocol uses a catalytic amount of a nickel complex generated in situ from Ni(cod) 2 and dppf as diphosphine.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two distinct and concise syntheses of zephycandidine A (  1  ) from readily available starting materials are reported. In the first, the imidazole derived from piperonal (  7a  ) was subjected to reaction with  o  &#8208;bromoiodobenzene or the corresponding di&#8208;iodide in the presence of Pd[0] and thereby forming,  via  Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Heck reactions, a mixture of target  1  and regio&#8208;isomer  10  . These products could only be separated from one another by HPLC. A lower yielding but completely regioselective synthesis of zephycandidine A (  1  ) was achieved by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of the imidazole,  6b  , derived from the bromopiperonal  7b  with  o  &#8208;iodophenylboronic acid (  5d  ). Preliminary biological screening of compounds  1  ,  10  and certain precursors reveal that some possess anti&#8208;viral properties but, contrary to expectations, are not notable inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoprostanoids, Isofuranoids and Isoketals &#8211; From Synthesis to Lipidomics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated fatty acid metabolites are known as isoprostanoids, isofuranoids and isoketals. These metabolites are formed under oxidative stress and have many biological roles (e.&#8201;g., biomarkers, bioactivity). This Review discusses the main chemical strategies for their synthesis as well as the analytical methods to quantify them in biological samples.







Abstract
A huge diversity of oxygenated metabolites originated from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had been discovered. Radical cascades are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites, and the radical initiation can be performed either inside the active site of an enzyme in the extracellular medium, or in membrane on phospholipids. The development of convergent and flexible chemical strategies to prepare these compounds by organic chemists, along with the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods, has boosted the knowledge regarding PUFA metabolites. Also, isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment. This Review provides a brief overview on the chemical strategies and analytical methods achieved over the past thirty years.

         <title>Azoliums and Ag(I)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Thioglycosides: synthesis, reactivity and bioactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A versatile protocol for the synthesis of azolium thioglycosides is reported. This protocol is based on a PdG3&#8208;catalyzed Migita cross&#8208;coupling between p&#8208;di&#8208;iodo azoliums and protected or unprotected &#946;&#8211;1&#8208;thioglucose partners. Moreover, a solvent&#8208;free mechanochemistry approach was developed as a unique access to the corresponding Ag(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene thioglycosides. Finally, chemical reactivity and antiproliferative bioactivity were examined with azoliums and Ag(I)&#8208;NHC thioglycosides. This study demonstrates a promising potential of these newly synthesized carbohydrate&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H Functionalization: An Alternative Strategic Access to Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmental pollution and safety hazards during the development of chemical pharmacy have caused much concern. The spring up of mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H functionalization provided an attractive alternative for the green synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and bioactive compounds. The advances of these enabling mechanochemical strategies and future perspectives are summarized in this review.







Abstract
In the pursuit of clean pharmaceutical production, chemists in medicinal industry require access to new sustainable methodologies to reduce and even eliminate pollution, which is mainly produced by the overuse of organic solvents during chemical synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In this context, the solvent&#8208;free/less mechanochemical functionalization of small molecules has gradually emerged as a powerful strategy for the green synthesis and modification of APIs, bioactive compounds, and functional materials. In this review, we present an overview of mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H functionalization applications to medicinal chemistry, involving cross&#8208;coupling, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, oxidative coupling (via C&#8722;H activation pathway), and direct coupling (via radical pathway) as key steps for the preparation of APIs and bioactive compounds.

         <title>A Hexagonal Shape&#8208;Persistent Nanobelt of Elongated Rhombic Symmetry with Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;Planes by a One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>

One ring in one&#8208;pot: Macrocyclization in one step gives the shape&#8208;persistent belt&#8208;like structure besides undefined oligomers, which can easily be separated.







Abstract
Triptycenes with their predefined D3h&#8208;symmetry are excellent molecular building blocks to construct shape&#8208;persistent nanobelts having &#960;&#8208;orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane. However, up to now, there are only a very few examples of fused and rigid iptycene nanobelts synthesized in several consecutive steps in overall yields below 1&#8201;%. Here we present the simple one&#8208;step one&#8208;pot approach to an iptycene nanobelt, which forms in &gt;2&#8201;% and can readily be isolated from the polymeric by&#8208;product by gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.

         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach for the functionalization of substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) was developed. The system combines monoamine oxidase (MAO)&#8208;catalyzed imine formation with Ugi&#8208;type three&#8208;component reaction in an aqueous buffer without intermediate isolation. The two steps were separately optimized for buffer and pH to obtain the expected products. MAOs enabled the functionalization of fifteen THIQs by oxidation to imines, while the Ugi&#8208;Joulli&#233;&#8208;reaction was successfully carried out with eight carboxylic acids and eight isonitriles. 41 products were isolated giving access to valuable building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyranocyclopentaindolines Representing the Western Sections of Janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and Shearinine&#8197;G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of pyranocyclopentaindolines: Tetracycles representing the ABCD partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G were synthesized starting from indoline. The hydroxylated western section of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.

         <title>Acylation of Hexaphenylbenzene for the Synthesis of [5]Cumulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaphenylbenzene is appended to [5]cumulenes, a marriage of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;carbon building blocks for synthetic allotropes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of hexaphenylbenzene is reported, and the reaction favorably provides the monoacylated products 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b. The resulting ketones 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b are used as precursors for the formation of [5]cumulenes, including 6&#8201;b in which the sterically demanding HPB moiety affords a diethynyl[5]cumulene that features significant stability (persistence) versus the analog 6&#8201;c which lacks the HPB endgroups. The unsymmetrical substitution pattern of the two most soluble derivatives 6&#8201;b and 6&#8201;c, allows for estimation of rotational barriers for diethynyl[5]cumulenes via VT NMR studies of cis&#8208;trans isomerization. For both molecules, the barrier to rotation is ca. 15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is attenuated in comparison to other [5]cumulenes due to the presence of the ethynyl endgroups.

The resulting ketones &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; are used as precursors for the formation of [5]cumulenes, including &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; in which the sterically demanding HPB moiety affords a diethynyl[5]cumulene that features significant stability (persistence) versus the analog &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; which lacks the HPB endgroups. The unsymmetrical substitution pattern of the two most soluble derivatives &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, allows for estimation of rotational barriers for diethynyl[5]cumulenes via VT NMR studies of &lt;i&gt;cis-trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization. For both molecules, the barrier to rotation is ca. 15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is attenuated in comparison to other [5]cumulenes due to the presence of the ethynyl endgroups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silk&#8722;Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8722;fibroin&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) was successfully applied in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides. Structural investigation of Pd/SF by WAXS analysis, together with the help of a computational model, supported the hypothesis of catalytic pockets where monoatomic Pd species can form stable complexes with SF.







Abstract
Recently, we have reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15&#8197;&#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.

         <dc:description>Following a concept of&#160;Hergenrother (Nature&#160; 2017 , 545 , 299) we addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic&#160;natural products can be converted into more potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. Phenolic mono&#8208; and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7&#8208;hydroxycalamenene) as well as the diterpenes 7&#8208;hydroxy&#173;erogor&#173;giaene and 9&#8208;deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A were converted into amino&#8208;functionalized analogs, that display either an amino&#8208;methyl or a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;ethoxy substituent, &#160;by Pd&#8208;catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O &#8208;alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile/reduction, or by ortho &#8208;hydroxymethylation/amination. An efficient enantio&#173;selective total synthesis of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#173;erogorgiaene (8 steps, 29% overall yield) and 9&#8208;deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A (9 steps, 30% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric Co&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation (91% ee ) of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene as the chirogenic step. Other C&#8208;C bond forming steps include a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling and diastereo&#173;selective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and tested for their antibacterial properties. Some diterpene&#8208;derived amines showed high efficacy against Gram&#8208;positive ( S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC = 0.5 to 2 &#181;g/ml) and&#160;Gram&#8208;negative bacteria&#160;( E. coli K12; E. coli I&#8208;11276b; MIC = 8 to 32 &#181;g/ml).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations into Supramolecular Lyotropic Liquid Crystals based on 1,3,5&#8208;Benzenetricarboxaramides by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New supramolecular lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) based on 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) with  n  &#8208;alkylaniline sidechains are described. Using NMR spectroscopy we investigate the effects of different chain lengths along the homologous series and of non&#8208;BTA additives on liquid crystalline behaviour. From this, we attempt to answer two questions: First, how aliphatic chain length and the addition of further aromatic rings affect the self&#8208;assembly process in general and compared to previously reported systems with purely aliphatic sidechains. Second, whether or not these modifications are suitable to increases the resulting LLC phases&#8217; resilience against disrupting effects of further, non&#8208;BTA additives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The regioselective ring&#8208;opening of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;sulfamidates with fluorine anion is reported. Direct construction of monofluoro&#8208;substituted amines and amino acid derivatives using inexpensive and easily available potassium fluoride(KF). The monofluorination process only need 35 minutes under heating, which will be an attractive route for the synthesis of the PET fluorine&#8208;18 radiotracer. The application of the product can be extended to the construction of fluorinated polypeptides after simple deprotection treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing medicinally relevant O&#8208;benzofused heterocycles through C&#8208;X activation: Recent trends</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present review, we address the recent advances in the elaboration of medicinally relevant oxygen benzofused heterocycles by palladium and copper assisted C&#8208;X activation of halo arene precursors. This attractive transformation has shown remarkable versatility and efficiency as a synthetic toolkit leading to the construction of numerous scaffolds with high structural diversity in an atom&#8208;economical manner. We covered recent examples that considered the application of this strategy using miscellaneous coupling partners and conditions. The halo arene motif has proven to be a brilliant candidate principally due to its availability and cost, and in this review, we showcase relevant and appropriate examples of its use in catalytic reactions leading to medicinally important targets.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A unified approach for the first enantioselective total synthesis of magnoshinin and merrilliaquinone is reported. The key features of the synthesis are the DDQ assisted chemoselective late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization of the polyoxygenated chiral tetralin core accessed by utilizing the relayed asymmetric induction strategy. Then, the follow&#8208;up of chemoselective redox chemistry facilitates the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin (28.2% overall yield) and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone (20.6% overall yield) along the shortest route, starting from the known 3&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heck coupling has emerged as an effective and powerful tool for C&#8208;C bond formations, with applications in academic and industrial grounds. The conventional Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction employed expensive Pd based catalysts, however, developments to meet low&#8208;cost replacements to Pd is relevant from a sustainable point of view. Heck&#8208;type couplings involving cost&#8208;effective transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu has been established in the recent decades. Herein, we have comprehended the developments in low&#8208;cost transition metal catalyzed Heck couplings covering the literature from 2016.</dc:description>

         <title>Manifestations of Antiaromaticity in Organic Materials: Case Studies of Cyclobutadiene, Borole, and Pentalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern synthetic strategies have enabled the proliferation of seemingly unstable antiaromatic species into several molecular and materials applications. These destabilizing moieties offer a unique way of tuning the electronic properties of organic materials. In this Review, the history, synthetic strategies, and applications of important conjugated building blocks based upon the antiaromatic cores of cyclobutadiene, borole and pentalene are explored.







Abstract
This Review surveys the experimental and synthetic history of three classic antiaromatic cores: cyclobutadiene, borole, and pentalene. The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformation (CIDT) of a a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide is reported. This process provided an enantiopure stereolabile &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, which after diastereoselective carbonyl group reduction led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with excellent diastereoselectivities. These bromohydrins can be used as precursors for the synthesis of enantiopure 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl)piperidines. The utility of this methodology was illustrated by the diastereodivergent synthesis of hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine.







Abstract
Diastereodivergent syntheses of the enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine are reported. Our approach relies on efficient Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of an epimeric mixture of a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, that provided a stable &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, and diastereoselective &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide reduction that led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with high level of asymmetric induction.

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium (II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single metal&#8208;catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, p&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient approach to saccharin&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;DHPs has been established via [3 + 3] annulation process. The chemical event was enabled by a Et  3  N&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael/aza&#8208;Pinner reaction of alkyl cyclic  N  &#8208;sulfonyl ketimine as nucleophile with  &#945;,&#945;  &#8208;dicyanoolefins. Under mild conditions, the desired products were readily prepared in good to excellent yields with broad functional group tolerance (up to 95% yield, 29&#160;examples). Notably, this practical methodology features the synthesis of pentacyclic spirooxindoles bearing a quaternary spiro&#8208;stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, we described the efficient enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic diastereocontrolled secondary alcohols bearing a quaternary stereocenter using a commercially available chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. This methodology is a general KR leading to the enantiocontrol of acyclic quaternary stereocenter with high levels of stereoselectivity (s up to 185) on a large scope. The hydroxyl function can easily serve as a traceless group by oxidation or reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;catalytic enantioselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diols containing a tetrasubstituted fluorinated stereocenter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective construction of fluorohydrins featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter embedded in complex frameworks represents an important challenge. Herein, we report a multicatalytic strategy enabling the stereoselective preparation of a new type of scaffold containing such challenging fluorohydrin motif. The sequence is based on an organocatalyzed fluorination of &#945;&#8208;disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction. Reduction of the generated b&#8208;hydroxy ketone followed by a Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution enables the isolation of original fluorinated 1,3&#8208;diols with perfect diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis of ferrocene (Fc) conjugated selenopeptides using a new modified solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) protocol and study their self&#8208;assembled nanostructure formation into spheres, nanofibers and nanotubes. We have successfully synthesized four selenopeptide conjugates: two containing both selenocysteine (Sec) and Fc; the rest have either one of the units. These molecules are well&#8208;characterized with various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR. The importance of Fc unit, aromatic moieties and weak intermolecular interactions on the self&#8208;assembled process is revealed by systematic morphological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the combination of DABCO and acetic acid under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction rate of both activated and non&#8208;activated aldehydes increased significantly. The disclosed procedure is operationally simple and is compatible with a wide array of both nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction has been stablished as an important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transformation between carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and activated olefins. However, the slow reaction rate usually observed with electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners hinders a more widespread use of this reaction. In order to overcome this drawback, the effects of several Br&#248;nsted acids on the rate of DABCO&#8208;catalyzed MBH reactions were evaluated. The protocol is operationally simple, involving neat and open&#8208;flask conditions, and is compatible with a wide range of reagents. We suggest a general acid catalysis mechanism to be responsible for the rate increase. The synthetic versatility of the MBH adducts is exemplified with a two&#8208;steps diastereoselective synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;sitophilure. We hope this acid&#8208;mediated protocol to have potential use as a general methodology for the MBH reaction.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade and Divergent Synthesis of Indolobenzazepines and Indoloquinolines from Nitrogen&#8208;Tethered 1,8&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade hydroamination and cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes proceeded by cationic Au(I) catalysts. The divergent synthesis of indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines and indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was achieved by the choice of phosphine ligands. The fluorescent aza[6]helicene could also be prepared by this protocol.







Abstract
We describe the divergent construction of two nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic systems by gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerizations. The gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade hydroamination and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes yielded indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines in one pot. In contrast, when Johnphos&#8208;coordinated gold catalyst was used, the same 1,8&#8208;diynes were transformed into indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization along with rearrangement of the substituent on one of the alkynes. The reaction of a naphthalene&#8208;tethered substrate provided a helically chiral aza[6]helicene.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Silylation of Diarylmethyl Carbonates with Silylboranes under Base&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions, and the corresponding benzylic silanes are formed in good to high yields. The obtained benzyl silane derivatives can work as the benzylic nucleophiles by the action of a suitable fluoride source and react with some carbon electrophiles to deliver the corresponding benzylic C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupled products. Additionally, while still preliminary, the allylic silylation of the isoelectronic allylic carbonates is also achieved.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to high&#8208;spin molecules with a ferrocenophane core is proposed based on the reaction of intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bis(carbodiimide) derivatives formed by the stepwise reaction of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with organic isocyanates. The direction of [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is controlled by substituents in the isocyanates, thereby offering an excellent tool for the creating weakly coupled diradicals.







Abstract
This paper describes the stepwise aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with a paramagnetic isocyanate, namely, 3&#8208;isocyanato&#8208;2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl, and then with substituted arylisocyanates. The intermediate product (a paramagnetic betaine), which is the product of an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom of the iminophosphorane moiety on the carbon atom of the carbodiimide functional group, was isolated and structurally characterized. Subsequent interaction of the betaine with arylisocyanates under mild conditions gave spin&#8208;labeled ferrocenophanes with the 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimine coupler. It was found that the mutual arrangement of the substituents in the latter depends on the nature of the substituents in the arylisocyanate. Iodophenyl derivatives of 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimines were cross&#8208;coupled with the gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex, thus yielding diradicals: metallocenophanes functionalized with various types of nitroxide substituents. Molecular and crystal structures of all mono&#8208; and diradicals were solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidates as an Modular Conjugation Platform to Generate Multi&#8208;Functional Protein&#8208; and Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates</title>

         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate building blocks were used for a chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row to facilitate a simple protocol for the construction of protein&#8208;protein conjugates and homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs). A third chemoselective modification step allows a highly modular assembly that yields homogeneous and precise Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugates (ADFCs).







Abstract
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidates allow for a simple chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row. We describe four such bis&#8208;electrophiles that carry different functional O&#8208;substituents with tunable hydrophilicity and enable further subsequent conjugations, thus facilitating a simple protocol for constructing protein&#8208;protein conjugates. An increased spacer length between the two ethynylphosphonamidates simplifies the formation of a conjugate from two bulky proteins. We apply these reagents to obtain homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs) from DM1 and trastuzumab with excellent cytotoxicity and selectivity for the targeted cell line. Moreover, a bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate, carrying an additional alkyne for a chemoselective triple conjugation, has been subjected to fluorescent labeling of an ADC specifically at the drug site give an Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugate (ADFC), allowing for the observation of intracellular trafficking after ADC uptake into the targeted cell.

         <title>Theoretical Study on Si&#8210;Cl Bond Activation in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Chlorosilanes with Organoaluminum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of chlorosilanes has recently emerged as an efficient method for the synthesis of organic silicon compounds. Direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation by transition metals is a key elementary reaction in these methods. This theoretical study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the strong Si&#8210;Cl bond in Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction to gain insights for rational catalyst design. Our results suggest two plausible pathways for the bond activation: (i)  trans  &#8208;oxidative addition and (ii) S  N  2&#8208;type oxidative addition assisted by a Lewis acid. With an increase in Cl substituents of chlorosilanes,  trans  &#8208;oxidative becomes highly feasible due to their higher Lewis acidities, in which the facile formation of the Pd&#8594;Si interaction enables the smooth activation of the Si&#8210;Cl bond. The general mechanism of direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation presented here may prove useful for the rational design of catalysis in the future.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organoboronates are synthetically useful and highly valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Two&#8208;electron reactions allow for the rapid construction of organoboronates via nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;boron shift of boron ate complexes or MIDA&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;boryl migration. Radical approaches through 1,2&#8208;boron shift of neutral boronic esters or boron ate complexes have been demonstrated to be feasible, providing complementary methods to access these privileged scaffolds. In this minireview, we highlight recent achievements and discuss future opportunities, with an emphasis on different operative modes of catalysis and reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing polycyclic natural products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffold construction via stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of chiral hydrindanes and their boron complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral  trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic  endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas &#8232;thermal conditions provided the  endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial &#8232;selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#183;OEt2  into &#8232;BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave  endo  /  exo  &#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the  endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the &#8232;reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;reactions with furan gave furyl&#8208;substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Asymmetric Organo&#8208; and Biocatalysis in Flow Processes and Comparison with their Analogous Batch Syntheses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequential&#8208;type as well as a tandem&#8208;type chemoenzymatic flow cascade combining an organocatalytic aldol reaction and a biocatalytic reduction to form stereoselectively a 1,3&#8208;diol with two stereogenic centers were developed. Initially, a comprehensive screening of 24 alcohol dehydrogenases was carried out and the identified candidates were applied in different multi&#8208;step flow cascades. All four stereoisomers of the desired 1,3&#8208;diol product are accessible  via  a sequential flow approach with product formation&#8208;related conversions of up to 76% over two steps, isolated yields of up to 64% and enantiomeric excess of &gt;99% in all cases. In addition, a tandem&#8208;type flow process, performing both reaction steps simultaneously, was established leading to 51% conversion with &gt;99%  ee  and 8:1 d.r. and representing a combination of the fields of asymmetric chemocatalysis, biocatalysis and flow chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via side&#8208;chain anchoring of the ornithine &#948;&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides represent a popular class of macrocyclic drug candidates and therefore their solid phase synthesis has attracted much attention. In this contribution we present an efficient method of side&#8208;chain anchoring for ornithine and lysine residues to be used in the standard Fmoc&#8208;based synthesis of cyclic peptides via on&#8208;resin cyclization. We demonstrate that the side chain of ornithine and lysine protected with  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;group can efficiently be converted to the isocyanate which is then immobilized on Wang&#8208;type resin in almost quantitative yield. We further show the synthesis of four biologically active cyclic peptides employing the side chain ornithine anchoring. Our method is at least on a par with the previously reported methodologies in terms of yield and the purity of the final products and is arguably operationally more straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 6&#8208;Purinylmagnesium Halides in Dichloromethane: Scope and New Insights into the Solvent Influence on the C&#8722;Mg Bond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly functionalized purine systems were obtained using aldehydes and, for the first time, ketones through a recently developed iodo&#8208;Mg exchange methodology that works in DCM. DFT calculations suggested that the observed major stability of the C&#8722;Mg bond generated in DCM at higher temperature compared to the one in THF might be derived from a less polar character of the C&#8722;Mg bond in such non&#8208;coordinating solvent.







Abstract
The generation of positionally stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl magnesium halides is complicated by the often very rapid isomerization to give the 8&#8208;yl Grignards. By conducting the reaction in dichloromethane (DCM), we demonstrated that the anion isomerization can be stopped and these stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl Grignards react directly with a broad scope of aldehydes in good yields. Furthermore, purine functionalization with ketones has been achieved for the first time in the presence of LaCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Density functional theory calculations offer a possible explanation of the special role played by solvent in this chemistry and show that in DCM the C&#8722;Mg bond has a less polar character, whereas in THF it is predominantly ionic and much more basic in nature.

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Proving Syntheses of the Polyenoyltetramic Acids Pyranonigrin J and I</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants, Which Circumvent a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis in the Sequel</title>

         <dc:description>A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;sty&#173;rene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12).

This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused octa&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7a&#8208;b and 9a&#8208;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing meta&#173;theses pro&#173;vided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8a&#8208;b and 10a&#8208;c. Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a&#8208;disubstituted (in 8a&#8208;b) or a&#8208;monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a&#8208;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone &#8208; or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone &#8208; 6a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7&#8208;benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3.

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

Thiourea derivatives bearing both saturated and unsaturated NHCs were obtained using NEt  3  as a weak base (homogeneous setup) in conjunction with a bed of elemental sulfur (S  8  ).

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
