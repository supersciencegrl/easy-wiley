         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Thiols with BrCCl3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of thiol was promoted by BrCCl3 in THF. This catalyst&#8208; and metal&#8208;free method was used to synthesize disulfides under mild conditions. The clean reaction minimized the possibility of contamination of the product.







Abstract
This paper reported a catalyst&#8208; and metal&#8208;free method to construct disulfide bond with BrCCl3 under light irradiation. This clean and mild reaction promoted the oxidative coupling of thiols with wide substrate scope, and is applicable to benzylic, aryl and aliphatic thiols, especially cysteine derivative. The disulfides were obtained in high yields up to 98&#8201;%, avoiding the use of heating, strong oxidant, metal reagent or catalyst. This facile strategy will facilitate the synthesis of disulfide compounds.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis and Chemoinformatics: A Fruitful Synergy towards Better Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In these two decades, Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis (DOS) has changed significantly: from the historical focus on structural diversity, new approaches have been developed in order to increase the biological outcome of the molecules within the library, such as the privileged&#8208;based DOS or the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Fluorescence Library Approach (DOFLA). In this context, chemoinformatics can assist organic chemists in identifying biologically&#8208;relevant regions of the chemical space not yet explored. Also, chemoinformatics tools can be used to graphically visualize and/or predict the structural diversity and complexity of the compounds within the library. This review highlights the improvement that DOS has received from chemoinformatics, presenting recent articles (published between 2016 and 2021) in which DOS libraries are analysed by chemoinformatics tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Analytical Evaluation of Fsp3&#8208;Inspired Raman Probes for Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fraction of sp  3&#160;&#8208;hybdrised carbons (Fsp  3  ) in drug candidates and other biologically relevant compounds has been proposed to be an important physicochemical consideration within medicinal chemistry. Currently available small&#8208;molecule probes for Raman imaging are not optimised for biological applications. We sought to improve upon the highly Raman&#8208;active, yet rigid, lipophilic, and aggregative, bisarylbutadiyne (BADY) motif by introducing Fsp  3  character. BADY analogues were designed, efficiently synthesised, and analysed by mass spectrometry &#8211; revealing a statistical correlation between compound aggregation and cLog  P  , but no correlation with sp  3  . However, X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrated that the modifications to the BADY structure had a marked effect on crystal packing, suggesting Fsp  3  may still be important in reducing intermolecular stacking, and thus aggregation, of BADY. Cellular imaging by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allowed comparison of the intracellular distribution of the tags, guiding the design of future Raman probes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) was synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment ( &#956;  0  ) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (  Ea  ), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;  0  and a lowering of the  Ea  value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8208;30 kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment  .</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugation of Carbohydrates with Quinolines: A Powerful Synthetic Tool</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of carbohydrates with quinolines is an useful strategy to improve the bioactivity profile of the quinoline scaffold. This Review discusses the synthetic efforts to access these valuable molecules and the isolation of glycoquinolines from natural sources in the period 2000&#8211;2021. In addition, the bioactivity profiles and potential therapeutic uses of these compounds are presented.







Abstract
A detailed revision on natural and synthetic glycosylated quinolines, spanning the last 20&#8197;years, is presented. Exhaustive descriptions about the state of the art of the synthesis and relevant applications of these glyco&#8208;heterocycles are provided. In addition, an account of the natural products containing this motif and their associated bioactivity data are also outlined. For the sake of consistency, quinolones are also covered as well as hybrid compounds, embodied with linkers between the heterocyclic ring and the carbohydrate fragment.

         <title>Synergistic Dual Amine/Transition Metal Catalysis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic dual amine/transition metal catalysis has enabled chemists to plan and realise a plethora of organic transformations unachievable by traditional catalysis, breaking grounds in the functionalisation of carbonyl compounds. The ability of both transition metal catalysis and aminocatalysis to manipulate the stereochemical space has been virtuously integrated by many to achieve an array of stereodivergent syntheses. This Review serves as a comprehensive collection of synergistic dual amine/transition metal catalysis over the past decade.







Abstract
Dual Catalysis has enabled a plethora of novel unconventional transformations that would have been unattainable by either catalyst alone. The enormous potential of dual catalysis hinges on the synergistic activation of two substrates in discrete catalytic cycles without interfering with one another. The last decade had witnessed diverse dual&#8208;catalyst systems focusing mainly on the combination of transition metal catalysis with either one of Lewis acid catalysis, photoredox catalysis, biocatalysis or organocatalysis (i.&#8201;e., Lewis bases, Br&#248;nsted acids and NHC catalysts). In this setting, the scientific community has greatly embraced the integration of amine catalysts with transition metal catalysts. This Review comprehends the reported examples from the past decade on dual amine/transition metal catalysis and discuss the various activation modes for the functionalisation of carbonyl compounds.

         <title>A Unified Strategy for the Synthesis of Natural Products Containing &#948;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208; Lactones through a Photoredox ATRA Reaction.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of five natural products bearing hydroxylactones were accomplished. The basic reaction consisted in a photoredox&#8208;free radical iodolactonization, leading to a common iodolactone that could be derivatized in different final structures.







Abstract
A unified strategy for the synthesis of natural products containing &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones as the main core is reported. This strategy is based on a photocatalyzed radical ionic sequence for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones. Depending on the necessities of the synthetic targets, the reaction conditions can be adjusted to access a diastereoisomeric mixture or a single diasteroisomer of the lactones. Also, &#948;&#8208;lactones can be prepared by this method. The utility of this procedure was demonstrated by the total synthesis of five natural products.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8211;activity studies produced a new near infrared cyanine heptamethine molecular probe that is rapidly activated by nitroreductase enzyme to give &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence that can penetrate thick biological tissue.







Abstract
Two new classes of near&#8208;infrared molecular probes were prepared and shown to exhibit &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence when cleaved by the nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of cell hypoxia. The fluorescent probes are heptamethine cyanine dyes with a central 4&#8216;&#8208;carboxylic ester group on the heptamethine chain that is converted by a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism to a 4&#8216;&#8208;caboxylate group that greatly enhances the fluorescence brightness. Each compound was prepared by ring opening of a Zincke salt. The chemical structures have either terminal benzoindolinenes or propargyloxy auxochromes, which provide favorable red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission wavelengths and a hyperchromic effect that enhances the photon output when excited by 808&#8197;nm light. A fluorescent probe with terminal propargyloxy&#8208;indolenines exhibited less self&#8208;aggregation and was rapidly activated by nitroreductase with large &#8220;turn on&#8220; fluorescence; thus, it is the preferred choice for translation towards in&#8197;vivo applications.

         <title>Vibrational and Electronic Circular Dichroism Study of Chiral Seleno Compounds Prepared from a Naphthol Based Diselenide</title>

         <dc:description>
1,1&#8217;&#8208;diselanediylbis(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol) is prepared starting from &#946;&#8208;naphthol via an electrophilic aromatic substitution. Its full characterization by NMR and X&#8208;Ray analysis and some synthetic manipulations are here discussed. Novel chiral selenium containing heterocycles were obtained and the absolute configuration was investigated using (for the first time, on organoselenium derivatives) chiroptical methods (VCD and ECD).







Abstract
Base induced activation of &#946;&#8208;naphthol toward the electrophilic aromatic substitution has been used for the synthesis of the unprecedented 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diselanediylbis(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol) fully characterized by means of NMR and X&#8208;Ray analysis. Its reactivity was studied and the synthesis of novel chiral selenium containing heterocycles was discovered. Chiroptical methods (VCD and ECD) were successfully used to define their absolute configuration and these results represent the first example reported for organoselenium derivatives.

         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of less reactive aryl chlorides by employing calcium carbide as an alkyne source was reported. Various of diarylethynes were obtained in approving yield by addition of ZnCl2, including the desired 1,2&#8208;bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene, even when being highly sterically hindered







Abstract
The direct synthesis of diarylethynes from less&#8208;reactive aryl chlorides and calcium carbide was accomplished by palladium catalysis. The coupling reaction is provided with broad substrate scope, the use of ZnCl2 as cocatalyst, and the use of safe, inexpensive and easy to handle acetylene source, and provided the desired 1,2&#8208;Bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene, even when being highly sterically hindered.

         <title>Structurally Forced Ion Binding Affinity: Tetraurea&#8208;Based Macrocycle as a Receptor for Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea&#8208;based receptors are commonly used as potent supramolecular tools for anion recognition. Here we report on a cyclization&#8208;driven change of complexation preferences of a urea&#8208;based receptor. This unique design gives the receptor selectivity for heavier alkali metal cations, rubidium and cesium. For suitable ion pairs the obtained macrocycle functions as a ditopic receptor, causing the formation of infinite hydrogen&#8208;bound chains.







Abstract
A urea&#8208;based complexation site represents a building block customarily used in the design of receptors for anion recognition. Here we report a cyclization driven change of complexation preferences, leading to a urea&#8208;based macrocyclic receptor with selectivity for heavier alkali metal cations. Moreover, thorough 1H and 19F NMR, HRMS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed an inherent capability of the macrocycle to interact with selected ion pairs.

         <title>Front Cover: Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Fluorescent Probes (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 23/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 23, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the action of a cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent probe inside a hypoxic A549 cell. Nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of hypoxia, transforms a carboxylic ester group on the central heptamethine chain through a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism into a brightly fluorescent carboxylate group, resulting in a &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescent response. The cell elements were provided by Reactome.org under the CC BY 4.0 license. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. &#352;tacko, B.&#8197;D. Smith et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>Recently, novel C5&#8208;position unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids in experiment. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8208;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8208;47.95 &#181;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaching Room&#8208;Temperature Mesomorphism through Expansion of the Tristriazolotriazine Core with Alkoxybenzoate Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tristriazolotriazine (TTT)  N  &#8208;heterocycle, despite being a relatively new mesogenic core for use in discotic liquid crystals, has already demonstrated its importance and promising characteristics. In this work, we extended the knowledge about the TTT, increasing the core size with alkoxybenzoate units, as well as evaluating how the expansion and number of peripheral chains affected the thermal and photophysical properties, both in solution and spin&#8208;coated films. Their thermal behaviour and self&#8208;assembly were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, while the photophysics was investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that despite a considerable decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield with the core expansion, the mesomorphic properties are significantly enhanced, with two products showing Col  h  mesophase at room temperature, with large range of mesomorphism and very good thermal stability. It was also demonstrated how structural changes affected the self&#8208;assembly properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Iodine Mediated Oxidation of Arylated &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Sulfoxonium Ylides to 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoxonium ylides in recent years have proved to be versatile building blocks and have found applications towards the synthesis of structurally diverse organic molecules. In this research article, we delineate a new oxidative, molecular iodine&#8208;mediated transformation on sterically encumbered arylated sulfoxonium ylides, that give access to 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl containing compounds. Twenty&#8208;six examples have been realized (49&#8208;92% yields), with structural diversity modified at two key sites on the sulfoxonium ylide reactants. Furthermore, the protocol benefits from the use of inexpensive molecular iodine to mediate the oxidation and, from a sustainability viewpoint, short reaction times (30 minutes), ambient temperature, and ethyl acetate as a greener reaction solvent. Experimental studies also gave insight to the mechanism of the reaction, involving DMSO as an oxygen source.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sulfoxonium ylides in recent years have proved to be versatile building blocks and have found applications towards the synthesis of structurally diverse organic molecules. In this research article, we delineate a new oxidative, molecular iodine-mediated transformation on sterically encumbered arylated sulfoxonium ylides, that give access to 1,2-dicarbonyl containing compounds. Twenty-six examples have been realized (49-92% yields), with structural diversity modified at two key sites on the sulfoxonium ylide reactants. Furthermore, the protocol benefits from the use of inexpensive molecular iodine to mediate the oxidation and, from a sustainability viewpoint, short reaction times (30 minutes), ambient temperature, and ethyl acetate as a greener reaction solvent. Experimental studies also gave insight to the mechanism of the reaction, involving DMSO as an oxygen source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in a very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner by using a combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208; p &#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes under the catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperature for few hours. This is one of the unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Greener Synthesis of Pyrroloquinazoline Derivatives: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucose in Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective modification of carbohydrate residues in glycopeptides is highly relevant as a tool in glycobiology. Oxidation in particular allows subsequent ligation with a label or handle and can be effectuated enzymatically or chemically. Chemical oxidation of carbohydrate residues in glycopeptides is nearly invariably done using periodate cleavage, leading to aldehydes. In this work we apply palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation for the same purpose. The catalyst, [(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2, developed for the site&#8208;selective oxidation of mono&#8208; and oligosaccharides on preparative scale, proved suitable for the oxidation of glucose residues in a series of glucopeptides. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions is necessary to get acceptable conversions without excessive over&#8208;oxidation of amino acid side&#8208;chains, in particular threonine. The resulting carbonyl function can be used for an oxime&#8208;ligation to biotin. A protocol for the analysis of the products using mass spectrometry is presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Sea Discovery and Detective Work: Towards Solving the Hemicalide Structural Enigma through Computational NMR Analysis and Stereocontrolled Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights how the judicious and synergistic application of computational NMR analysis and stereocontrolled synthesis has enabled the incremental assignment of hemicalide&#8208;a complex and extraordinarily bioactive marine polyketide containing 21 unknown stereocentres.







Abstract
The marine natural product hemicalide displays potent anticancer activity. While detailed NMR experiments established the planar carbon skeleton, its full configurational assignment proved enigmatic. This Review summarises ongoing synthetic efforts and NMR studies on hemicalide, which have succeeded in reducing the number of possible stereoisomers from more than one million to a more manageable eight structures, setting the stage for a focused total synthesis campaign.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

         <title>Parallel Screening with 14C&#8208;Labeled Carbon Dioxide: De&#8208;risking the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA drugs.







Abstract
Carbon isotope labeling is a useful technology for tracking the fate of organic compounds in the environment and in living organisms. In this context, the development of robust and general methodologies amenable to the direct functionalization of CO2 remains a significant task. In this communication, a de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence for carbon isotope labeling. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA approved drugs.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Isosorbide Imidates by Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regiodivergent synthesis of exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates containing biologically relevant N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzothiazole, benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole) has been achieved by oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis starting from aldimine starting materials. A large library of unprecedented high value&#8208;added products has been obtained with good levels of yield and regioselectivity.







Abstract
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;promoted regiodivergent protocol for exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates synthesis is described. The disclosed strategy allows the straightforward synthesis of monoimidate&#8208;isosorbides (MIIs) endowed with the biologically relevant benzothiazole (BTA) moiety under mild oxidative conditions, starting from easy&#8208;accessible aldimines. Process optimization encompassed the use of stoichiometric diquinone as well as atmospheric oxygen as oxidant species, focusing on reaction dichotomy between oxidative and oxygenative pathways. The reaction scope was investigated on a representative selection of BTA&#8208;containing aldimines and further extended to congeners bearing different biologically pivotal N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole), observing good levels of yield (up to 87&#8201;%) and regioselectivity (exo/endo up to 10.0; endo/exo up to 7.0). Furthermore, the employment of an immobilized&#8208;NHC under heterogeneous conditions was assessed, showing satisfactory selectivity towards exo&#8208;MIIs (exo/endo=3.8). Overall, the methodology presented provided an unprecedented collection of high value&#8208;added products with potential applications in different fields.

A selective deconstructive strategy of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizines to hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed and applied to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of cuscutamine. Additionally, controversy of the absolute configuration of the natural products was clarified.







Abstract
The general approach for accessing to a tetracyclic hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;indolizino[8,7&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;one alkaloids is that what involves the construction of the &#947;&#8208;lactam ring from a tricyclic precursor. Here in this report, we disclose a new synthetic strategy that permits the direct deconstruction of the tetracyclic indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizine motif into the tetracyclic hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one scaffold of the naturally occurring (+)&#8208;cuscutamine without the use of either transition or precious metals. Additionally, the current total synthesis of both enantiomers provides structural clarification of the natural occurring alkaloid.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Way Regioselective Synthesis of Amino&#8208;Acid Decorated Imidazole, Purine and Pyrimidine Derivatives by Multicomponent Chemistry Starting from Prebiotic Diaminomaleonitrile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid decorated imidazole, pyrimidine and purine derivatives, resembling analogues of peptide nucleic acid&#8217;s building blocks, have been synthesized by a three&#8208;way multicomponent chemistry of diaminomaleonitrile, one of the most studied chemical precursors in prebiotic chemistry. The regioselectivity of the multicomponent reaction between diaminomaleonitrile, trimethyl orthoacetate and a selected panel of a&#8208;amino acids, was controlled by the energy source used for triggering the condensation. Imidazole derivatives were obtained under thermal condition, while photochemical and combined photothermal conditions afforded pyrimidine and purine derivatives, respectively. The three synthetic pathways were independent of each other, the type of product being controlled by the chemical intermediates prevailing in the reaction mixture. In addition to the synthetic potential of these multicomponent reactions in the preparation of a large variety of heterocycles, the control of the synthesis of peptide nucleic acid&#8217;s building blocks, simply by changing the nature of the energy source, further enlarged the chemical complexity available in prebiotic conditions for the emergence of pristine pre&#8208;genetic codes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral isoxazole and carbocyclic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues were synthesized via (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of chiral pyrimidinyl&#8208;substituted dimethyl cyclopropanedicarboxylates. In the presence of MgI  2  , (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of chiral pyrimidinyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes with nitrosoarenes afforded diverse chiral isoxazole pyrimidine nucleoside analogues in up to 78% yield and 88&#8208;96% ee. Using Nd(OTf)  3  as the catalyst, the annulation reaction with silyl enol ethers generated a series of chiral carbocyclic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues in up to 64% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, and 87&#8208;96% ee. The proposed methods either reduced or avoided partial racemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Molecular Shape on the Properties of Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole&#8208;Based Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>A concave indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole&#8208;based compound was synthesized and characterized, which was further compared with the property of its planar congener. The results reveal that the change in molecular shape alters the molecular electronic structure, thus leading to the reduced aromaticity and divergent energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals of the concave compound. Moreover, the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule demonstrates a blue&#8208;shift in the UV/vis absorption and a red&#8208;shift in the weakened fluorescence emission due to the vibration of the concave face.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic investigation to achieve a novel intermediate of tamiflu by using  cis  &#8208;aziridine as a chiral building block which is readily synthesized from &#7429;&#8208;mannitol as a renewable starting material has been presented. The present approach utilizes the intramolecular Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction as the key step for the synthesis of tamiflu. On the other hand, diene containing allylic aziridine framework is found to be inefficient to furnish the six&#8208;membered core skeleton of tamiflu through ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards the Synthesis of Highly Hindered Pyrrolidines by Intramolecular AAC Click Reactions: What Can Be Learned from DFT Calculations?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthesis of a highly substituted biomass&#8208;derived chiral pyrrolidine conveniently functionalized to obtain macrocycles through intramolecular &#8220;click&#8221; reactions is reported. The experimental difficulties encountered during the macrocyclization stage led us to conduct an extensive DFT study to understand the origins of the findings. The results obtained suggest that the improper conformational landscape of the reactant precludes the pre&#8208;organization required to connect the reactive moieties. We propose that the cumulative Boltzmann amplitudes of reactive conformations (CBAR) prove to be a simple and useful parameter to predict the success or failure of related transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#945;,6&#946;&#8208;Dihydroxyandrostan&#8208;17&#8208;one 3&#8208;Glucuronides for the Detection of Testosterone Misuse</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The convenient synthesis of two 3&#8208;glucuronide conjugates of 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyandrosterone (6OH&#8208;And&#8208;3G  2  ) and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyetiocholanolone (6OH&#8208;Etio&#8208;3G  3  ) is reported. The conjugates are identified as long&#8208;term markers of endogenous androgenic anabolic steroid abuse in doping control studies. Their resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis by  E. coli  &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase means they may be missed by conventional GC&#8208;MS analysis protocols. One promising strategy to quantify these markers is by direct methods, which requires sufficient quantities of high purity reference materials. Our convergent synthesis features concurrent stereoselective introduction of 5&#945;/5&#946; hydrogen and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxy groups on the steroid skeleton, and a mild Schmidt trichloroacetimidate glycosylation strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient method for vinyl or aryl C(sp 2 )&#8208;O bond forming to construct both the ( Z )&#8208;2&#8208;iodovinyl aryl ethers and diaryl ethers under metal&#8208;, photocatalyst&#8208; and light&#8208;free condition in one&#8208;step, has been developed. To generate the two desired products, we proposed a S NAr 2 reaction of phenol with vinyl aryl iodonium salts intermediates that subsequently lead to the phenyl&#8208;I bond cleavage and phenyl&#8208;O bond formation. We firstly found that the vinyl aryl iodonium salts was formed in situ from the spiro&#8208; cis &#8208; &#946; &#8208;phenol&#8208;VBXs, which was generated between electrophilic spiro&#8208;EBXs and nucleophilic arylols. Tri&#8208;substituted alkenes and functionalized diaryl ethers can be afforded from the two desired products.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manuscript deals with the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy with rational protecting group manipulations. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA and the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc residues. The introduction of the desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved via late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary&#8208;OH group on the protected trisaccharide. 1,2&#8208;cis aminoethyl glycoside with central glucosamine is used at the reducing end to the leave the scope for further glycoconjugate formation with suitable aglycone without hampering the anomeric stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Reductive Alkylation of Indoles: Late&#8208;Stage Diversification for Bioactive Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles was well established, which exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, this environmental&#8208;friendly methodology also finds application in the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH for the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmental&#8208;friendly process exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8722;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive computational study of the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism is reported. Up to 32 &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical/organic halide combinations are explored to understand the effect of the C&#8722;X bond, the influence of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical properties and the alkyl or aryl character of the reactive C center in the reactivity.







Abstract
Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8211;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents, although the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 32&#8197;reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8722;X and Cy&#8722;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Hammett Correlation in Competing Fragmentations of Ionized 2&#8208;Substituted Benzanilides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A good Hammett correlation has been found between the two principal fragmentations of four series of ionized 2&#8208;substituted benzanilides of general structure XC 6 H 4 NHCOC 6 H 4 Y [X = CH 3 O, Cl, Br or I; Y = H, F, Cl, Br, I, CH 3 , CH 3 O, CF 3 or NO 2 in the 3 or 4 position]. When X is electron&#8208;donating, with a negative substituent constant, &#963;, simple cleavage to form a substituted benzoyl cation, [YC 6 H 4 CO] + , is favoured. In contrast, when Y is electron withdrawing, with a positive &#963; constant, rearrangement leading to elimination of X . by a proximity effect to form a protonated 2&#8208;arylbenzoxazole competes more effectively. A good correlation (R 2 value in the range 0.84&#8208;0.92) is obtained if &#963; constants are used to create the Hammett plot. However, an even better correlation (R 2 value in the range 0.90&#8208;0.96) is obtained if &#963; + or &#963; &#8208; constants are substituted for &#963; constants for two substituents (OCH 3 and NO 2 , respectively, in the 4 position that have a powerful +M and &#8208;M mesomeric effect). Reproducible trends are observed in the reaction constant, &#961;, which declines on progressing from X = CH 3 O through Cl, and Br to I, in the range 0.69 to 0.46 (with only &#963; constants) or 0.56 to 0.38 (with &#963; + or &#963; &#8208; constants substituted for &#963; constants for OCH 3 and NO 2 , respectively, in the 4&#8208;position). These trends establish that the mechanism of the proximity effect involves donation of electron density from the C 6 H 4 Y ring and is not materially altered by varying X.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Photocatalyzed Halogen&#8208;Radical Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis is a method of choice for the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Review collects the recent examples exploiting this manifold to generate highly aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. Available strategies to influence site&#8208;selectivity of the hydrogen atom transfer step have also been discussed.







Abstract
The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.

         <title>Robust Synthesis of Tetra&#8208;Boronate Esters Analogues and the Corresponding Boronic Acids Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and robust synthetic strategy that could build a series of tetra&#8208;boronate analogues in gram&#8208;scale is reported. Further, a universal deprotection condition that allows the direct transformation of tetra&#8208;boronates to their corresponding boronic acids is also included in this study.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications, because of their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkene Formation from Reductive Aldehyde Homo&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the PIII of a phosphanyl phosphonate reagent MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2 (see Figure) renders the reductive aldehyde coupling of aldehydes selectively for the thermodynamically less stable Z&#8208;olefin product.







Abstract
Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E&#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z&#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2, 6, with an electron&#8208;deficient MesF=2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z&#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient MesF, which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of MesF, the E&#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P&#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of the Z&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Aerobic Baeyer&#8722;Villiger oxidation catalyzed by metal corroles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal corrole catalyzed Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction was successfully achieved for the first time. Among all tested Co, Mn, Fe and Cu complexes of 5, 10, 15&#8208;Tris (pentafluorophenyl) corrole, Fe complex [Fe(tpfc)Cl] exhibited the best activity and the highest yield was observed for six membered cyclic ketones. Preliminary results suggest that Fe(tpfc)Cl may act as an initiator for dehydrogenation of benzaldehyde to generate benzoyl radical, which will form peroxybenzoic acid under molecular oxygen atmosphere. The oxidation of Fe(tpfc)Cl catalyst by peroxybenzoic acid produces high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo corrole intermediate. The iron&#8208;oxo corrole is attacked by cyclohexanone to form a Criegee adduct, which will finally generate &#949;&#8208;caprolactone product to finish the catalytic cycle. The 4A&#8208;MS additive may accelerate the production of perbenzoic acid and significantly improve the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical reagents used to achieve a predictable and programmable time&#8208;control of the pH of water solutions are reviewed with the purpose to present a toolbox of instruments to be used when a precise pH vs time profile is needed  . Such tools are particularly useful in view of the growing interest on dissipative systems, many of which operate in water solution, under the action of reagents (chemical fuels) that allow programmed pH evolution. After a brief introduction describing the importance of such tools for the operation of dissipative systems in water, five sections follow, which describe the different method used so far to temporally control the pH of a water solutions. In particular time&#8208;programmable pH variations based on: i) bubbling of gases (CO  2  , N  2  , Air), ii) hydrolysis of esters, lactones and sultones, iii) enzymatic and biocatalytic networks, iv) decarboxylation reaction of activated carboxylic acids, and v) pH&#8208;oscillators, will be described together with selected examples of application.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Photoswitching for Rate Enhancement of a Organocatalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organocatalysis, many transformations require quite high catalyst loadings, as the processes are sluggish and complex equilibria are involved. Here, in&#8197;situ light irradiation with a specific wavelength inside NMR is applied to increase reaction rates of hydrazone cyclization. This enhancement was achieved by isomerizing the substrate to the reactive configuration.







Abstract
In this article, we report that applying in&#8197;situ LED&#8208;NMR irradiation with appropriate wavelength resulted in the photoswitching of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazone C=N double bond configuration. This reaction was previously reported to be the first step in a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction, where the minor but stable Z&#8208;isomer is the reactive intermediate. By enhancing the rate of the isomerization, we could show that the overall rate of the cyclization could be increased and followed directly by NMR kinetics. Exclusively light with a specific wavelength matching the isomerization process affected the cyclization. The light&#8208; and acid&#8208;mediated isomerization provide complementary pathways that can be exploited in synthetic applications to increase reaction rates of asymmetric transformations, especially in reactions requiring high loadings of elaborate chiral catalysts.

     alt="Substrate Photoswitching for Rate Enhancement of a Organocatalytic Cyclization Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organocatalysis, many transformations require quite high catalyst loadings, as the processes are sluggish and complex equilibria are involved. Here, &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; light irradiation with a specific wavelength inside NMR is applied to increase reaction rates of hydrazone cyclization. This enhancement was achieved by isomerizing the substrate to the reactive configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we report that applying &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; LED-NMR irradiation with appropriate wavelength resulted in the photoswitching of an &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated hydrazone C=N double bond configuration. This reaction was previously reported to be the first step in a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid-catalyzed cyclization reaction, where the minor but stable &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer is the reactive intermediate. By enhancing the rate of the isomerization, we could show that the overall rate of the cyclization could be increased and followed directly by NMR kinetics. Exclusively light with a specific wavelength matching the isomerization process affected the cyclization. The light- and acid-mediated isomerization provide complementary pathways that can be exploited in synthetic applications to increase reaction rates of asymmetric transformations, especially in reactions requiring high loadings of elaborate chiral catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

         <title>Zirconium Promoted Synthetic Transformations of Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds have extreme potential for organic synthesis. Ready functionalization of organoboron intrigued people to develop various protocols for their synthesis. Over the last several decades, there has been a substantial development in synthesizing new organoboron compounds using transition metals. Among various transition metals, zirconium has also been found to catalyze diverse reactions of organoboron. The zirconium chemistry has become more popular with the development of zirconium metallocenes, particularly bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene chloride hydride, the well&#8208;known Schwartz reagent. These zirconium metallocenes possess a significant role in hydrozirconation, hydroboration, hydrogenation, carbozirconation, and a promising tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyl tin hydride alternative. This minireview focuses on the various transformations of organoboron employing zirconium catalysts that have been developed so far.</dc:description>

The high diastereoselectivity in the nucleophilic addition of trivalent phosphorus to chiral cyclic imines is in agreement with precedent reports.

         <dc:description>In the present study, the synthesis of an influential group of organic compounds that are broadly used in pharmaceutical and industrial compounds under completely safe and benign conditions was investigated. Dual nickel/carbon nitride (Ni/g&#8208;C3N4) photocatalyst was able to photosynthesize a wide range of amide derivatives under mild, environmentally friendly, one&#8208;pot conditions by cross&#8208;coupling reaction of benzamides with aryl halides. Also, oxidative amidation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with primary and secondary amines has been investigated. The synthesis of various derivatives of esters was performed based on the cross&#8208;coupling reaction between carboxylic acids with aryl halides. Surprisingly, decarboxylation of carboxylic acid derivatives occurred with changing ambient conditions, and biaryl derivatives, the importance of which is known to all, were synthesized. A vast range of aromatic and aliphatic starting materials according to protocols of green chemistry in solvent&#8208;free or benignant solvent conditions at ambient temperature without the presence of ligands or additives through the medium of cost&#8208;effective, heterogeneous, and recyclable photocatalyst that is activated by a renewable light source were used.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last few decades, primary and secondary amines have been enormously used to trigger numerous valuable transformations. Likewise, modern&#8208;day chemistry has witnessed the potentiality of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis via single photoelectron transfer reactions.

This catalytic system showcases a new green and sustainable synthetic approach which is advantageous from other methods. The emerging area of research demonstrates high efficiency of this dual&#8208;catalytic system to access the plethora of molecular complexity enantioselectively. Present minireview comprises several momentous developments that surfaced in the last five years in the field of photoredox&#8208;amine dual catalysis underpinning all types of synthetic transformations.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape-selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme-like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic kinetic resolution to access enantiomerically enriched dihydropyrimidinone/thiones via recognition of a remote stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from  Candida antarctica  . Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8208;5 bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient construction of quaternary carbon center is a formidable challenging task due to their enhanced structural complexity. Although the catalytic  gem&#8208;  difunctionalization of  &#945;  &#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds via metal&#8208;carbenoids is a well&#8208;documented, developing new methods to access quaternary carbon centers which are difficult or unattainable in monocatalysis is highly desirable. Dual catalysis where two different catalysts work concurrently has emerged as a powerful strategy to achieve new reactivity and selectivity. In this minireview, we highlight the recent advances in cooperative Rh(II)/Pd(0) dual catalysis for the constructions of quaternary carbon centers, focusing on the synthetic utility of stable  &#945;  &#8208;diazo&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto&#8208;esters and allylic carboxylates. Additionally, several challenging asymmetric Rh(II)/Pd(0) dual&#8208;catalyzed transformations generating chiral quaternary carbon centers are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates, inspired by nature, the photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction which has a high potential for a successful transition towards renewable energy sources and decreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. In artificial systems, new photosensitizers and catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals should combine high efficiency and low environmental footprint. Photoinduced e&#8208; transfer processes reduce CO2 into valuable chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methane. More information can be found in the Review by C. Bizzarri.

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent antagonists able to reach the four carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of DC&#8208;SIGN have been prepared. The extended rigid core of these glycodendrimers allows multivalent presentation of glycomimetic molecules in a spatially defined fashion, providing high affinity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and selectivity over other C&#8208;type lectins featuring distinct CRD arrangements. The constructs successfully inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and DC&#8208;SIGN mediated trans&#8208;infection by Ebola virus.







Abstract
Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. In this work, we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus trans&#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.

         <title>A Mechanistic Approach to Liquid&#8208;Assisted Mechanochemical Synthesis of 5&#8208;Aryl/Spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones</title>

Room temperature, Liquid assisted grinding was used for the synthesis 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and atom economic process bearing wide substrate scope and the isolation of products is chromatography free. It shows an efficient application of mechanochemical synthesis and also exemplifies green chemistry.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <title>BF3 mediated [1,5]&#8208;Hydride Shift Triggered Cyclization: Thioethers Join the Game</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;(2&#8208;(Benzylthio)benzylidene)malonates can undergo the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift triggered cyclization resulting in thiachromanes in 45&#8208;84% yield. Boron trifluoride as a reaction promotor is the key of success. DFT&#8208;calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via a chelate BF2 complex, that was confirmed by NMR&#8208;analysis. Experimental and theoretical comparison of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon analogues, revealed that sulfur derivatives have the highest activation barrier for the hydride transfer due to the unfavourable transition state geometry, which explains the lack of previous reports on 1,5&#8208;hydride shifts in (alkylthio)styrenes.</dc:description>

Abstract
A convenient and versatile synthesis of &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, including &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones and &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones by using Wu&#8211;Colby's protocol involving the release of trifluoroacetate was reported. The ketones&#8217; application as monofluoroalkyl building blocks was explored through coupling and radical reactions. The results indicated that &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones are the most popular reagents to construct diverse valuable single&#8208;fluorinated molecules.

         <title>Humins&#8208;Like Solid Support for Palladium Immobilization: Highly Efficient and Recyclable Catalyst for Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present work, a new humins&#8208;like resin was prepared using 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) and maleic anhydride in 2 min at 110 &#176;C. Such a new material was used as a solid support for palladium immobilization. For metal anchoring, encapsulation was the method of choice and palladium was encapsulated by in&#8208;situ polymerization. This resulting Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was characterized by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, FT&#8208;IR, SEM, TGA, DSC, XRD, and XPS. To demonstrate proof of concept, Heck and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to evaluate the activity and reusability of the catalyst. Green solvents such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), CyreneTM and ethylene carbonate proved to be excellent reaction media for Heck coupling, whereas EtOH/H2O was preferred for Suzuki coupling. Yields of up to 99% were obtained in both cases. The recyclability of the Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was also demonstrated, 7 cycles have been achieved without loss of catalytic activity in both Heck and Suzuki reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Cycloaddition of an Isolable Dialkylsilylene with Diaryl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloaddition of silylenes with diaryl ketones is an attractive chemical transformation to 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (o&#8208;isotoluene) derivatives. We found that the dearomative (1+4) cycloadditions of an isolable dialkylsilylene (  1  ) proceed faster with electron&#8208;rich diaryl ketones and preferentially occurs at an electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diaryl ketones. Theoretical calculations indicated a carbonyl silaylide (a silylene&#8208;ketone complex) is a key intermediate, which is mainly stabilized by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions of a lone pair orbital on oxygen atom&#160;of the diaryl ketones and a vacant 3p orbital of&#160;  1  . The carbonyl silaylide undergoes the Si&#8208;C bond formation at the ortho&#8208;position of one aryl ring to form formal (1+4) cycloadduct with a very small activation barrier. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the (1+4) cycloadducts reveals their&#160;o&#8208;isotoluene structures. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of the (1+4) cycloadducts in hexane exhibit a &#960;&#8208;&#960;* (HOMO&#8208;LUMO) transition around 370 nm.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>C(sp  2  )&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling is one of the powerful transformations in organic synthesis to construct highly ubiquitous anilines and aniline derivatives. The dominance of Pd&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based catalytic systems is evident in the field for a long time. However, Ni&#8208;catalysed methodologies for achieving this reaction have grown gradually as sustainable alternatives in the last two decades.

         <title>Versatility of the Amino Group in Hydrazone&#8208;based Molecular and Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazones are common building blocks of supramolecular entities because they can undergo conformational, configurational, and/or constitutional changes in response to an external stimulus. This Review explores the important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in these different dynamics in molecular and supramolecular systems published in the last decades. Some synthetic methodologies to obtain them are also described.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;based systems have been, and continue to be, widely studied in the field of supramolecular chemistry due to the chemical versatility of their triatomic C=N&#8208;N structure, whose amino nitrogen commonly bears a methyl group or a hydrogen atom. Herein we review the conformational, configurational, and constitutional dynamics of these systems, focusing on the particularly important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in each of those processes observed in molecular and supramolecular systems published in recent decades. Due to the enormous diversity of supramolecular architectures and molecular entities, the most representative synthetic methodologies to obtain them are described.

         <title>Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin&#8208;like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L&#8208;fucose, D&#8208;galactose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe7 and Arg8), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser3, Pro4, and Val13).







Abstract
Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA&#8208;conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17 were crucial for binding BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose, BSA&#8208;D&#8208;galactose and BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser3, Pro4, and Val13 resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg8 plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose/D&#8208;galactose from BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. The thermodynamics of binding of the selected alanine analogues was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Low to moderate binding affinities were determined for the tetravalent MUC1 glycopeptide and asialofetuin, respectively, and high for the fucose rich polysaccharide, fucoidan. The thermodynamic profile of interactions with asialofetuin exhibits shift to an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism compared to the fucoidan, which displayed an enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation, typically associated with the carbohydrate&#8208;lectin recognition process.

&lt;p&gt;The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin-like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L-fucose, D-galactose and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Lys&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Tyr&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, Leu&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, and Thr&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and Arg&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pro&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and Val&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA-conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>A Photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama Reaction Catalytic in Chromium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylation of aldehydes is possible by a real photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.







Abstract
Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <dc:description>
A small library of sydnone&#8208;modified mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycan structures were synthesized chemoenzymatically, allowing for the facile preparation of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;array, by means of metal&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC), for studying O&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation has been shown to be essential for many biological processes. However, determining the exact relationship between O&#8208;glycan structures and their biological activity remains challenging. Here we report that, unlike azides, sydnones can be incorporated as an aglycon into core 1 O&#8208;glycans early&#8208;on in their synthesis since it is compatible with carbohydrate chemistry and enzymatic glycosylations, allowing us to generate a small library of sydnone&#8208;containing core 1 O&#8208;glycans by chemoenzymatic synthesis. The sydnone&#8208;aglycon was then employed for the facile preparation of an O&#8208;glycan array, via bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction, and in turn was utilized for the high&#8208;throughput screening of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;lectin interactions. This sydnone&#8208;aglycon, particularly adapted for O&#8208;glycomics, is a valuable chemical tool that complements the limited technologies available for investigating O&#8208;glycan structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Homogeneous Systems Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes for Photoactivated CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, homogeneous earth&#8208;abundant systems that can photoactivate CO2 reduction by means of visible light are reported. In particular, advances on this topic of the past five years (2017&#8211;2021) are reviewed.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 into advantageous chemicals is a noteworthy pathway to close the carbon cycle and decrease carbon footprint. The use of visible light and ultimately solar radiation is extremely interesting in managing energy issues. Similarly, the employment of cost&#8208;effective materials guides to environmentally friendly applications. This Review addresses the homogeneous systems used for photoactivated the CO2 reduction in the last years, highlighting the earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based components. Besides those systems composed only of noble metal&#8208;free units, hybrid systems, also containing a noble metal&#8208;based complex, are also examined, revealing that research needs to increase the attention on more sustainable alternatives.

         <title>Light as a Tool in Organic Photocatalysis: Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation and Chromoselective Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes recent advancements in photocatalysis related to the applications of light as a tool for controlling the reactions selectivity and reactivity. The concepts and applications of multi&#8208;photon excitation photoredox catalysis and chromoselective catalysis in organic synthesis are discussed.







Abstract
Over the past decades, photoredox catalysis has developed to the big mature field of chemistry. Especially in the field of organic synthesis, more and more sustainable alternatives to conventional synthesis are being developed. Nonetheless, most research activities are focused on the development of new synthetic pathways, utilizing photons as a source of energy for breaking and building of new chemical bonds. We discuss here cases, where selection of the irradiation mode, light intensity (one&#8208;, two&#8208; photons) or wavelength (UV, blue, green) has a crucial role on the outcome of the photocatalytic event. Thus, control over irradiation conditions influence the reaction mechanism and offers an access to highly reactive species that are otherwise hardly available. This allows for the unique chemical events to happen, such as deep reduction reactions. The principles of these concepts and their applications are reviewed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

         <title>Radical Deoxyfunctionalisation Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their abundance and readily available synthesis, alcohols provide ideal handles for the selective derivatisation of organic molecules. Radical chemistry offers versatile strategies for the conversion of C  sp  3  &#8211;O bonds into a wide range of C  sp  3  &#8211;C, C  sp  3  &#8211;H, or &#160;C  sp  3  &#8211;heteroatom bonds. In these reactions, alcohols are readily derivatised with an activator group which can undergo facile mesolysis to generate a primary, secondary, or tertiary open&#8208;shell species that can engage in further transformations. These strategies are particularly effective at overcoming steric limitations associated with nucleophilic substitution pathways. Despite their potential, the use of radical deoxyfunctionalisation reactions as a general strategy for the synthesis of useful and complex molecules remains underutilised. Herein, we highlight recent advancements in this exciting field using photocatalysis, transition metal catalysis or electrochemistry to initiate the radical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <title>Chemical Biology of &#945;GalCer: A Chemist's Toolbox for the Stimulation of Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to the chemist's toolbox for the stimulation of invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells. This Review encompasses the synthetic strategies for the preparation of the iNKT cell agonist &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer), its TH1/TH2 skewing analogs, and other synthetic probes for the elucidation of mechanisms of &#945;GalCer trafficking.







Abstract
Often referred to as the &#8220;Swiss Army knife&#8221; of the immune system, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes stimulated by the synthetic glycolipid &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) when in complex with the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells. Through their ability to produce TH1 and TH2 cytokines and co&#8208;stimulate several other lymphocytes, iNKT cells have emerged as central players in directing the immune response in a range of physiological processes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Over the years, synthetic chemistry has advanced the field of iNKT cell stimulation with the development of more efficient approaches to prepare &#945;GalCer, and, additionally, with the chemical synthesis of &#945;GalCer analogs in the search of better TH1/TH2 cytokine skewing compounds for therapeutic applications. Here, we review the strategies for the synthesis of &#945;GalCer and its analogs, including synthetic probes, together with the most important advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds, as a guide to the available tools for interrogating the iNKT cell&#8722;&#945;GalCer&#8722;CD1d complex and inspiration for future research.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8211;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quinazoline&#8208;Assisted ortho&#8208;Halogenation with N&#8208;Halosuccinimides through Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

     alt="Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S-aryl S-perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized S-aryl S-perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S-trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized S-aryl S-perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation and Etherification Reactions of Benzylic Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistriflimide&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of benzylacetates with both trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes lead to propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The acid assists the release of the reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the media, which is the ultimate catalytic species. The cationic nature of the processes is documented.







Abstract
Addition of catalytic amounts of bistriflimide triggers useful coupling reactions of benzyl acetates with trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes to afford propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The added acid assists the release of reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the reaction media, which were found to act as the ultimate catalytic species responsible for the C&#8722;C and the C&#8722;O forming steps. The cationic nature of these coupling processes is documented.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

         <title>The Structure of Hemicalide from the Marine Sponge Hemimycale sp</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemicalide, isolated from the marine sponge Hemimycale sp., is a very potent cytotoxic compound from a marine sponge with an original mode of action. Its planar structure has been established by NMR and a proposal for 17 of its 21 stereogenic centers is made on the basis of syntheses of analogues.







Abstract
Hemicalide is a marine natural product isolated from the sponge Hemimycale sp., collected near the Torres Islands of Vanuatu. It is characterized by cytotoxicity in the sub&#8208;nanomolar range, with an original mode of action. This article describes the establishment of the planar structure of hemicalide, based on extensive use of 2D&#8208;NMR experiments. The molecule belongs to the polyketide class with an irregular combination of acetates and propionates and adorned with two unusual hydroxylated six&#8208;membered ring lactones. After publication of the original patent, groups in Paris and Cambridge (UK) launched synthetic programmes with the aim of elucidating the configurations of some of the 21 stereogenic centers. The second part of the article discusses these achievements and presents the best hypothesis, to date, for hemicalide.

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly, substrate compatibility was explored. 21 new disulfide and thioether macrocycles were synthesized that incorporated a wide breadth of structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene Carbonates from Aromatic Aldehydes
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one&#8208;pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The combination of a N&#8208;phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent-free conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one-pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent-free conditions. The combination of a &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity. The reaction scope was investigated with a range of aromatic aldehydes and the corresponding vinylene carbonates were obtained with 32&#8211;86&#8201;% isolated yields (14&#8197;examples).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

         <dc:description>
A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis Enables the Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Olefins Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins with carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed, which is based on visible&#8208;light photoredox/boronic acid catalysis. The direct use of CAs as acyl&#8208;radical precursors was made possible with the aid of boronic acid, and CAs were easily converted into the corresponding cyclic ketones without the need for any stoichiometric activating reagents.







Abstract
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins using carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed. With the aid of a boronic acid, CAs can be used as acyl&#8208;radical precursors in catalytic photoredox reactions driven by visible light. The CAs are easily converted into their corresponding cyclic ketones without the need to use any stoichiometric activating reagents. Mechanistic studies implied that the formation of an &#8220;ate&#8221; complex from the CA and boronic acid is crucial for the generation of the acyl radical equivalent from the unreactive carboxy group.

         <title>Origins of Organic Chemistry and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of organic chemistry and organic synthesis started in the middle ages, long before molecular compositions were known. Paradigm shifts caused by Lavoisier, Chevreuil, W&#246;hler, Liebig, Kolbe and Berthelot are highlighted. The graphic shows some early key organic molecules, but although synthesis and analysis had become well established sciences by the 1840s, the chemical structures remained essentially unknown.







Abstract
The words organic and synthesis originate with Aristotle (meaning &#8216;instrumental&#8217; and &#8216;put together&#8217;, respectively) but had different meanings over time. The iatrochemists prepared numerous pharmaceutical remedies in the 1600s but had no concept of organic chemistry. Buffon, Bergman and Gren defined organic bodies as living things in the 1700s, but discrete organic compounds remained unknown. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, organic natural products were isolated by Scheele, and Chevreuil separated carboxylic acids from saponification of fats. Organic chemistry had started. Lavoisier invented and Berzelius improved combustion analysis for organic characterization. Descartes&#8217; dictum that synthesis is required to prove an analysis was enacted by Bergman and others. The concept of organic chemistry changed radically when W&#246;hler and Kolbe prepared organic compounds from the elements. Berthelot's syntheses of non&#8208;natural fats in 1853 started modern synthetic organic chemistry as the chemistry of carbon compounds, regardless of whether occurring in Nature or not.

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters and Amides through Hydrogen Borrowing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the iridium catalysed direct alkylation of amino esters and amides using alcohols, which can utilise both the free base and HCl salts of the amine, was developed. This reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen borrowing mechanism.







Abstract
The iridium catalysed N&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and amides using alcohols through hydrogen borrowing has been developed. The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.

A conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall was facilely synthesized. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by different techniques. Its photophysical properties and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices were further studied.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices.
