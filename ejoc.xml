         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Silanes with SF6 for Efficient Synthesis of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as distinctive oxidant and water as the oxygen source to transform silanes into siloxanes has been developed under mild conditions, realizing the efficient utilization and degradation of the strong greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, simultaneously. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, and it has been confirmed that the oxygen atoms in the resulting siloxanes indeed originate from water by isotopic labeling experiments with 18O.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation/Mumm Rearrangement towards Imides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize the corresponding imides. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective oxidation of aliphatic carboxylic acids appears to be the key step in this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

         <title>Base&#8208; and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Formation of 3&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one</title>

         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst&#8208;free visible&#8208;light protocol was developed to access a variety of 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Two initiation mechanisms proved to be effective for transformation.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium salts are versatile compounds known for their reactivity in various transformations. In this study, we explored the arylation of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinones using aryl diazonium salts. The objective was to develop a method for accessing 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, a class of compounds with diverse biological activities and synthetic importance. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the significance of light irradiation for improved yields. The substrate scope investigation demonstrated the compatibility of various diazonium salts and N&#8208;substituents on the 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone scaffold, yielding the corresponding methoxy lactams with high yields. Mechanistic insights were obtained by observing the effect of base and light irradiation. Two initiation mechanisms were proposed: in the presence of a base, the reaction could proceed even without light irradiation, while light irradiation was necessary in the absence of a base. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and provide energetic considerations

         <title>DMAPO/Boc2O&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot Direct N1&#8208;Acylation of Indazole with Carboxylic Acids: A Practical Synthesis of N1&#8208;Functionalized Alkyl Indazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

The anti&#8208;cryptophane&#8208;3 derivative sequesters cesium and thallium cations in aqueous solutions. This article describes the synthesis of the two enantiomers of compound 3 as well as the determination of their absolute configuration by VCD spectroscopy associated with DFT calculations. An ECD spectroscopy study assesses the ability of cesium and thallium to induce conformational changes in compound 3.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of the two enantiomers of a water&#8208;soluble cryptophane 3 enabling cesium and thallium complexation at neutral or basic pH. The two enantiomers of 3 were obtained in a two steps synthesis from cryptophane 4, a molecule decorated with three phenol groups and three other phenol groups protected by benzyl units. The two enantiomers of 4 were isolated from liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the two enantiomers of 3 was determined by vibrational circular dichroism combined with theoretical calculations. Contrary to cryptophane 1 that present large spectroscopic changes upon cesium and thallium complexation, the electronic circular dichroism spectra of compound 3 exhibit moderate spectral changes suggesting that this compound cannot change the conformation of its linkers as easily as cryptophane 1.

         <title>NIS/TEMPO&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Cyanation and Nitro&#8208;Mannich Reaction of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIS/TEMPO&#8208;mediated procedure for the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of tertiary amines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) and nitroalkanes was developed. The N&#8208;Mannich base formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium intermediate.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free N&#8208;iodosuccinimde (NIS)/2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO)&#8208;promoted protocol was developed for the oxidative cyanation and nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction of tertiary amines via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed; the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the C&#8722;N coupled intermediate (N&#8208;Mannich base) formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium cation.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Polyheterocycles from Nitroarenes and Glycols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process for the synthesis of N&#8208;polyheterocycles from easily available nitroarenes catalyzed by a dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex is described, where the byproduct generated in the first step is incorporated into the final structure. A broad variety of nitrogenated compounds are synthesized in overall good yields in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.

The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>SO2F2&#8208;Mediated Thioesterification of Carboxylic Acids with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article described the thioesterification of carboxylic acids with thiols through the activation of sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The presented one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol was compatible with aryl/alkyl carboxylic acid including drug molecules.







Abstract
The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules rac&#8208;Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram&#8208;scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Investigations on Superbase Mediated Reactivity of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones with Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations were made on the chemoselectivity in superbase&#8208;mediated reactions of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. Under super basic conditions, the reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl afforded 2&#8208;substituted quinoline while the reaction of former with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide furnished azine sulphonamides.







Abstract
We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of 2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.

         <title>Selective Transformation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclooctadiene into Novel Functionalized Azaheterocycles, &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters, and Lactams by Means of Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advance of 2&#8208;nitroglycals from 2014 to 2023. A plethora of applications on the synthesis of bioactive compounds via Michael&#8211;type addition, sugar ring opening reaction, Ferrier rearrangement were summarized. Organo&#8211;catalysis glycosylation plays a pivotal role in these applications.

2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advances of 2&#8208;nitroglycals including its synthetic methods and its applications. Using 2&#8208;nitroglycals, 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, nitro&#8208;polyol derivatives, sugar&#8208;furan derivatives, sugar&#8208;pyrrole molecules, 2,3&#8208;diaminoglycosides and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithioglycosides were obtained via Michael&#8211;type addition, retro&#8208;Henry&#8208;type reaction, C1/C3&#8208;Ferrier rearrangement and [3+2] N&#8208;heterocyclic addition. Most of these conversions are achieved via mild organo&#8208;catalysis glycosylation methods.

         <title>Towards the Stable Binding of Mercury: Synthesis and Functionalization of Dibenzyldiazabicyclononane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan&#8208;9&#8208;ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65&#8208;88%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C&#8208;9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in situ generated aryl radical is converted to alpha&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein we report the first microwave&#8208;assisted one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step metal&#8208;free [4+2] procedure for the synthesis of 5,6&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;hydrazinyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines directly from commercially available aromatic and heteroaromatic ketones. The 3&#8208;hydrazinyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine can be isolated or further elaborated, after a simple work&#8208;up, by direct condensation with different aldehydes or ketones to provide highly functionalized hydrazone&#8208;derivatives. This protocol represents a rapid, efficient, and sustainable approach for the development of new highly functionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazine derivatives with potential biological interest.

         <title>New Avenues for the Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;Cycles Using Lewis/Br&#248;nsted Acid Mediated Carboxygenation and Carboalkoxylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advancements in organic synthesis have witnessed a remarkable transformation through the functionalization of alkynes. In this review, important developments on the Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated strategies of 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the formation of oxa&#8208;cycles have been highlighted.







Abstract
The cascade functionalizations of alkynes have provided many elegant methods for the synthesis of useful scaffolds. Amongst these functionalizations, the ones comprising C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond formation have been utilized extensively due to the abundant presence of oxygenated motifs in various bio&#8208;active natural as well as unnatural products. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is a mainstay for these tandem functionalizations as they are very efficient. However, their utilization does typically involve stoichiometric additives like other metal salts and/or Lewis acids/Br&#248;nsted acids (LA/BA). Thus, approaches that rely solely on using LA/BA, make these vital transformations not only eco&#8208;friendly and atom economical but also cost beneficial are fast emerging as complementary alternatives. The present review addresses the gap in the literature by summarizing recent developments in LA/BA mediated 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;cycles. The reaction mechanisms are particularly emphasized to bring out understanding needed from the point of future developments in this domain.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with aryl aldehyde without an external photocatalyst was developed. By this protocol, various 3&#8208;acylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were generated under mild conditions in high yields with good functional group compatibility of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and aryl aldehydes. Mechanism studies revealed that the bromide radical (Br&#8901;) and bromomethyl radical (BrCH2&#8901;) generated from the homolytic cleavage of excited&#8208;state CH2Br2 maybe act as the hydrogen abstracting reagent during this process.

         <title>Imidazolium Dicyanomethylides as N&#8208;Ylide Precursors of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;ylides are conjugated mesomeric betaines with an exocyclic anionic carbon substituent. These ylides were converted by deprotonation into anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, which can be formulated with two negative charges on the carbene carbon atom due to their origin. Subsequent reaction with selenium gave anionic selenourea compounds.







Abstract
In the past, the use of nitrogen ylides focused primarily on cycloadditions, where the 1,3&#8208;dipole was used as a building block for the formation of heterocycles such as pyrroles or pyrrolinones. In this work, we present a new perspective on imidazolium dicyanomethylides with their synthesis and utilization as anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The values of relative carbene formation energies (CREF) for a wide range of substituted imidazolium ylides unknown in the literature showed promising properties. In situ trapping reactions of these anionic NHCs with selenium led to anionic, water&#8208;soluble compounds that exhibited remarkable coordination behavior according to X&#8208;ray structure analyses. In addition, the 77Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;&#8208;acceptance.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Hydroquinone Linked 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Steroid Dimers via a Modified Mitsunobu Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of O,O&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;linked saturated steroid dimers through a modified Mitsunobu protocol is described. The formation of hydroquinone dialkyl ethers from secondary alcohols (steroidal or nonsteroidal) requires the use of a three&#8208;component PBu3/TMAD/Et3N system in a non&#8208;polar solvent. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide range of products with potential biological activity.







Abstract
A successful approach for the construction of steroid dimers with a hydroquinone linker under PBu3/TMAD/Et3N/toluene conditions is described. This study provided a new one&#8208;step methodology for the design and synthesis of bis&#8208;steroidal 1,4&#8208;phenylene diethers using mild and effective reagents.

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aryl Diazonium Intermediates in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated diazonium intermediates, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in chemical biology.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium intermediates have emerged as highly versatile intermediates in modern organic synthesis and chemical biology, demonstrating remarkable reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Their significance has extended to DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs), where they serve as valuable alternatives to traditional aryl halide&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Aryl diazonium intermediates as N2&#8208;annulation synthons can efficiently transform into benzotriazinone core on DNA besides C&#8722;C coupling. This concept paper illuminates recent advances in this field, emphasizing their applications and potential across various facets of DELs, off&#8208;DNA chemistry, DELs selection, and DNA&#8208;based probes. It is anticipated that these developments will propel the broader utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated aryl diazonium salt intermediates in DELs, protein labeling, hit discovery, and other interdisciplinary fields.

         <title>EDA Complex from BCP&#8208;Thianthrenium Salt: A Catalyst&#8208;free Strategy To Access 1&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline Derivatives Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The construction of bicyclo[1.1.1.]pentanes (BCPs) typically require the cumbersome use of labile [1.1.1.]propellane in solution and involve multicomponent radical reactions, which commonly produce undesired by&#8208;products that hinder the efficient construction of BCPs. In this paper, we present a catalyst&#8208;free strategy by constructing an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron&#8208;deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl&#8208;BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm&#160;the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: a Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP&#160;constitutes&#160;a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction media&#160;are&#160;illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic&#160;ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces&#160;a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents&#160;are&#160;observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions&#160;by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high&#160;stereoselectivity, working at 0 &#176;C and under air.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#949;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8208;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation.

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of four different families of structurally&#8208;related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers, prepared by synthetic strategies involving Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols, was performed in chloroform solution (absorbance, photoluminescence) and spin&#8208;coated thin films (absorbance, photoluminescence, ECD, optical microscopy).







Abstract
Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diol (BDT) or 9H&#8208;carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols: a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone can result in very different solid&#8208;state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.

The asymmetric reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with naphthoquinone esters has been established with a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, providing a wide range of axially chiral naphthylpyrazole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with naphthoquinone esters has been established. A wide range of unprecedented axially chiral naphthylpyrazole derivatives (29&#8197;examples) have been synthesized in moderate to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as a catalyst. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, good scalability and facile derivatization. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted and 1&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Carbolines via 3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Acylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convenient methods are reported for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines from 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;acylindoles, which are accessible through two one&#8208;pot multistep reactions via oxomethylated benzenesulfonamide intermediates. The acylindoles are subsequently subjected to aminomethylenation with formamide derivatives or chemoselective reduction, followed by ring closure with ammonium salts.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Carbolines represent a large class of bioactive natural products, whereby most of these alkaloids bear residues at C1, and occasionally at C3, and only limited examples of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines are known. In this project we worked out a novel approach to 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines and performed a comprehensive analysis of the scope and limitations of this methodology. The 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines were synthesized via 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;acylindoles, for which effective synthesis procedures were developed. Our studies revealed that a broad range of target compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at C4 are accessible. Limitations of this method arose from competing CH and NH acidities of precursors. Nevertheless, the work described herein provides a unique approach to highly substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines. In addition, intermediates from this route opened a novel approach to 1&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines utilizing a chemoselective Mo(CO)6&#8208;catalyzed amide reduction with tetramethyldisiloxane.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be too sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!







Abstract
Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K=103&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of 1 could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst 6 which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles is disclosed that proceeds under additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction utilizes readily available alkenes as alkylating partners and delivers Markovnikov products with tolerance of sensitive functionalities.







Abstract
The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.

         <dc:description>An efficiently aerobic dehydrazination of arylhydrazines promoted by potassium tert&#8208;butoxide (tBuOK) is detailed in this study. This method smoothly produces aromatics analogues from arylhydrazines using catalytic amount of tBuOK under practical conditions, exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. The application potential of this approach is further demonstrated through the preparation of deuterated, iodinated and brominated aromatics. Moreover, it shows that this aerobic base&#8208;mediated dehydrazination could be utilized to prepare unsymmetrical aryl sulfides, selenides and tellurides with high efficiency.</dc:description>

The synthesized compounds were fully characterized by NMR and HR&#8208;MS, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied. The photoluminescence quantum yield of PCP&#9148;NAP, PCP&#9148;ANTH were determined to be 0.21, 0.50 and for PCP&#9148;TPE in aggregated state 0.31, respectively. PCP&#9148;TPE exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics when the water fraction was greater than 50% in THF/water mixtures. PCP&#9148;ANTH and PCP&#9148;TPE were also characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and single crystals of PCP&#9148;ANTH were obtained from the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group C2/c. A single crystal of PCP&#9148;TPE crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P&#9148;1, with one molecule residing at the inversion center. The observed properties of these &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers were compared with respect to through&#8208;space conjugation and conjugation length in the structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of C5&#8208;Indole Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via Diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the construction of C5&#8208;indole unnatural amino acid derivatives via the diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of racemic (DL), and enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208;carboxamides of amino acids with 5&#8208;iodoindoles. Independently, indole&#8208;based compounds and amino acid motifs are important small molecules in organic synthesis and drug discovery research. This report aimed to contribute to enriching the library of indole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives. The synthesis of examples of C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;installed amino acid derivatives comprising norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid having anti&#8208;stereochemistry was accomplished. The synthesis of the C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. The C&#8208;H arylation reactions of racemic and enantiopure carboxamides with 5&#8208;iodoindoles afforded the corresponding indole unnatural amino acid derivatives with good diastereoselectivity (anti, dr &gt;95:5 and enantiopurity (er up to 99:1). Removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline), phthalimide group and preparation of indole amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing indole unnatural amino acid motifs were also shown. The utility of the methodology was shown by synthesizing indole motif&#8208;containing pyrrolidone and peptide molecules. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound.</dc:description>

Independently, indole-based compounds and amino acid motifs are important small molecules in organic synthesis and drug discovery research. This report aimed to contribute to enriching the library of indole-based unnatural amino acid derivatives. The synthesis of examples of C5-indole motif-installed amino acid derivatives comprising norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine, 2-aminooctanoic acid having anti-stereochemistry was accomplished. The synthesis of the C5-indole motif-containing non-&#945;-amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. The C-H arylation reactions of racemic and enantiopure carboxamides with 5-iodoindoles afforded the corresponding indole unnatural amino acid derivatives with good diastereoselectivity (anti, dr &amp;gt;95:5 and enantiopurity (er up to 99:1). Removal of the directing group (8-aminoquinoline), phthalimide group and preparation of indole amino acid esters and free amino group-containing indole unnatural amino acid motifs were also shown. The utility of the methodology was shown by synthesizing indole motif-containing pyrrolidone and peptide molecules. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers was ascertained from the X-ray structure of a representative compound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>This review aims to highlight the role that computational chemistry has played in advancing the supramolecular chemistry field. We demonstrated recent uses of computational methodologies to elucidate noncovalent interactions in various processes occurring in supramolecular systems. We also emphasized the contributions of these techniques to studying reactions within confined space, showing how computational methodologies help clarify the effects of reactivity and conformational locking. Furthermore, we underscore the utilization of Molecular Dynamics (MD) in elucidating dynamical processes, understanding temperature and pressure effects, and exploring conformational space within supramolecular chemistry. Finally, we highlight the impact that the age of machine learning has on computational chemistry, showing how these universal approximators can enhance existing methods, predict properties, and efficiently explore the chemical space encompassed by these complex systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Free Sonogashira Coupling in Water and under Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling on aryl bromides can be carried out under micellar conditions, in the absence of copper(I) catalyst, and under ambient atmosphere. Key of the success is the use of Kolliphor EL, a surfactant capable to form oxygen&#8208;free lipophilic domains in water. The method is applied toward the preparation of both (hetero)arylalkynes and luminescent molecular materials.







Abstract
Sonogashira coupling is one of the cornerstone Palladium mediated cross coupling reactions, giving a direct and high yield access to symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric alkynes with high tolerance of substituents. The method generally requires the use of CuI as a cocatalyst, an inert atmosphere to protect palladium catalyst, somewhat harsh conditions like prolonged heating and the use of organic solvents due to the hydrophobicity of reagents and products. Leveraging on the opportunities offered by micellar catalysis, we here present a general methodology to perform Sonogashira coupling in water, with moderate or no heating, under air, without copper co&#8208;catalysts and at very low catalyst loading. The method offers the same generality and scope of organic solvents based couplings, but strongly improves sustainability while offering excellent yields.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Tertiary Alcohols with Lipase A from Candida Antarctica</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing vinyl hexanoate as an acyl donor with Na2CO3 is the key to substantially improving the reaction rate, substrate scope, and product stability in the KR of racemic tertiary alcohols using commercially available lipase A from Candida antarctica. The KR conditions were applied to cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane moieties, yielding esters with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic primary and secondary alcohols have been widely reported to produce esters with high enantiomeric purity. In contrast, similar KRs of tertiary alcohols have been reported for only a limited range of substrates and require prolonged reaction times of several days. To gain deeper insight into the substrate scope and increase the process efficiency, we examined the reaction conditions using commercially available immobilized lipase A from Candida antarctica and found that the addition of the heterogeneous, inorganic base sodium carbonate significantly increased the reaction rate while maintaining high enantioselectivity. The use of vinyl hexanoate as the acyl donor provided esters that were stable during chromatography purification. The optimized reaction conditions were then successfully applied to a range of cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane skeletons having, in part, a substituent on the aromatic ring. In this study on the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of enzymatic KR&#8208;type reactions, we achieved &gt;30&#8201;% conversion for various tertiary alcohols in 24&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, producing optically active esters with 88&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee.

A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access &#947;&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as catalysts in the presence of TFA.

Abstract
A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access &#947;&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using anthraquinone derivatives as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The best reaction results were obtained by using 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as a catalyst under 370&#8197;nm irradiation in an O2 environment. The scope and the limitations of this reaction have been investigated using both 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones, as well as enantiopure ketones, to obtain full preservation of their stereochemical identity after the oxidation. The process furnishes in most cases the desired compounds with high purity after catalyst removal by simple filtration, and reducing the production of solvents waste.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Enabling Cyanation of Electron&#8208;poor Carbons with Acetone Cyanohydrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pt&#8208;cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (Pt&#8208;HER) of acetone cyanohydrin provides an alternative method for introducing the cyano group onto electrophilic carbons of imines and chalcones. The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#946;&#8208;cyano ketones has been achieved smoothly with a small excess of cyanating agent (2 equivalent), catalytic amount of supporting electrolyte and low electricity consumption (0.02 F/mol). Besides demonstrating a general atom economy, the high Faradaic efficiency, allows for a scale&#8208;up with low&#8208;demanding electrochemical design and short electrolysis times.</dc:description>

Under strong superacidic conditions and with sufficient time cyclization of two (di)protonated molecules of DAMN is observed, yielding a tetracationic pyrazine species.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct and &#945;&#8208;selective protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation through traceless Staudinger ligation is successfully developed. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is comfirmed by an enzymatic degradation experiment and HPLC analysis using synthetic standards. This method enables the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields.







Abstract
Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55&#8201;%).

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high-spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non-benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2-b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high-spin non-benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs): Highly Nucleophilic Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high reactivity of 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines also known as 2&#8208;methylpyridinium derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (2&#8208;pyNHOs) has been recognized in organic synthesis, yet a quantification of their nucleophilicity is lacking. Herein we used stopped&#8208;flow photometry to determine the nucleophilicity of a series of 2&#8208;pyNHOs from the kinetics of their reactions with quinone methides and benzhydrylium ions as reference electrophiles in four organic solvents at 20 &#176;C. The kinetic data was evaluated by using the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k(20 &#176;C) = sN(N + E), which gave nucleophilicity parameters N (and sN). With N in the range of 19.4 to 21.2 (in DMSO), 2&#8208;pyNHOs exceed the reactivity of classical enamines, such as pyrrolidino&#8208;cyclopent&#8208;1&#8208;ene. The addition of 2&#8208;pyNHOs to quinone methides resulted in the formation of zwitterionic adducts with pyridinium and phenolate moieties. Subsequent tautomerization yielded entirely neutral pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;phenol species in several cases. Formation of the zwitterionic adducts from 2&#8208;pyNHOs and neutral electrophiles was almost equally fast in the polar solvents acetonitrile and DMSO, but proceeded one to two orders of magnitude slower in the less polar solvents dichloromethane or THF.</dc:description>

         <title>The Environmental Pollutant NO3&#8226; Rapidly Damages Alkene Moieties in Lipids Through Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of alkene moieties in fatty acids of (phospho)lipids and cholesterol derivatives makes them highly susceptible to damage by nitrate radicals (NO3&#8226;), potentially formed through simultaneous exposure to the environmental air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8226;) and ozone (O3). Absolute rate coefficients derived from reactions with simplified model systems range from 4 to 8 &#215; 109 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile, ranking among the highest determined for NO3&#8226; reactions with biomolecules in solution to date. Alkenes featuring an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl substituent also display notable reactivity with k values of (2.5 &#177; 1.0) &#215; 108 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Calculations suggest that these reactions are initiated by oxidative electron transfer (ET) involving the C=C bond, followed by recombination of the resulting alkene radical cation with nitrate anion (NO3&#8722;) to form the nitrate adduct radical as the kinetically controlled product. Conversely, saturated fatty acid derivatives and cholestanol react with NO3&#8226; through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with rate coefficients of 106 &#8211; 107 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, indicating that biomolecules with a considerable number of non&#8208; or moderately activated sp3 C&#8211;H bonds are also highly susceptible to NO3&#8226; attack. These findings underscore the potential health hazards associated with exposure to combined NO2&#8226; and O3 gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8211;N(CO) Axis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8213;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8213;N(CO) (sp2&#8213;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8213;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8225; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8225; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8225; value.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to 3&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a 4&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo&#8208;exciplex (1.2:1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines emit intense blue luminescence, suggesting their possible use as emitter molecules in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. We synthesized several new imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and found they possessed a characteristic hypsochromic effect and even increased quantum efficiency compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, as measured by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy in solution. The energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were calculated using density functional theory and experimentally determined by cyclic voltammetry in solution.

For 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline, a quantum yield of 33% was obtained at an even shorter emission wavelength of 431 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;C5&#8208;Arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles with Aryl Chlorides Promoted by Bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles with challenging aryl chloride substrates is promoted by the use of a specifically designed electron&#8208;rich ferrocenyl diphosphane. This protocol employs 0.5 to 1.0 mol% catalyst loading without any additives such as copper or ammonium salts, and equally tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halides, as illustrated by the efficient synthesis in 86% yield of the anti&#8208;tubercular agent PHOXPY (2&#8208;(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine) from a late&#8208;stage arylation using 2&#8208;chloropyrazine.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes through the formation of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters by the ring opening of 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones in the presence ofa catalytic amount of TPP under mild reaction conditions. Initially, PPh3 activates the diarylcyclopropenone to generate the phosphonium adduct, which simultaneously reacts with 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins to afford the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters instead of Wittig olefination. Subsequently, these &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters undergo a smooth Friedel&#8208;Crafts type cyclization with arenes in the presence of AlCl3 to give a new series of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones in good to excellent yields. Additionally, the reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters with NaBH4 followed by the acid catalyzed cyclization of resulting allylic alcohols afforded the 2&#8208;arylindenes in good yields. This is the first report on the use of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as precursors for diarylindanones and arylindenes synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications.

         <title>Topological Structural Chemistry of Fused Bicycloalkanes Allowing Homeomorphic Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused bicycloalkanes have&#160;several structures with different orientation of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversion between certain structures, for instance an out,out&#8208;structure convert to an in,in&#8208;structure. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macroring. In this report, topological structural chemistry of fused bicycloalkanes and their analogues allowing homeomorphic conversions were&#160;reviewed. Although the concept of homeomorphism in fused bicycloalkanes was proposed 50 years ago, comprehensive researches on their structural chemistry are still ongoing. These understandings are highly relevant to the fundamentals of many fields of chemistry, including structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, natural products chemistry, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles has been described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source, and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion, still remains momentous, yet challenging. Herein, we report a Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by&#160;Cu(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrroles in up to 81% yield under green reaction conditions. The possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles can be available via N&#8208;alkylation, and the preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation is also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the first total synthesis of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8208;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8208;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83:17 er observed, showing that nickel complexes of Phim&#8208;type PN ligands are superior to those derived from Phox&#8208;type ligands.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation of isocyanoacetates with vinyl aziridines has been developed. The reaction condition was suitable to a variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl isocyanoacetates as well as N&#8208;substituted vinyl aziridines, affording the corresponding allylation products in moderate to high yields (up to 98%) along with excellent&#160;stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. The transformations of the allylation product into trans&#8208;4,5&#8208;dehydrolysine analogy and highly functionalized proline ester derivative were further demonstrated. In addition, preliminary asymmetric version has also been evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based Hydroxyurethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New furan, carvone and limonene&#8208;based carbamates have been synthesized with high regioselectivity under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a detailed study on the reaction conditions allowed for the drastic reduction of the TBD loading with almost no effect on the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of carbamates from bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates and amines by using 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) as an organocatalyst is reported. This methodology led to the preparation of a wide range of bio&#8208;sourced hydroxyurethanes from furan&#8208;, carvone&#8208; and limonene&#8208;based scaffolds under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the process allowed us to optimize the catalyst loading with little or no impact on the process regioselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4 Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic analogue of lipoxin B4 containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved via the design of a key BCP&#8208;containing fragment that could be used as a common intermediate in the synthesis of the target analogue as well as other heteroaromatic congeners.







Abstract
Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study. Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.

         <title>Dielectrophilic Approach to Sequential Heterofunctionalization of Ethylene from Vinylthianthrenium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylthianthrenium salt was employed as the starting material for a formal difunctionalization of ethylene. Its 1,2&#8208;dielectrophilic property enables the sequential incorporation of two distinct nucleophiles onto ethylene. Through this method, we achieve the formation of a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;X bond (X=N, O, halogen) on ethylene, in a single step performed under mild conditions.







Abstract
Vinyl thianthrenium salt is a compound with interesting electrophilic properties capable of reacting with two distinct nucleophiles. By using &#946;&#8208;keto esters as one of the reaction partners, it is possible to insert a chain of two carbon atoms with a further functionalization under mild conditions. We have studied this new methodology which involves the stepwise formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;X bond (with X=N, O, etc.) in one step without the use of metals. Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.

         <dc:description>A mini review focused on the chemistry of selenosulfones reported since 2019 is here presented. Initially, methods aimed to the preparation of such moiety are discussed. Successively 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;addition reactions to C&#8208;C single and multiple bonds are illustrated. The third chapter deals with C&#8208;H functionalizations while the fourth one shows the reactions with aryl diazonium salts or its precursors. The radical coupling with redox active reagents, is the subject of section five. Selenosulfones challenged in nucleophilic substitutions and in reactions with phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds are shown in chapter six and seven followed by the conclusions and perspectives section.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes Using 2&#8208;Mercaptothiazolinium Salts as Alkyl Radical Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical heteroarylation of 2&#8209;mercaptothiazolinium salts with N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields. Various alkyl bromides were converted conveniently into redox&#8208;active thiazolinium salts and subsequently into alkyl radicals by reaction with an excited&#8208;state photocatalyst. This mild protocol permits efficient functionalization of various N&#8208;heteroarenes with a wild range of cyclic and acyclic primary and secondary alkyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydroxyethylation of Phenols with Renewable Ethylene Glycol Diester as an Alternative to Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyol esters are abundant bio&#8208;based resources. Integration of polyol esters into the production chain of fine chemicals would reduce carbon emission and improve the sustainability of the chemical industry. An efficient synthetic route towards phenoxyethanols was developed through catalytic hydroxyethylation of phenols with ethylene glycol diacetate as the reagent. This method showed the potential of ethylene glycol diester as a safe and sustainable substitute for ethylene oxide, a useful but toxic reagent. A variety of phenoxyethanol esters were produced in high yield under simple catalytic conditions. Mechanism studies revealed the reaction underwent a neighboring group participation process.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to achieve for addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction, according a series of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with good yields and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process. This methodology demonstrates significant potential for the synthesis of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide skeleton, which possesses biological or pharmaceutical activity.

         <title>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;Sulfonamide Synthesis by SN2 Reaction&#8211;Oxidation Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade reaction for synthesizing heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines is described. The methodology has broad scope, affording heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides in moderate to good yields, and was applied to the synthesis of H3B&#8208;968, a potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor.







Abstract
Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale. A potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor H3B&#8208;968 was also synthesized by this method.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Monofluoromethylthioesters from Acyl Chlorides with Elemental Sulfur and Fluoroiodomethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S8) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH2F) as the CH2F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report an unprecedented Ni-catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S8) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH2F) as the CH2F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields. This approach features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the late-stage monofluoromethylthiolation of complex bioactive molecules can also be accomplished using this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Photocatalysis Applied to Oxidative Amidation of Aldehydes with NaCl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthesis of amides from aldehydes promoted by the photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as chlorine source, Na2S2O8 as a benign oxidant is reported. The reaction is mediated by visible&#8208;light and is carried out at room temperature in absence of additives. Fe2SO4 is a readily available earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAMs) salt, not needed to be prepared and is environmentally sustainable. Both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and mono&#8208; and disubstituted amines have been texted in this transformation. This report opens intriguing perspectives for extendeding application of photoactive complex iron salts toward halogenation processes as well as for C&#8208;H activations and gives a contribution to the field of earth&#8208;abundant metals based&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Key Players for Amide and Sulfonamide Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable protocol has been devised for the oxidation of activated secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, as well as their utilization as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives. These reactions proceed smoothly and in good yields (up to 98%) when conducted in Fe&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which serve dual roles as solvents and catalysts. Operating under mild (40 &#176;C) and aerobic conditions, these transformations are completed within a 4 h time frame. A pharmacologically relevant amide derivative, specifically a PMRT1 inhibitor, has also been successfully synthesized on a 3 g&#8208;scale utilizing a reusable FeCl3&#183;6H2O/glycerol Lewis acidic DES.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism and White Light Emission of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane Compared with 1,3,5,7&#8208;Tetraphenyladamantane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted diamondoid polymorphs were identified and show different white&#8208;light emission spectra upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The polymorphicity arises from a competition of London dispersion interactions either as short CH&#8211;&#960; or Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts.







Abstract
Here we report our investigation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane (1) and the elucidation of polymorphic crystals (1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B) using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;A (P21/n), we observed CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are absent. Conversely, the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are an apparent factor in the formation of the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;B (R
). We compare our findings with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyladamantane (2), characterized by numerous CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in the solid. Computational analyses were employed to investigate the interactions within the characteristic dimers present in the unit cells of 1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B, including visualization of noncovalent interactions and the use of the atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules approach as well as MO analyses. These support the notion of London dispersion (LD) dimer&#8208;dimer interactions in 1&#8201;A between the phenyl moieties, whereas 1&#8201;B exhibits additional dimer&#8208;dimer Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts. In contrast, the crystals of 2 are exclusively held together by CH&#8211;&#960; stacking LD interactions, a feature absent in the polymorphs of 1. Both polymorphic forms of 1 emit white light when subjected to 900&#8197;nm continuous wave laser irradiation, displaying a subtle blue shift compared to 2. The absence of CH&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the dimers of 1 causes a small red&#8208;shift in the emission spectrum.

         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of b&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promotor under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be constructed by the further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features operationally simple, excellent functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#949;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two AIE&#8208;active analogues, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, with different N&#8208;heterocyclic rings were synthesized. Compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF with a larger N&#8208;heterocyclic ring showed an increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) by a factor of around 10 in the solid as well as more multifunctional applications, such as mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability.







Abstract
Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0&#8201;% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28&#8201;%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35&#8197;&#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibited a smaller RMSD, which indicated a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;halogenated carbonyl compounds has been performed by exploiting four different melanin polymers in the role of photocatalyst. The reaction smoothly took place under visible light irradiation in the presence of sodium ascorbate as an additive. The melanin obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid offered the best performance, especially in the reduction of brominated substrates.







Abstract
Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model &#945;&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.

         <title>Pd&#8208;catalysed indirect and regioselective phosphonation of azobenzenes: toward the design of water&#8208;soluble photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient palladium&#8208;catalysed ortho C&#8208;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethyl phosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalisation tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.</dc:description>

Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late-stage ortho-functionalisation tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water-soluble azo-photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z-isomer half-life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Chloroamination Cyclization Cascade with Sodium Hypochlorite: from N&#8209;(Pentenyl)sulfonylamides to 2&#8209;(1&#8208;Chloromethyl)pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and catalyst&#8208;free protocol to obtain several 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines by the use of a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite is here reported, without the need for a light source. The choice of the solvent revealed to be crucial in the success of the reaction. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, confirmed a radical mechanism, where the deprotonation step, followed by the oxidation of a N&#8208;centered anion to the corresponding radical, allowed 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines, by a very fast cyclization, to be obtained. Sodium hypochlorite plays the role of both the oxidant and the chlorine source.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of Glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;Bis(NHC) Complexes in a Model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The authors of this work have optimized a novel synthetic route towards glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;bis(NHC) complexes in only 4 steps with total yields up to 73&#160;%. The synthesis route encompasses an Appel reaction towards 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;glucopyranosides, followed by acyl&#8208;protection, then quaternization with imidazoles and finally the conversion of these acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium salts to their respective palladium(II)bis(NHC) complexes, via an intermediary silver(I) complex. Overall, 11 acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium iodides as NHC&#8208;precursors and 15 complexes have been synthesized. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of different functionalizations in these complexes and their reactivity in a model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura between bromobenzene and 4&#8208;tolueneboronic acid reaction has been investigated, and a highly reactive complex leading to &gt;99&#160;% yield at 0.005&#160;mol% catalytic loading has been found.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8211;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8208;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8226;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorene and Fluorenone Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via Diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of a &#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester affording 14 novel examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams in good yields (up to 80 %). The Pd&#8208;catalysed DAAA was optimised with the 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl&#8208;containing substrate. Using (S,S)&#8208;DACH&#8208;phenyl Trost as the optimal chiral ligand, enantioselectivities of up to 82 % ee were obtained. A substrate scope of 11 examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest ees, whereas products not bearing this substitution pattern showed lower enantioselectivities (&lt; 60 % ee). Transition states to rationalise the observed stereochemical outcome are proposed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8208;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8208;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;step sequence leads to the preparation of a series of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 homologues which are interesting compounds with potential biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The synthetic sequence involves the application of the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step for the preparation of a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains of different length and a phenyl group. These intermediates are obtained upon direct irradiation (254 nm) of 4&#8208;phenoxyphenyl esters in different solvents at room temperature. Then, reaction of the 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoethoxy)tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) reaction and, finally, nucleophilic attack with potassium selenocyanate provides the target aryloxyethyl selenocyanate homologues in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8722;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending of the nucleophile.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry can bring together simple components to create complex self&#8208;assembled materials. This strategy is so far under&#8208;investigated in the field of optoelectronic and energy materials. However, it has the potential to rapidly produce self&#8208;assembled organic semiconductors or stimuli responsive devices. Herein, we highlight the advantages of the dynamic covalent approaches and their limitations when applied to this field.







Abstract
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.

         <title>Double Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine&#8208;shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.







Abstract
A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic route comprising a biocatalyzed benzoin condensation reaction and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The obtained pyrazines were tested for their potential leishmanicidal and antiplasmodial activity in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel anti&#8208;protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the Leishmania and Plasmodium genera and using the human cell line HepG2.

         <title>[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.







Abstract
Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds meet DMSO, a unique platform is set up to manipulate sulfonium chemistry. A case study of oxidation of alcohols to ketones is shown herein. Crucial trifluoromethoxysulfonium is initially generated, and reacts with alcohols to give new alkoxysulfonium species via ligand exchange. Subsequent base&#8208;promoted E2 elimination gives ketones with the release of Me2S.







Abstract
In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of para&#8208;unsubstituted N&#8208;arylpropynamides proceeds using readily available hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidant and potassium halides as halogen source under aqueous medium. This method shows a broad substrate scope and doesn't require any metal catalysts.







Abstract
We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn't require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.

The arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones was investigated under Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions involving ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis, the results of which showed that the reaction proceeds chemoselectively with the formation of S&#8208;arylation products.

Abstract
We investigated the S&#8208;arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones under ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis employing Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions. We determined optimal reaction conditions and assessed the impact of substituents in the arylating agent on the reaction progress. Notably, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) in the aryl halide facilitated the reaction even without a catalyst. In particular, an EWG in the para position of the aromatic ring exerted a directing effect on the leaving group, regardless of the halogen present.

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalyzed, TBHP&#8208;Mediated Modular Three&#8208;Component Cascade Towards Highly Functionalized Pyrrole via [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole under the metal&#8208;free condition catalyzed by TBAI/TBHP was demonstrated. &#946;&#8208;Enaminone generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to synthesize penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles.







Abstract
A facile, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole employing TBAI/TBHP has been developed from readily available precursors. &#946;&#8208;Enaminones generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines react sequentially with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes via a radical pathway to form the penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to good yields. This strategy for the synthesis of highly functionalized pyrroles can be scaled up and shows tolerance to a variety of amines.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and N&#8208;sulfonylaminopyridinium salts is developed. This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N&#8208;centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.

         <title>A New Strategy for the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Crambescin B Decarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Crambescin B decarboxylate was synthesized using a new synthetic strategy, which is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined its cytotoxicity and protective effects in neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. Additionally, the compound protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
Crambescin B decarboxylate is an inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels and a potential biochemical tool. Herein, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of crambescin B decarboxylate using a new synthetic strategy. The key aspects of this new protocol include: 1) the use of an optically pure epoxide, synthesized by the Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, as the starting material for guanidino&#8208;aziridine, and 2) the introduction of the THF ring through nucleophilic substitution using an acyl anion equivalent. The synthetic protocol reported herein is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined the cytotoxicity and protective effects of crambescin B decarboxylate in mouse&#8208;hippocampus&#8208;derived neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. In addition, crambescin B decarboxylate protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization reaction of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines is reported with HFIP.







Abstract
We reveal here a catalyst&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing &#947;&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plunger&#8208;based device has been developed for the automated mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions in a 5&#8197;mm tube inside a standard NMR probe. The plunger design, plunger velocity, settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis to determine the optimum parameters for reaction kinetics to be monitored in&#8208;situ.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of in&#8208;situ NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5&#8197;mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine ex&#8208;situ analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.

Abstract
We present a method for the synthesis of substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;ones starting from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles. The transformation involves gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position.

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of S&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the in&#8208;situ formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.







Abstract
A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Minisci&#8211;Type Cyanoalkylation of Azauracils via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils and cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8722;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.

         <title>Practical and Divergent Synthesis of Carbocyclic Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy has been applied for the synthesis of carbocyclic pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. The analogues were synthesized at the very last stage to provide swift access to a concise set of compounds. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed low micromolar activity against Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesiense.







Abstract
A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion via a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed the synthesis of a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed through a base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy into the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.

The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;Derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo&#8208;retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO2 furnishes bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2 in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R or S) and an amino acid (D or L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2 results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo-retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; furnishes bio-derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.

         <dc:description>
We have developed a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component strategy for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of &#945;&#8208;imino ketones with imidazopyridines under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction did not require any inert conditions and proceeded at room temperature in the open flask.







Abstract
We report here a catalyst&#8208;free, (sp2)C&#8722;H imination reaction of in&#8208;situ formed imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones. This one&#8208;pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2&#8208;diketones are also described.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <dc:description>
The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones were prepared. Their facile synthesis relies on arylboronic acids for boron incorporation, enabling significant structural diversity, dual&#8208;state emission, and reversible electrochemical reductions. Donor&#8208;acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300&#8197;nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
