      <title>Synthesis of Novel Chiral Spiroisoxazolidine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactams from 6&#8208;Alkylidenepenicillanates: A 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a library of 6&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams, derived from 6&#8208;aminopenicillanic acid is reported. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of these 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates with nitrones was explored as an approach to synthesize novel chiral spiroisoxazolidine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams. Quantum chemical calculations, at the DFT level of theory, were carried out to elucidate the 3D structure of the synthesized compounds. The reported methodology, which involves the generation of three new consecutive stereogenic centers, proved to be regio&#8208; and stereoselective leading to novel chiral spiroisoxazolidine&#8208;penicillanates efficiently.</dc:description>

      <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Amidation of 2&#8208;Aryl Quinazolinones Using Nitrene Surrogates</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective modifications of quinazolinones constitute a pivotal topic in drug discovery and material science. Herein, we describe the rhodium(III)&#8208; and iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amidation of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with a range of nitrene surrogates including dioxazolones, organic azides, and N &#8208;methoxyamides. Complete site&#8208;selectivity and functional group tolerance are observed. Notably, the large&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization highlight the synthetic potential of the developed protocol. Combined mechanistic investigations elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism of this process.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Electrochemical Coupling of Vinyl Azides: Synthesis of Phenanthridines and &#946;&#8209;Ketosulfones</title>
      <dc:description>We reported an efficient and environmentally benign electrochemical synthesis of phenanthridines by oxidative coupling of vinyl azides with sodium azide or benzenesulfonyl hydrazides, for the first time. The reaction conditions are mild, and no additional metal&#8208;catalyst or exogenous oxidants are needed. The protocol has a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, this green electrochemical procedure can be readily extended to the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones. Gram scale reactions further demonstrate the practicability.</dc:description>

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

      <title>Isobenzofurans as Synthetic Intermediates: Synthesis and Biological Activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Ajudazol B.</title>
      <dc:description>Ajudazol B is a polyketide secondary metabolite, isolated from the myxobacterium  Chondromyces crocatus  , that exhibits potent biological activity. Here we report a convergent total synthesis of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B. The key step is a regio&#8208;selective alkylation and oxidative rearrangement of a reactive isobenzofuran intermediate that generates the isochromanone core. This approach provides a fast and efficient method to synthesise analogues of ajudazol B from simple aldehydes, allowing assessment of structure&#8208;activity relationships. The antifungal activity of 8&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;ajudazol B as well as that of related analogues has been assessed using  Botrytis cinerea  . The results indicate that the isochromanone unit is key for antifungal activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
      <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.

      <title>A new phenanthroline ligand and the spontaneous resolution of its homoleptic copper(I) complex</title>
      <dc:description>During the synthesis of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives sterically hindered in the 2 and/or 9 positions, serendipity led to the discovery of a new substitution pattern on phenanthroline with good and reproducible yields.

      <title>Conformational lock of glycosyl donors using cyclic carbamates.</title>
      <dc:description>Axial rich glycosyl donors often display superior reactivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylations. In this study, a glucosamine glycosyl donor locked in a  1  C  4  conformation using a six&#8208;membered carbamate ring, i.e. an oxazinone, is synthesized and studied. The 2  N  ,4  O  carbamate is synthesized in one step from the corresponding azide. The glycosylation properties was studied by glycosylating different alcohols. Derivatives of the glycosyl donor were synthesized by introducing Ac, Troc, Ts and Ms groups on the oxazinone nitrogen. The ring opening to give the glycoside in the  4  C  1  conformation was found to proceed smoothly using Zempl&#233;n conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Method for the Divergent Synthesis of C&#8208;9 Functionalised Sialic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Sialic acids, a ubiquitous family of sugars shown to be involved in numerous biologically important processes, exhibit remarkable structural diversity in nature. Access to these derivatives by chemical and enzymatic means is a major bottle neck in understanding the role played by each particular modification. As part of a program to study such roles and determine the substrate specificity of novel sialic acid aldolases, a general and robust synthetic protocol was devised to gain access to all naturally occurring C&#8208;9 functionalised  N&#8208;  acetylneuraminic acid derivatives including esters. These derivatives were synthesised in 11 linear steps from a common advanced intermediate, which allowed for divergent modification at the C&#8208;9 position. Four substitutions were installed in this study: O&#8208;acetyl, O&#8208;lactyl, O&#8208;SO  3  , O&#8208;PO  3  . This synthetic pathway includes both an effective way to benzylate neuraminic acid derivatives, as well as a working methodology towards &#946;&#8208;linked neuraminic acid glycosides.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Harzialactone A and Its Three Stereoisomers by Use of Standardized Polyketide Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
  The Harzialactone A synthesis utilizes a Horner&#8211;Wittig&#8208;reaction of the chiral building block and benzaldehyde in the first step. The formed &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone can be selectively transformed into the syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;diol, which is further converted into the desired natural compound by ozonolysis, cyclization and oxidation in one step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this paper, we present a short and convenient synthesis of the natural product Harzialactone A and its three stereoisomers. In a three&#8208;step synthesis starting from cheap and commercially available benzaldehyde, we created the small polyketidic compound with full control over its two stereogenic centers. To this end, we employed a chiral building block previously described by us, introducing the first stereogenic center through a Horner&#8211;Wittig reaction. The second stereogenic center was installed via stereocontrolled syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;reduction with the corresponding &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone intermediates. Upon ozonolysis followed by oxidation the natural product and its stereovariants were produced with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereopurities.

      <title>Calcium carbide: versatile synthetic applications, green methodology and sustainability</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations. However, critical analysis of practical considerations showed that application of gaseous acetylene in regular synthetic labs encounters a number of difficulties.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations. However, critical analysis of practical considerations showed that application of gaseous acetylene in regular synthetic labs encounters a number of difficulties.

      <title>Isomerisation of vinyl sulfones for the stereoselective synthesis of vinyl azides</title>
      <dc:description>Reported is the construction, and facile base&#8208;mediated conversation of ten differently substituted 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones (&#947;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sulfones) into their isomeric vinyl azide counterparts. The requisite 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones were prepared from 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones, which in turn were accessed from allyl sulfones via a bromination&#8208;elimination sequence. In relation to this a one&#8208;pot azidation&#8208;isomerisation sequence was developed which enabled the direct formation of the vinyl azides from the corresponding 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones. Similarly, a convenient one&#8208;pot Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination&#8208;isomerisation approach was utilised in order to prepare some of the allylic sulfones used in this study. The vinyl azide forming process typically proceeded with high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity, although this was dependent on the vinyl sulfone substitution pattern. Thus, with either no substituent or a methyl group in the &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, relative to the sulfone, good, to high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity ( Z:E = 85:15 to &#8805;95:5) were obtained. However, incorporation of an &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl methyl substituent led to an E &#8208;selective process ( Z:E = 20:80). A non&#8208;bonding interaction between the azido group and the &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl vinylic proton is proposed, which acts as a conformational control mechanism to help guide the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Cyclic Azomethine Ylides in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions within the Molecular Electron Density Theory</title>
      <dc:description>The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reactions of cyclic azomethine ylides with a series of acetylene derivatives have been studied within the Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT). Analysis of the Conceptual DFT indices allows characterising the ambiphilic character of these cyclic AYs, thus participating as strong electrophiles and strong nucleophiles in polar 32CA reactions. Analysis of the activation enthalpies associated with the 32CA reactions of these cyclic AYs are found in reasonable agreement with the experimental outcomes. These reactions take place  via  a one&#8208;step mechanism. The 32CA reactions with 1&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;propyne and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate take place through highly asynchronous polar transition states (TSs). On the other hand, the strain present in cyclooctyne allows explaining its participation in a non&#8208;polar 32CA reaction  via  a synchronous TS. The present MEDT study allows establishing that the substitution in these cyclic AYs changes their parent  pseudodiradical&#8208;type  reactivity to the zwitterionic&#8208;type one.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Mobility and Efficiency in Supramolecular Catalysis. A Computational Approach to Evaluate the Performances of Enzyme Mimics.</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, we apply a computational approach, based on DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the catalytic behavior of four supramolecular catalysts active in the cleavage of phosphodiesters. The QM data indicate the operation of a synchronous associative mechanism with limited differences in the structures and energies of the transition states. The comparison with the experimental data, expressed in terms of effective molarity (EM), suggests that the difference in catalytic performance are not ascribable to a difference in the enthalpy of activation. On the other hand, the analysis of the Molecular Dynamics trajectories clearly indicates the conformational mobility, and therefore the conformational entropy, to be at the origin of the superior catalytic efficiency of the catalysts based on a more preorganized structure. Essentially, the combined method presented here provides, at a limited computational cost, a tool that is simple, general, and potentially suited for a large variety of catalytic systems to rationalize their performances and to predict those of enzyme mimics to be synthesized in a rational design process.</dc:description>

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

  &lt;p&gt;Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

Organic syntheses are increasingly relying on NHC catalysis, and this minireview highlights developments in NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that, over the past two decades, have been used as key steps in the total syntheses of natural products.

      <title>Regioselective Olefination of 3&#8208;Substituted Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Achieving site selectivity in the olefination of heteroarenes constitutes a highly attractive yet often challenging synthetic target. Herein we discuss the development of catalyst systems for the regioselective functionalization of 3&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered heteroarenes, which constitute particularly challenging substrates due to competing effects favoring different positions and are therefore attractive systems to prove strategies in catalyst design.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Five&#8208;membered heteroarenes constitute ubiquitous moieties in bioactive compounds and materials. It is thus not surprising that a direct and selective access to multiply substituted heteroarenes is considered as a highly attractive synthetic target. The direct olefination of such substrates, also known as cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has raised significant interest in this context. However, achieving site&#8208;selectivity remains challenging with some substitution patterns such as 3&#8208;substituted heteroarenes. Suitable catalyst systems and reaction conditions have to be identified, which enable the differentiation between the competing C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;position. Over the last few years, substantial progress has been made to overcome this selectivity challenge mainly based on the use of novel ligand systems, which will be described herein.

      <title>Application of Chiral Sulfinamides into Formation and Reduction of Sulfinylketimines to Obtain Valuable &#945;&#8208;Chiral Primary Amines</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview focuses on the use of sulfinamides as chiral auxiliaries in a condensation/reduction process to give access to &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amines. This paper gives an overview of all the methodologies developed around this process including metal hydride and transition metal reduction reactions, and of the application of these methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active chiral compounds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Chiral sulfinamides are very valuable, commercially available, and easy to handle chiral auxiliaries. One of the most interesting transformations that can be performed with a chiral sulfinamide is its condensation onto a ketone to form a chiral sulfinylketimine, followed by a reduction to obtain an &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amine. We review here all the methodologies developed around this condensation/reduction transformation. In the second part, we survey applications of these newly developed methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active compounds, including multikilogram scale synthesis.

  Polyenals and polyenones are simple chemical compounds which can be constructed into large and complex structures by virtue of aminocatalysis. In the past eight years, new aminocatalytic activation modes based on trienamine, cross&#8208;trienamine, tetraenamine, iminium ion, and vinylogous iminium ion intermediates have attracted great attention in the field of asymmetric synthesis. Key to the increasing focus is their inherent ability to allow functionalization of remote sites with excellent stereoselectivities. Moreover, methodologies involving one&#8208;pot, cascade or multicomponent strategies have been developed through the combination of these new activation modes with classical activation modes. In the course of expanding the applicability of organocatalysis, polyenals and polyenones have been introduced as simple and novel substrates, which have enabled the discovery of new concepts for the synthesis of many diverse and complex privileged structures.

      <dc:description>
  This minireview summarises the field of inorganic nanocatalysts applied to 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and emphases the various metals involved, their structure, characterisation, recyclability, and their preparation. Emphasis has also been given to improvements with respect to cycloadditions performed with the usual (non&#8208;nano) catalysts. For the sake of clarity, the results were summarised according to the 1,3&#8208;dipole type, namely, azomethine ylides, azomethine imines, nitrone, nitrilimine, and azides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine&#8208;ylides and &#8208;imines, nitrones, nitrilimines, and azides catalysed by inorganic nanoparticles are described. Emphasis is given to the nanometric catalysts involved, their structure, characterisation, and recyclability and, when remarkable, their preparation. Whenever possible, the improvements with respect to cycloadditions performed with the usual (non&#8208;nano) catalysts are discussed.

      <title>Determination of the Absolute Configurations of Chiral Alkanes &#8211; An Analysis of the Available Tools</title>
      <dc:description>
  Handy it is to know how to determine the absolute configurations of even the most challenging chiral molecules, in particular alkanes, which are reviewed here. An evaluation of common analytical methods for absolute configuration determination provides a guide for experimental chemists to analyze their own molecules of interest.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Knowledge of absolute configurations (ACs) is crucial to understand the properties and functions of chiral molecules. Although the development of asymmetric reactions has enabled access to a large variety of enantioenriched compounds, stereochemical assignments of chiral molecules, especially chiral alkanes, remain challenging. In this Minireview, we first summarize common analytical techniques for AC determination with a focus on chiral alkanes as analytical targets. Next, we describe some of our efforts over the last 20 years on syntheses and AC determination of chiral alkanes including [123]tetramantane, hexadeuterated neopentane, and trans&#8208;perhydroazulene. Lastly, microscopic techniques and the crystalline sponge method are discussed as particularly promising approaches to revolutionize the field of stereochemical analysis.

      <title>Site&#8208;Specific N2&#8208;dG DNA Adducts: Formation, Synthesis, and TLS Polymerase&#8208;Mediated Bypass</title>
      <dc:description>
  Damages in DNA are a constant threat to the genome. Especially, N2&#8208;dG DNA adducts can have strong implications on the biological processes. A reliable and rapid access to various N2&#8208;dG modified oligonucleotides can be achieved. These modified DNAs can help in understanding the TLS polymerase&#8208;mediated accurate tolerance for maintaining genomic stability.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The N2&#8208;position of deoxyguanosine (dG) in DNA is susceptible to modification by various damaging agents. These modifications (lesions or adducts) can stall the DNA replication by replicative polymerases, and if the common DNA repair pathways do not remove them, it can result in genomic instability. This generally leads to the death or oncogenic transformation of the cell. An important mechanism to deal with this problem is Translesion synthesis (TLS), a bypass mechanism, which involves the tolerance of DNA damage by low&#8208;fidelity DNA polymerases (TLS polymerases). To understand the accuracy of TLS polymerases, a chemical biology approach is required. In this review, we discuss the reliable methods to synthesize specific N2&#8208;dG DNA adducts and how they are tolerated by bacterial TLS polymerase Pol IV and its mammalian orthologue hpol &#954;. Molecular insights on the accurate bypass of these adducts emerge from the primer extension assays, X&#8208;ray crystallographic, and molecular modeling studies are reviewed here.

      <title>Facile Synthetic Route to [3.n]Thiacyclophanes through Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis and their Structural Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Here, we are reporting a simple synthetic strategy for the synthesis of thiacyclophanes by using the Grignard reaction and ring&#8208;closing metathesis as key steps. The structures are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal XRD diffraction studies and compared with computationally optimized structures.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We report a useful synthetic strategy to assemble constrained [3.n] thiacyclophanes using Grignard reaction and Ti(OiPr)4 assisted ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). This method is viable to access para, metapara, and meta isomers of thiacyclophanes. The structures of thiacyclophanes were confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and compared with computationally optimized structures. It is implied that out of four methods (ab initio and DFT), MP2/6&#8208;31G (d,p) is reasonably a better method for predicting structural parameters for this class of thiacyclophanes.

      <title>A One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 3&#8208;Fold C&#8211;N Bond Coupling Strategy to the Synthesis of Substituted Benzimidazoles</title>
      <dc:description>
  One&#8208;pot reaction leading to direct access to biologically relevant heterocycles is highly recommended in chemical synthesis. One such standout method, manifold C&#8211;N bond formations route to the synthesis of benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazoles, is described.

     alt="A One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 3&#8208;Fold C&#8211;N Bond Coupling Strategy to the Synthesis of Substituted Benzimidazoles"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One&#8208;pot reaction leading to direct access to biologically relevant heterocycles is highly recommended in chemical synthesis. One such standout method, manifold C&#8211;N bond formations route to the synthesis of benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]benzimidazoles, is described. Our methodology involves a copper catalyzed intramolecular C&#8211;N coupling of &lt;i&gt;N,N'&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;bromophenyl)formimidamide to provide 1&#8208;(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole which upon intermolecular coupling with 2&#8208;amino pyridines and a cascade sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&#8211;H amination provided a range of benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]benzimidazoles.
