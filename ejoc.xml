      <title>Formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol utilizing a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation reaction</title>
      <dc:description>In this study we report a convenient and high yielding formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol, a marine steroid with an intriguing sidechain containing a cyclopropane unit. This was achieved through the synthesis of an advanced ketone intermediate. The synthetic route features a total of ten steps, starting from commercially available stigmasterol, with an overall yield of 27%. The key step was a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation. This reaction proceeded in 82% yield, the resulting cyclopropane carboxylic ester shows a trans/cis ratio of 89:11, with a diastereomeric ratio for the trans&#8208;diastereomers of &gt;99:1. A reduction/oxidation sequence afforded the corresponding aldehyde, which was used in a Grignard reaction. A final oxidation step then yielded the desired ketone. This novel route presents a platform to further investigate the medicinal applications of gorgosterol&#8208;type steroids and to fully understand their role in coral symbiosis.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free Matsuda&#8208;Heck type cross&#8208;coupling and mechanistic evidence for a radical mechanism.</title>
      <dc:description>The Matsuda&#8208;Heck reaction, usually performed with palladium catalysts, can be carried out under transition metal free conditions in the presence of a KOtBu / DMF couple. This system allows, under mild conditions (20 &#176;C), the selective and direct synthesis of stilbenes from aryldiazonium salts. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway in which the DMF acts as the initiator of the overall process.</dc:description>

      <title>Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP) of cis&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;imine and thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;imine derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Cis  &#8208;  N  &#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ][1,3]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and cis&#8208;  N  &#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ][1,3]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines were prepared and subjected to Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP). NH&#8208; and NCH  3  &#8208; oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio&#8208; analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH  2  Ph&#8208; compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N&#8208;substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions (initiated by X3&#8208;C4, C8a&#8208;N1, or C2&#8208;X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470&#186;C. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N&#8208;substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones. Experimental results agree with calculations at the DFT level (B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G(d,p)) and M06&#8208;2X (6&#8208;311+G(d,p))&#160; from Gaussian09 software.</dc:description>

NH&#8208; and NCH  3  &#8208; oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio&#8208; analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH  2  Ph&#8208; compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N&#8208;substitution.

      <title>Updating the CSIC Reaction (2003&#8211;2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The mini review describes the progress and developments of the CSIC [Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling (or Intramolecular Cyclization)] reaction over the past 17&#8197;years, since 2003, when the first thematic review on the CSIC reaction was published.







Abstract
Herein, we have updated the progress and developments of the Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (or Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling, and Intramolecular Cyclization, abbreviated as CSIC reaction (CSICr), in the last seventeen years from the seminal review published in 2003 in this same Journal. CSICr has proven to be a useful and versatile synthetic tool, efficiently providing a number of open&#8208;chain [alkane(sulfonamide)sulfonates] or cylic (sultams and sultones) synthetic intermediates or final products of high value in organic and medicinal chemistry.

Abstract
C3&#8208;symmetrical, alkoxyphenyl substituted 2,5,8&#8208;(tris&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo [1,2&#8208;b; 3,4&#8208;b&#8242;; 5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophenes (OXD&#8208;BTT) are synthesized via threefold Huisgen&#8208;reaction. A broad variation of alkoxy substitution pattern and chain lengths is reported. The thermal behavior was investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and thermogravimetry (TGA). Optical properties were studied via UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Structural information of the LC phases was gained from X&#8208;ray diffraction on oriented fibers. OXD&#8208;BTT provide enormous phase widths (&#916;T&#8805;289&#8197;K) with clearing points close to thermal decomposition. Most of the derivatives exhibit two different mesophases, the lower phase with a rectangular 3D&#8208;structure and a hexagonal 2D&#8208;lattice at higher temperature. The variation of the chain length allows a tuning of melting and clearing points. OXD&#8208;BTT emit blue light with fluorescence quantum yields up to 30&#8201;% in good solvents. The emission is very sensitive to aggregation, thus, in poor solvents the emission intensity decreases, and red shift of maxima occurs.

      <title>Synthesis of&#160;&#947;&#8208;Spirolactams by Birch Reduction of Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>A convenient method for the synthesis&#160;of&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams in only three steps is described. Birch reduction of inexpensive and commercially available aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of chloroacetonitrile affords nitriles in moderate to good yields. Suitable precursors are methyl&#8208;substituted benzoic acids, naphthoic, and anthroic acid. Subsequent catalytic hydrogenation proceeds smoothly with PtO2&#160;or Raney Ni as catalysts and lactams are isolated in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Thus, up to 3 new stereogenic centers can be constructed as sole diastereomers from achiral benzoic acids. Furthermore, it is possible to control the degree of saturation at different pressures, affording products with 0, 1, or 2 double bonds. Overall, more&#160;than 15 new&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams&#160;have been synthesized in analytically pure form.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the structure of a cyclic epicatechin trimer produced by oxidative coupling. The trimer has a C3 symmetric structure shaped like three cats sleeping. Its stereostructure was assigned on the basis of various spectroscopic data, including theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. Epicatechin is a type of plant polyphenol and is present in various foods such as green tea, apples, grapes, and cocoa. During black tea production, various dimers and trimers of tea catechins, probably including the cyclic epicatechin trimer as well, are generated via enzymatic oxidation. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Matsuo, T. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows an illustration how N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines can be used as photoredox catalysts for the photoreduction of alkylated olefins and subsequent nucleophilic addition by alcohols. Compared to conventional photoredox catalyst, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and eosin Y, N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine have significantly more reducing power that is crucial for the photoinduced electron transfer to alkylated and thus non&#8208;activated olefins. This photoredox catalytic method tolerates many functional groups in the substrates. More information can be found in the Communication by Hans&#8208;Achim Wagenknecht et&#8197;al.

      <title>Allosteric Guest Binding in Chiral Zirconium(IV) Double Decker Porphyrin Cages</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a chiral double decker porphyrin cage, which has been resolved into enantiomers (red and blue structures). The compound was characterized by various physical techniques, including X&#8208;ray and circular dichroism (spectra in the center). The porphyrin cage compound forms well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers on HOPG surfaces, which are visible by scanning tunneling microscopy (background). The binding of a guest (viologen) in one of the cages of the compound leads to a contraction of the other cage (indicated by the white wiggles), resulting in a greatly reduced guest binding in the latter cage (negative allosteric effect). More information can be found in the Full Paper by Roeland J.M. Nolte et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>Enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols are prominent compounds that find numerous applications in organic chemistry. They are privileged building blocks for the synthesis of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), broadly used as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis, and efficient auxiliaries employed to control the stereochemical outcome of total synthesis. Among the number of strategies developed for the preparation of these molecules, enzyme mediated reactions have gained a crucial role in the toolbox of organic chemists for their high efficiency and sustainability. Herein we describe a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol designed by combining a thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent lyase and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase. The ThDP&#8208;dependent acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol oxidoreductase (Ao:DCPIP OR) is exploited to produce enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones through the benzoin&#8208;type condensation of methylacetoin with either aldehydes or activated ketones. The enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones undergo the selective reduction into the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diols in the same reaction mixture due to the addition of NAD  +  and of the NADH&#8208;dependent acetylacetoin reductase (AAR). Sodium formate was selected as the sacrificial reductive reactant to generate and recycle  in situ  the precious NADH by formate&#8208;dehydrogenase.

      <title>Synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and nucleic acid recognition of an acylhydrazone&#8208;conjugated cationic tetraphenylethene ligand</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are of interest in the pursuit of multivalent nucleic acids recognition. However, their formation often relies on non&#8208;covalent forces that are also at play in the interaction with nucleic acids. In this work, we designed a novel compound (  TPE&#8208;Gir  ) combining a tetraphenylethene aromatic core tethered to four quaternary ammoniums through acylhydrazone spacers, and we investigated in details its self&#8208;assembly and interaction with different types of nucleic acids. The spectroscopic analyses indicate the self&#8208;assembly of regular fluorescent nanoparticles (observed by DLS and TEM) in the absence of nucleic acids, the strong propensity to intercalate into single&#8208;stranded DNA, the ability to bind into the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA, and the selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by fitting within a wide G4&#8208;groove. Those recognition events are quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry and the proposed binding models are supported by docking simulations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the chemical community for over six decades. Among these intriguing secondary metabolites, there are members that are biosynthesized via oxidation(s) of the basic tetracyclic core of securinega natural products. These oxidation processes result in a sub&#8208;family of natural products with intriguing structural variations. We have grouped them as &#8220;high&#8208;oxidation state&#8221; securinega alkaloids. In this minireview, we, for the first time, categorize high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids into five groups based on their structural phenotype. We then describe all known syntheses of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids based on our classification. Plausible biosynthetic origins of securinega alkaloids in each group are described. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are depicted. The updated comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids provides us with an outlook on remaining key challenges related to these fascinating natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrostatic favors PNA stability over stereochemistry: Synthesis and biophysical studies of cationic dual&#8208;backbone PNA analogues</title>
      <dc:description>Modifications to the PNA backbone has been well known to alter the thermodynamical parameters of PNA:DNA complexes to broaden their utility for different applications.

In order to unlock the full potential of this class of molecules, an ability to control their secondary structures is essential.

Fluorination is shown to either reinforce or disrupt the 9&#8208;helical conformation depending on the C&#8211;F stereochemistry, and fluorination also sets the handedness of the helix.

&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives are raising increasing interest due to their robustness and their biological and chemical applications. This review takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of such derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols are pervasive structural scaffolds found in natural products and synthetic intermediates with varied biochemical and physicochemical properties. These profiles have driven numerous research groups to the synthesis of such motifs using innovative methodologies. The presence of vicinal diols attached to a cycloalkane makes from these motifs excellent synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of diverse ring systems. This investigation takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.

      <dc:description>Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained &#945;&#8208;helical peptides (&#945;&#8208;helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein&#8208;biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics have shown highest helicities in both single turn and extended, &#945;&#8208;helices (ST&#945;H, E&#945;H). Here we present a solution phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large scale, low cost synthesis of libraries of ST&#945;H and E&#945;H in high yields. The key to the efficiency is our trimodular (M  1  , M  2  , M  3  ) synthetic protocol where M  1  is a library of HBS&#8208;linked peptidomimetic synthons of both ST&#945;H and E&#945;H; M  2  and M  3  are desired oligopeptide libraries.

The most representative components are the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8208;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. Their biological activities have been known for a long time. In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports has witnessed a renewed interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents and lately in coordination polymers chemistry.

      <title>Use of Perylene Diimides in Synthetic Photochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Perylene diimides (PDIs) are valuable organic chromophores that stand out for their outstanding optical and redox properties. Owing to these features, PDIs have emerged as prominent dyes capable of acting as photocatalysts for numerous relevant organic transformations.

A divergent Hyp scission&#8208;reductive amination process was carried out, affording five linear peptides with cationic residues, and remarkably, a  N  &#8208;alkyl moiety that hindered rotation. After two steps (saponification and macrocyclization), sixteen differently  N1  &#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides were obtained. For the first time, the activity of the linear and cyclic compounds was compared.

      <title>"On&#8208;resin" disulfide peptide synthesis with methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate</title>
      <dc:description>New methodologies for the construction of full peptide structures with all disulfide bonds on the resin are attractive for the development of solid phase peptide synthesis. Detailed reaction conditions for the on&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation have been investigated using a mild and chemically stable oxidizing reagent, methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe). Monocyclic oxytocin, MCH and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI were synthesized in both semi&#8208;automated and full&#8208;automated protocols. It was found that on&#8208;resin intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Npys&#8208;OMe proceeds with the minimal formation of peptide oligomers by adopting a solvent system with 0.4 M LiCl/DMF. Crude peptides with complete disulfide bond patterns can be obtained in high purity in both protocols. This minimized the RP&#8208;HPLC purification step and the desired peptides were obtained with better yields. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated construction of a bicyclic disulfide peptide on resin with more than 50% purity in Fmoc&#8208;based SPPS. These results suggest that Npys&#8208;OMe is a useful reagent for the disulfide bond formation in automated protocols.</dc:description>

The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid.

New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.
