      <title>Front Cover: Regiodivergent Synthesis of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;Cannabinoquinones (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a crossroad, metaphorically representing the possibility of a phenol to be oxidized to an ortho&#8208; or a para&#8208;quinone depending on the nature of the oxidant (&#955;3&#8208; vs &#955;5&#8208;iodane). However, things are not so straightforward, since prototropic equilibria and valence tautomerization can provide a diversion from the selected pathway.

      <title>Front Cover: Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a conceptual illustration of molecular systems that can be activated by orthogonal stimuli to show multimodal movement. Integration of distinct mechanically active components would be a promising strategy to design molecular machines capable of executing sophisticated tasks. However, a key consideration is how to ensure selective operation of the individual components. In this regard, a variety of ingenious examples of molecular switches and motors powered by different stimuli to exhibit multiple dynamic features have been reported. More information can be found in the Minireview by S. Kwon et al.

      <title>Photoinduced decarboxylative radical addition reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of peptide substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Here, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Here, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Double Porphyrin Cage Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of double porphyrin cage compounds based on glycoluril is described. Through a multistep synthesis, three double cage compounds linked by spacers of variable length are obtained. The binding and conformational properties of their zinc derivatives towards the ditopic ligand dabco have been investigated into detail.






The synthesis and characterization of double porphyrin cage compounds are described. They consist of two porphyrins that are each attached to a diphenylglycoluril&#8208;based clip molecule via four ethyleneoxy spacers, and are linked together by a single alkyl chain using &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;chemistry. Following a newly developed multistep synthesis procedure we report three of these double porphyrin cages, linked by spacers of different lengths, i.e. 3, 5, and 11 carbon atoms. The structures of the double porphyrin cages were fully characterized by NMR, which revealed that they consist of mixtures of two diastereoisomers. Their zinc derivatives are capable of forming sandwich&#8208;like complexes with the ditopic ligand 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (dabco).

      <title>Mechanochemistry as a Sustainable Method for the Preparation of Fluorescent Ugi BODIPY Adducts</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, i. e., the use of mechanical energy produced by milling or grinding to perform chemical transformations, was used as a green strategy using a minimal amount of solvent for the preparation of highly valuable formyl functionalized BODIPY dyes. The stereoelectronic properties of the  meso  &#8208;aryl group plays a key role in the fluorescence response of the adducts resulting from the Ugi reaction. Such an understanding of the molecular structure&#8208;fluorescence interplay explains the brightness of these dyes in the cellular media monitored by fluorescence imaging. In the present report, we provide flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy evidence that the novel dyes stain efficiently peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and  Candida albicans  cells without disturbing cell integrity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by staining  C. albicans  cells, we can monitor the early and late steps of phagocytosis, using human monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages. The dye series presented herein represent a novel application for formyl functionalized BODIPY, expanding their applications in monitoring biological processes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this article we describe the synthesis of  &#947;  &#8208;lactones through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and disubstituted ketenes.&#160; The one&#8208;pot sequential method provides access to  &#947;  &#8208;lactones from disubstituted ketenes, in moderate to excellent yields, and with good diastereoselectivity favoring the  trans  &#8208;diastereomer (dr up to 92:8).&#160; The reaction mechanism was investigated by performing labeling, crossover and various control experiments.&#160; The results of those experiments support the reaction mechanism involving betaine formation, reaction of the betaine with a ketene to form an enolate intermediate, [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of an enolate intermediate, and finally 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;  tet  cyclization to afford the  &#947;  &#8208;lactone product.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this article we describe the synthesis of  &#947;  &#8208;lactones through the reaction of sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and disubstituted ketenes.&#160; The one&#8208;pot sequential method provides access to  &#947;  &#8208;lactones from disubstituted ketenes, in moderate to excellent yields, and with good diastereoselectivity favoring the  trans  &#8208;diastereomer (dr up to 92:8).&#160; The reaction mechanism was investigated by performing labeling, crossover and various control experiments.&#160; The results of those experiments support the reaction mechanism involving betaine formation, reaction of the betaine with a ketene to form an enolate intermediate, [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of an enolate intermediate, and finally 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;  tet  cyclization to afford the  &#947;  &#8208;lactone product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

      <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the rhodium(III) and iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amidation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with a range of nitrene surrogates including dioxazolones dioxazolones, organic azides, and N&#8208;methoxyamides through N&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation. Complete site&#8208;selectivity and functional group tolerance are observed. Notably, the large&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization highlight the synthetic potential of the developed protocol. This work is dedicated to Prof. Pierre H.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the rhodium(III) and iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amidation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolin&#8208;4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;ones with a range of nitrene surrogates including dioxazolones dioxazolones, organic azides, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methoxyamides through &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation. Complete site&#8208;selectivity and functional group tolerance are observed. Notably, the large&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization highlight the synthetic potential of the developed protocol. This work is dedicated to Prof. Pierre H. Dixneuf for his outstanding contribution to organometallic chemistry and catalysis. More information can be found in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.202001128"&gt;Full Paper by S.

      <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes that serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. It is demonstrated for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis. As the asymmetric environment around the reaction site is constructed by the trans&#8208;cyclooctene framework, the introduction of a substituent at the allylic position further improves enantioselectivity to 93% ee. These findings provide new chiral framework designs for the asymmetric ligands of metal catalysts. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Asano, S. Matsubara et al.

      <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

&lt;p&gt;This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.

The Cover Feature shows the iconic &#8220;Infinity Corridor&#8221; of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Metaphorically, it represents the ongoing efforts towards the synthesis of bacterial nonulosonic acids. The structurally complex nonulosonic acids are present at the termini of bacterial cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates and thereby play key roles in pathogen&#8208;host interactions. In this review, we have summarized the biosynthetic, enzymatic or chemical approaches to access three types of nonulosonic acids viz. Legionaminic acid (Leg), Acinetaminic acid (Aci), and Fusaminic acid (Fus) from diverse starting materials. More information can be found in the Minireview by K.&#160;Pradhan and S.&#160;S.

A novel synthetic methodology for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction is developed from propargyl alcohols and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls through the formation of tetra&#8208;substituted allenes as the key intermediates.






We have developed a novel synthetic methodology for the preparation of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction. In this reaction, tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols react with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to form tetra&#8208;substituted allenes, which are subsequently undergoing regiodivergent annulation with sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols to produce the fluorene&#8208;fused furan compounds. Broad substrate scope, regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and benzylic functionalization of products are some of the highlights of this protocol.

      <title>Metal and Solvent&#8208;Free, One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 3&#8208;Unsubstituted Benzoindolizines</title>
      <dc:description>A simple one&#8208;pot, solvent&#8208;free method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines is presented. Conversely to the output from standard classical cycloaddition approaches, an unconventional connectivity is achieved with excellent chemoselectivity under neat conditions without requiring any metal catalyst or additional additive. Hence, various abundant (iso)quinolines and propiolic esters were transformed into the corresponding benzoindolizines in synthetically useful yields. This straightforward and simplistic transformation expands the synthetic tool kit for the preparation of valuable 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines, which have been shown to be highly versatile synthetic intermediates with a broad bioactivity spectrum.</dc:description>

Conversely to the output from standard classical cycloaddition approaches, an unconventional connectivity is achieved with excellent chemoselectivity under neat conditions without requiring any metal catalyst or additional additive. Hence, various abundant (iso)quinolines and propiolic esters were transformed into the corresponding benzoindolizines in synthetically useful yields. This straightforward and simplistic transformation expands the synthetic tool kit for the preparation of valuable 3&#8208;unsubstituted indolizines, which have been shown to be highly versatile synthetic intermediates with a broad bioactivity spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A broad range of 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;thiopyrans were formed as products in much higher yields and productivities as compared to classical batch processes.

A light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity can be conferred to the material with the introduction of appropriate photosensitizers (PS). In this study, we have synthesized water&#8208;soluble silicon(IV)phthalocyanine derivative (SiPc) that contains four carboxylic groups on the periphery of the macrocycle.

Although UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopic methods showed that both, free and conjugated PS, are non&#8208;aggregated in water media, only SiPcCh possess remarkable antibacterial effect against Gram&#8208;positive  B. subtilis  and Gram&#8208;negative  E.coli  .</dc:description>

Testing of catalytic activity in propargyl cyclopropanation demonstrated that the new  N,N,O  &#8208;ligated gold(III) complex was highly catalytic active and outperformed AuCl  3  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
