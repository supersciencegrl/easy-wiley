         <title>Decarboxylative Mannich Reactions with N&#8208;Alkyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative Mannich reactions with substituted malonic acids half oxyesters as pronucleophiles has been applied to N&#8208;alkyl imines. Key to success was the use of an organocatalyst in combination with acid additives to favor the desired pathway. These conditions were also found to be compatible with the in&#8197;situ generation of the imine, leading to an original multicomponent reaction.







Abstract
The use of N&#8208;alkyl imines in decarboxylative Mannich reaction with substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) has been developed to afford a direct access to secondary &#946;2,3&#8208;aminoesters. The transformation occurs under very practical conditions (DABCO as a catalyst in bulk toluene and open to air) and can be performed with a broad range of each substrate in yields of 36 to 97&#8201;%. Importantly, the reaction was found to require the use of acidic additives in combination with the organocatalyst to limit the competitive olefination reaction.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Linearly Fused Triquinanes through Tandem&#8208;Metathesis: Access to Basic Core of Cucumin, Capnellene, Chondrosterin, and Xeromphalinone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;metathesis approach to linearly fused tricyclic enone 1 and cis&#8208;anti&#8208;cis&#8208;type hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2 has been described in an efficient manner starting with exo&#8208;dicyclopentadiene&#8208;1&#8208;one. The tricyclic enone 1 was found to be a core unit of triquinane&#8208;based natural products such as cucumin, capnellene, chondrosterin, and xeromphalinone.







Abstract
Herein, a short synthetic approach to linearly fused tricyclic enone 1 and cis&#8208;anti&#8208;cis type hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2 has been described in an efficient manner by employing tandem&#8208;metathesis as a key step. The triquinane&#8208;based enone 1 is prepared by a Babler&#8211;Dauben oxidation of hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2, which is assembled by following a three&#8208;step sequence involving a regio&#8208; and stereoselective allylation, vinyl Grignard addition, and tandem&#8208;metathesis. Our strategy relies on exo&#8208;tricyclic ketone, which is derived from readily available exo&#8208;dicyclopentadiene&#8208;1&#8208;one. The newly synthesized molecules were identified and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. It is worth mentioning that tricyclic enone 1 is present as a core unit of many naturally occurring polyquinanes, particularly xeromphalinone family members. Hence, our approach may be useful in the synthesis of such bioactive molecules.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Chain&#8208;Deuterated Sphingosine and Its Derivatization to Produce Ceramide, Sphinganine and Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;Phosphate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingosine plays crucial roles in various cellular functions. Deuterated molecules are widely used as the important tools to explore the structure, property, and function of biochemical materials. We here report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of sphingosines with different deuterated chains. The synthesis started from different protiated fatty acids, which underwent hydrothermal platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange to produce the deuterated chains with different length. The Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) coupling of a chiral amino acid derivative with the deuterated chains generated the unsaturated ketone precursors. The following stereoselective reduction via cyclic Felkin&#8208;Anh transition led to the desired anti&#8208;amino alcohol geometry. This efficient protocol enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated sphingosines. The subsequent synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated derivatives, i.e. ceramide, sphinganine and sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, is also described. Their deuterium content was simultaneously characterised by 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum (HRMS).</dc:description>

         <title>Lithiation and Alkylation of the Imidazole Backbone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise improved method for the alkylation of the imidazole backbone has been developed. The positions 1 and 2 of the imidazole ring were protected with tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;yl and chloro groups, respectively. Position 5 of imidazole was then lithiated, whereupon alkylation could be conducted by means of a variety of electrophilic reagents including haloalkanes, aldehydes, and ketones. Finally, the two protective / auxiliary groups on the positions 1 and 2 were easily removed by means of treatment with acid and base and hydrogenation, respectively. The developed method proved good functional group tolerance but demanded non&#8208;bulky molecular moieties in the vicinity of the attaching C&#8208;atom of the reagent. The novel alkylating method was used to synthesize two new NHC&#8208;Ag complexes holding branched alkyl groups on the imidazole backbone.</dc:description>

Iron&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylation of indole&#8208;tethered alkene with Togni's reagent to construct CF3&#8208;containing spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] and tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives under mild and convenient conditions has been disclosed.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylation of indole&#8208;tethered alkene with Togni's reagent to construct CF3&#8208;containing spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] and tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives under mild and convenient conditions has been disclosed. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceed through a CF3 radical addition to the alkene, followed by sequential dearomatizing spiocyclization of the indole and oxidation to afford the spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] derivatives. Meanwhile, when the substituent at the C2 position of the indole is hydrogen, the CF3&#8208;containing tetrahydrocarbazole is obtained through trifluoromethylation of alkene and cyclization of indole.

         <title>Photoinduced Glycosylation Using a Diarylthiophene as an Organo Lewis Photoacid Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced glycosylation of trichloroacetimidate donors and several alcohols using 3,11&#8208;dimethoxydinaphthothiophene as an organo Lewis photoacid catalyst upon long&#8208;wavelength UV&#8208;LED light (385 nm) irradiation under mild reaction conditions proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding glycosides in good to high yields. In addition, the present glycosylation method was applicable to a wide range of trichloroacetimidate donors and acceptors. Furthermore, the dinaphthothiophene catalyst could be recovered and reused without any loss of efficiency. Moreover, this glycosylation method was applied successfully to the total synthesis of a biologically active natural product, cholesteryl 6&#8208;O&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucoside.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay for Synthesis of Fluorescent Naphthoquinolizinium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H bond activation relay starting from 1&#8208;azabiphenylene via intermediate benzo[h]quinolines allows short syntheses of various 5,6,10,11&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. The salts exhibit strong fluorescence (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) ranging from 420&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded polyaromatic hydrocarbons with a planar geometry. The synthetic pathway is based on catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H bond activation relay that enabled preparation of regioselectively 5,6,10,11&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of selected compounds confirmed planarity of the quinolizinium core. Most of the prepared compounds exhibited strong fluorescence (&#934;s up to &gt;99&#8201;%) ranging from 420&#8211;600&#8197;nm depending on the substitution pattern. According to DFT calculations LUMO is always distributed over the quinolizinium framework regardless of the attached substituents, whereas delocalization of HOMO is related to the substitution pattern. Electrochemical measurements show irreversible reduction of all compounds, which is supported by the calculated location of LUMO orbitals.

         <title>Thermolysis of Geminal Diazido Malonamides: Simple Access to Tetrazoles and Functionalization of In Situ Formed Isocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazole or urea compound: The thermolytical decomposition under microwave irradiation of diazidated malonamides was studied. A variety of different tetrazoles could be synthesized in three steps starting from diethyl malonate. Furthermore, the formation of isocyanates in&#8197;situ was investigated.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of synthetic methods to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles has become increasingly popular. Among these, tetrazoles &#8211; an important class of aromatic heterocycles &#8211; are of significant interest for example, in medicinal chemistry serving as important bioisosteres. Herein, we present a method to easily access C&#8208;substituted tetrazoles via thermolysis of geminal diazido malonamides. Formation and functionalization of in&#8197;situ formed isocyanates and corresponding reactions were also studied.

         <title>Metal&#8208; and Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;Phthalimides Using 2&#8208;(Arenesulfonyl)Phthalimide as Key Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenesulfonyl phthalimides and arensulfonyl succinimides are easily prepared in very good yield from the reaction of arenesulfonyl chlorides with phthalimide and succinimide. Arenesulfonyl phthalimides react with aromatic and aliphatic amines to yield the corresponding N&#8208;substituted phthalimide derivatives. Arenesulfonyl phthalimides proved to be excellent phthalimidation reagents. Arenesulfonyl succinimide undergoes ring opening upon reaction with aromatic and aliphatic amines.







Abstract
Phthalimide derivatives are important in medicinal chemistry, several phthalimidation methodologies have been developed. Here, we report a facile, metal&#8208;free, and catalyst&#8208;free method for the preparation of N&#8208;phthalimides in good to excellent yield by reacting 2&#8208;(arenesulfonyl)phthalimides with various amine substrates.

         <title>Sydnone Methides: Intermediates between Mesoionic Compounds and Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

Sydnone methides can be deprotonated to form anionic NHCs which were converted into selenoethers and phosphanyl derivatives.







Abstract
Sydnone methides represent an almost unknown class of mesoionic compounds which possess exocyclic carbon substituents instead of oxygen (sydnones) or nitrogen (sydnone imines) in the 5&#8208;position of a 1,2,3&#8208;oxadiazolium ring. Unsubstituted 4&#8208;positions give rise to the generation of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes by deprotonation. Preparations of new sydnone methides are described here. They can be represented by mesomeric structures with either exocyclic carbanionic groups like &#8722;C(CN)2&#8722;, &#8722;C(CN)(COOMe)&#8722;, &#8722;C(CN)(CONH2)&#8722;, and &#8722;C(CN)(SO2Me)&#8722;, or with the corresponding exocyclic C=C double bonds as a common feature with mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. An X&#8208;ray single structure analysis revealed a length of 140.7(3)&#8197;pm of the exocyclic bond in the solid state. From the coalescence temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C) determined by a series of 13C&#8197;NMR experiments (150&#8197;MHz) at various temperatures, an energy of rotation of 18.5&#8197;Kcal/mol was calculated for this bond. The 13C&#8197;NMR signals of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, from which the 2&#8208;mesityl&#8208;substituted anionic NHC proved to be stable up to 10&#8201;&#176;C, are highly shifted upfield (&#948;carbene=157.9&#8197;ppm&#8722;160.5&#8197;ppm). The carbenes can be reacted in&#8197;situ with elemental selenium and chlorophosphanes to yield sydnone methide selenoethers after methylation and 4&#8208;phosphanylsydnone methides in good to excellent yields, respectively.

         <title>Convenient Approach to 10&#8208; and 11&#8208;Membered Azalactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed new methods for the synthesis of functionalized 10&#8208; and 11&#8208;membered azalactams by reductive cleavage of bicyclic dihydropyrimidones as well as their quaternary salts. The azalactams were used as starting materials for further synthesis of annulated imidazole and tetrazole derivatives.







Abstract
A convenient method for the synthesis of 10&#8208; and 11&#8208;membered azalactams via reductive cleavage of bicyclic systems featuring an amidine fragment was studied. It was found that the ring&#8208;expansion reaction of bicyclic dihydropyrimidones depends on the ring size of saturated fragment, substituents in the pyrimidone core and reaction conditions. A new efficient method for the synthesis of medium ring azalactams by reductive cleavage of quaternary salts of annulated dihydropyrimidones was proposed as well. The obtained medium ring azalactams with a secondary amine function were used in the synthesis of bicyclic heteroaromatic systems.

         <title>C2&#8208;Cyanomethyl (CNMe) Ether&#8208;Protected Glycosyl Trichloroacetimidate Donors for Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanomethyl (CNMe) ether group has been reported as a stereodirecting C2&#8208;protecting group on glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors. The synthesized donors were activated by TMSOTf catalyst to obtain the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides in excellent stereoselectivities. The stereoselectivity was achieved in the presence of both arming and disarming protections on the donor as well as the acceptor handles. The donors have been extended in the synthesis of saccharides bearing consecutive &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;linkages.







Abstract
Stereoselective construction of glycosidic linkages have emerged as one of the pivotal aspects for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharide assemblies. We herein report C2&#8208;cyanomethyl (CNMe) ether as a strong stereodirecting group on trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides. The developed donors bearing various arming and disarming protections along with C2&#8208;CNMe ether delivered the glycosides in short reaction time, moderate to good yields and high to excellent stereoselectivities. Gluco&#8208; and galacto&#8208; configured donors were found compatible with an array of alcohols having varied reactivities. The orthogonality of the CNMe ether protection with silyl ether group has been further explored for sequential glycosylations.

         <title>KI&#8208;Mediated Chlorine Gas&#8208;Free Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient KI&#8208;mediated chloro&#8208;oxidation of indoles was developed, using KCl/NaCl as the chlorine source and oxone as oxidant, which affording various functionalized 3,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles in moderate to excellent yields. This chlorine gas&#8208;free protocol provided a practical approach for the synthesis of a series of 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole derivatives.







Abstract

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapyrrole shape and distribution of polar substituents have been established as important design considerations for novel photosensitizers. Such parameters were successfully incorporated into the design of novel porphyrins with isomer specific cell internalization. Restrictive strapped moieties were used to enforce the &#945;4 picket fence porphyrin motif with high stability to modulate cell uptake.







Abstract
The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity is highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable cis&#8208;&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;4 configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Curcumins with 3&#8208;Olefinic Oxindoles for the Synthesis of Spirocyclohexanoneoxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;oxindoles containing three contiguous chiral centers were synthesized with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities via cascade double Michael reactions of curcumins with 3&#8208;alkylideneoxindole carboxylates. The selectivities are supported by transitions state energy calculations at B3LYP//6&#8208;31g(d) level of DFT.







Abstract
An enantioselective desymmetrization of curcumins with 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles involving a cascade double&#8208;Michael addition strategy provides direct access to spirocyclohexanone&#8208;oxindoles with complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities, besides good to excellent yields. The products possess three contiguous chiral centers and multiple reactive functionalities. The observed selectivities were rationalized by transitions state energy calculations at B3LYP//6&#8208;31g(d) level of DFT.

         <title>Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;Dioxaborinine Hybrid Dyes: Synthesis and Substituent Effect in the Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>

A novel family of hybrid fluorophores based on the pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;dioxaborinine (PP&#8208;DB) system is provided by constructing the dioxaborinine moiety on the fused ring in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
A novel family of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine&#8208;dioxaborinine (PP&#8208;DB) hybrid dyes was synthesized by the direct construction of the dioxaborinine (DB) fragment on the pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine (PP) ring, which implies the formation of four new bonds in a one&#8208;pot manner. The dyes&#8217; optical properties were investigated and compared with the starting pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines; a study evidencing large fluorescence quantum yields in products (&#966;f up to 69&#8201;%) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process from the PP core to a ring of DB (PP&#8594;DB) that is absent in precursors (&#966;f=0.03&#8211;0.30). Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations confirmed the fluorescence process involved in the novel dyes, where their ICT limits the non&#8208;radiative process due to the restricted rotation in the D&#8722;A system. The present work provides insight into how phenyl and DB ring incorporation impact the optical properties of this new group of hybrids dyes based on PP&#8208;DB.

The present work provides insight into how phenyl and DB ring incorporation impact the optical properties of this new group of hybrids dyes based on PP-DB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced C3&#8208;trifluoroethylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using an inexpensive organic dye as a photocatalyst and commercially available 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodoethane as a trifluoroethyl radical source. This reaction has a wide range of applicability and mild reaction conditions, which provide a straightforward route in preparation of C3&#8208;trifluoroethylated quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Rose bengal catalyzed C3&#8208;trifluoroethylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones is reported. A wide range of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones was compatible, which led to the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. A gram&#8208;scale reaction proceeded well and afforded an efficient route to prepare C3&#8208;trifluoroethylated quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven protocol to access alkyl boronic acid pinacol esters from vinyl boronate using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters as the alkyl generator was developed. A good substrate scope was examined, demonstrating good to high yields and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A novel and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute light&#8208;driven protocol for the preparation of alkyl boronic acid pinacol esters from vinyl boronate using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters as the potential precursor is described. In this photochemical protocol, the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester's fragmentation generates C&#8208;centered radicals, which undergo a radical Michael addition to vinyl boronic pinacol ester furnishing the desired products. A good substrate scope having various functionalities is presented and good to high yields are obtained.

PIDA/I2&#8208;mediated decarboxylative C4&#8208;amination of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids was achieved via direct Csp2&#8722;H dehydrogenative C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with secondary amines under ambient conditions.







Abstract
An efficient and straightforward protocol for accessing a new series of functionalized 4&#8208;aminocoumarins from PIDA/I2&#8208;mediated decarboxylative C4&#8208;amination of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids via direct Csp2&#8722;H dehydrogenative C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with secondary amines under ambient conditions has been accomplished. The notable advantages of this protocol are the tolerance of diverse functional groups, mild reaction conditions at ambient temperature, moderate to good yields, short reaction times (in minutes), high regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. This is the first report of decarboxylative Csp2&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;N coupling of coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids for synthesizing 4&#8208;aminocoumarins.

         <title>Front Cover: Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 15/2023)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates how molecular shape can control drug uptake. Using strapped porphyrins as models for atropisomeric drugs, the artwork shows that molecules with polar groups on one side of the macrocycle can cross the cell membrane while those with other orientations do not. Cover design by Ella Marushchenko. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. C. Gomes&#8208;da&#8208;Silva, M. O. Senge et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines, having diverse reactivity profile, have been exploited as versatile reaction partners in synthetic organic chemistry. This review comprehensively highlights the advancement made in asymmetric catalysis employing various chemically and structurally distinct conjugated imines/azadienes.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds have consistently been a noticeable center of attention due to their significant utilization in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated imines or conjugated imines provide a lot of significant cyclic as well as acyclic products through reacting with a versatile family of compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in enantioselective reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines by using synthetic methodologies for synthesizing various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that contain four to six&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of rarely found seven&#8208;, eight&#8208; and nine&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles have also been reported.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Compounds for the Synthesis of Amines: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 15, April 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In synthetic chemistry and pharmacy, the reductive amination reaction is crucial because it is one of the most effective methods for forming C&#8722;N bonds. Reductive amination is a reaction that occurs when an amine or ammonia is combined with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of a reducing agent and a catalyst. For these reactions to access different amines, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been successfully developed. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Reductive amination is a valuable method for amine synthesis that has been the topic of a century&#8216;s worth of in&#8208;depth study in both academia and industry. Amines and their derivatives serve as incredibly adaptable building blocks for a broad array of organic substrates and are significant precursors for a myriad of advanced chemicals, physiologically active compounds, agrochemicals, biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. The creation of innovative catalytic processes for the long&#8208;term and selective synthesis of amines from readily accessible and environmentally benign reagents remains a top priority in chemical research. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been designed with success to enable these reactions to explore new amines. Ruthenium catalysts are employed in reductive amination owing to their stability, selectivity, versatility, low toxicity, and high efficiency. This review comprehensively overviews the Ru&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination processes and includes the literature from 2009 to 2022.

         <title>Yb(OTf)3 Anchored on Crosslinked Chitosan Microsphere: A Green Heterogenized Catalyst for the Synthesis of Bispiro&#8208;Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using renewable biomass chitosan as a raw material, crosslinked chitosan microsphere (CCM) was prepared by inverse suspension, which was then immersed in the ethanol solution of Yb(OTf)3 to fabricate CCM&#8208;supported Yb(OTf)3 (Yb(OTf)3@CCM). The three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition of isatins, tetrahydroisoquinolines and 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines was developed with Yb(OTf)3@CCM as a green heterogeneous catalyst, which gave access to a suite of architecturally complex bispiro&#8208;fused heterocycles merging four pharmacophores with moderate to excellent yields (50&#8208;96%) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr). The reaction mechanism was preliminarily clarified by the controlled experiments and dynamic high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies. The synthetic potential of this protocol was proved by a gram&#8208;scale reaction which furnished the product with comparable results (85% yield and 72:28 dr). Moreover, the catalyst could be recovered just through filtering, washing and drying process, and reused for five times with the catalytic activity remaining in an acceptable range (from 93% to 73% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Exploitation of Dimeric Cyclic Cysteine as Helix Inducer in Ultra&#8208;Short Peptides for Cu(II)&#8208;Catalysed Asymmetric Michael Addition on Chalcones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimeric cyclic cysteine analogue, i. e. (1R,1'R,2R,2'R)&#8208;2,2'&#8208;disulfanediylbis (aminocyclohexane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid), was used as a constrained unnatural amino acid and as a folding inducer in ultra&#8208;short Leu&#8208;Val&#8208;containing peptide. Our results showed that both free dimer amino acid L1 and its peptide derivative L2 are able to chelate Cu(II). The obtained complexes resulted to be catalytically active in Michael addition reaction of nitromethane on different types of chalcones. L1&#8208;Cu(II) was shown more reactive in terms of conversion, while, in neat conditions, L2&#8208;Cu(II) allows to obtain an interesting 60% e.e. on pyridine chalcone.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Lactonization of Alkenes with Acyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalytic acyl lactonization of unsaturated carboxylic acids using simple and inexpensive acyl chlorides has been developed for a modular synthesis of acyl lactones. Significantly, the simple protocol could allow an efficient construction of biologically important phthalide framework. The transformation could be extended to a wide variety of unsaturated carboxylic acids, including substituted 2&#8208;vinyl benzoic acids and different types of alkenoic acids. Moreover, a series of aroyl, heteroaroyl chlorides could serve as coupling partners. Notably, functional groups including MeO, F, Cl and Br could survive. It is believed that acyl radicals generated from acyl chlorides under photoredox catalysis reacted with alkenes via atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) and triggered subsequent lactonization in the process. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the transformation probably proceed through a free radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Perspective on the Mechanochemical Method to Reduce Carbonyl Groups with Stainless Steel and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry via high&#8208;speed ball milling has become an increasingly popular method for performing organic transformations. This newfound interest in high&#8208;speed ball milling is in part driven by the benefit of performing reactions in the absence of solvent. Mechanochemical reactions are often conducted in stainless&#8208;steel vials with stainless&#8208;steel balls. Since stainless steel is made of several readily oxidizable metals (Fe, Cr, and Ni), reduction reactions using water as a hydrogen source were explored using a temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) pathway, with iron and nickel being essential components for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total syntheses of two sesquiterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;HM&#8208;3 and (&#8722;)&#8208;HM&#8208;4, were accomplished using a gold&#8208;catalyzed [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium as key step. This stereospecific transformation allowed the access to these two natural products in only 7&#8211;8 chemical steps.







Abstract
The asymmetric total synthesis of two sesquiterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;HM&#8208;3 and (&#8722;)&#8208;HM&#8208;4, isolated from a phytopathogenic fungus, has been developed using a gold&#8208;catalyzed [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium as key step. During this transformation, an excellent chirality transfer was observed between the chiral sulfoxide substrate and the newly formed quaternary stereogenic center with 96&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. The implementation of this efficient methodology allowed us to isolate the two natural products in only 7&#8211;8 chemical steps with overall yields reaching 12&#8211;16&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis of Diastereomeric 8&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;ABC&#8208;Steroid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diastereomeric ABC&#8208;building blocks for hitherto widely unknown steroids with a fluorine substituent in 8&#8208;position were prepared in a convergent synthesis with eight linear steps from 6&#8208;chlorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene and a benzocyclobutene derivative. Key step was an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of an o&#8208;quinodimethane with a fluorine&#8208;containing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone.







Abstract
An eight&#8208;step linear sequence for the preparation of two diastereomers of an 8&#8208;fluoro&#8208;ABC&#8208;steroid building block was developed. Key step was an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of an intermediate o&#8208;quinodimethane formed from a benzocyclobutene substituted with a 5&#8208;fluorohex&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;one chain. This side chain was prepared from 6&#8208;chlorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene by bromofluorination, elimination of HBr, Finkelstein reaction and alkylation of a literature&#8208;known benzocyclobutene derivative with the thus&#8208;formed 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene. Allylic oxidation of side chain's fluorovinyl moiety to an &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone completed the preparation of the precursor for the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition.

Abstract
A new class of polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalysts with a triazole linker from diphenyl prolinol were developed. Their catalytic activity was tested in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes. The substrate scope of this catalysis was studied under the optimized reaction conditions. The reusability of the polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalyst was demonstrated up to four cycles. Based on the reaction results, a reaction mechanism was proposed for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes.

         <title>The Oxidation of Organo&#8208;Boron Compounds Using Electrochemically Generated Peroxodicarbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deborolative hydroxylation of arenes and alkenes using the green and largely under&#8208;explored oxidizer peroxodicarbonate is reported. Accessible through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis of aqueous carbonate solutions at low temperature and high current density, highly concentrated solutions of this green and sustainable oxidizer lead to a simple and straightforward protocol using only green solvents and allowed for scale&#8208;up reactions to multi&#8208;gram batch sizes.







Abstract
Peroxodicarbonate represents a green and largely underexplored oxidizer generated electrochemically from aqueous carbonate solutions. Through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzer technology, highly concentrated solutions have now become accessible. These were successfully employed as green oxidizer in deborolative hydroxylations. A plethora of phenols and alcohols have thus been synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% from organoboron compounds using only green and non&#8208;toxic solvents. This transformation was successfully scaled&#8208;up to multi&#8208;gram batch sizes.

         <title>Economical and Environmentally Friendly Organic hydrazone Derivatives Characterized by a Heteroaromatic Core as Potential Hole Transporting Materials in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of organic electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;bridged symmetric hydrazones, composed of two donor moieties connected through a thiophene&#8208; or a pyrrole&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;spacer, has been synthesized as a suitable alternative to 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis[N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino]&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), considered the benchmark hole transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The cheap synthetic protocol is suitable for potential large&#8208;scale production. All the compounds were characterized, showing good energy levels alignments with the perovskite and very close energy levels to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed the electrochemical trend observed. The costs of synthesis were estimated, as well as the produced waste to synthesise the final HTMs, underlining the low impact of these compounds on the environment with the respect to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize alternative to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for industrial development of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Electric Field Induced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electric field is currently being used more directly for chemical reactions. Experiments showed that the existence of electric fields in non&#8208;redox processes may alter the catalytic activity, rate enhancement, and selection. It is anticipated that this interaction between electric fields and chemical reactions will create new avenues for producing materials with desired properties in a number of chemical disciplines, including synthetic organic chemistry, catalysis, nanotechnology, membrane technology, and enzyme catalysis. Specifically, in this review we discussed the elegant experimental investigations carried out using the scanning tunneling microscope, interfacial electric fields and designed local electric fields. The results of these studies have been remarkable, leading to new information on the function of electric fields in controlling chemical reactivity and selectivity in different reactions, offering a glimpse of the great potential of electrostatic fields. This cutting&#8208;edge scientific advancement not only presents the core concepts of the field&#8208;induced chemical transformations but also encourages the creation of new modern techniques in chemistry and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Synthesis, Conformational Study, and Aroma Properties of Carba&#8208;Homologues of Helvetolide and Serenolide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have designed, prepared, and evaluated a set of racemic (un)saturated carba&#8208;homologues of prominent musks Helvetolide and Serenolide. The short synthesis employs commercially available Artemone and/or Herbac that are transformed in three steps to target compounds. Their qualitative olfactory analysis revealed that incorporation of methylene bridge into the backbone chain of parent compounds completely erases the original musk scent and such new derivatives exhibit a pleasant and often intense sweet(ish) aroma of fruit with floral and herbal aspects. The results of computational modelling suggest that previously postulated horseshoe shape conformation might be necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for musk&#8208;scenting compounds. Thus, we offer an alternative hypothesis based on the structural differences between metallocomplexes of Helvetolide and/or Serenolide vs. their (un)saturated carba&#8208;homologues with zinc&#8208;atom as a model for the putative metal&#8208;binding site in human olfactory receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Carboxylic Acids: The Trend of Radical Decarboxylative Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exceptional versatility of carboxylic acids has been extensively exploited in organic synthesis across several decades. There has been a recent upsurge of radical decarboxylative transformations. The process can be initiated under mild conditions, and the resultant radicals have orthogonal reactivities to closed&#8208;shell species, thus providing immense opportunities for streamlining novel reactions. The use of free carboxylic acids is the most desirable owing to its high atom and step economy. Aiming to demonstrate the attractiveness of the strategy and to inspire chemists to tackle existing challenges, this review outlines the recent advances on radical decarboxylative functionalization of free carboxylic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Pyridine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Molecules: Recent Strategies and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover Cover illustrates how the pyridine ring of the antihistamine loratadine can be selectively functionalised at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, or para&#8208;position (each of them activated by a thunder). Indeed, the selective functionalisation of this N&#8208;heterocycle is often problematic, thus a lighthouse guides the chemists through the late&#8208;stage functionalisations of pyridine&#8208;containing biomolecules. More information can be found in the Review by V. Fasano et&#8197;al.

         <title>Total Synthesis of a Pentasaccharide O&#8208;Glycan from Acinetobacter baumannii</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a scorpion amongst a colony of A. baumannii bacteria. We can see that the bacteria bear our target pentasaccharide (depicted here using &#8220;sugar code&#8221; notation) and that one of these pentasaccharides adorns the scorpion&#8242;s stinger. We see this as an apt symbol for the role that the pentasaccharide plays in virulence during A. baumannii infection. Nevertheless, we see the shadow of the stinger looming ominously over the scorpion and the legion of A. baumannii. Might that which ensures the virulence of A. baumannii also be its undoing? Cover designed by Brandon Conrad. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. K. Njeri and J. R. Ragains.

         <title>Synthesis of Aryl and Alkyl&#8208;Containing 3&#8208;Methylene&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy Esters via a Barbier Allylation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of C&#8208;C bonds via the allylation of carbonyl compounds has been widely applied in total syntheses. Amongst the many possible strategies, the Barbier&#8208;type allylation in aqueous media has received only moderate attention over the last decades despite its mild reaction conditions. In this study, we investigated the indium (In0) and zinc (Zn0) mediated Barbier allylation reaction to efficiently synthesize base&#8208;labile 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy containing building blocks for natural product total synthesis. As model study we selected the allylation of lipidic undecanal with ethyl 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)but&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the presence of either Zn0 or In0 and investigated the effects of additives on yields and selectivities. We then applied the optimized reaction conditions to sterically demanding allyl bromides and functionalized aromatic aldehydes yielding eleven new homoallylic alcohols, one of which was further transformed via oxidation and reduction sequences.</dc:description>

A stereoselective one&#8208;pot double derivatization of cyclobutene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid via a mild organic base catalyzed amidation/aza&#8208;Michael addition of benzo[d]oxazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones has been developed.







Abstract
A stereoselective one&#8208;pot double derivatization of cyclobutene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid via a mild organic base catalyzed amidation/aza&#8208;Michael addition of benzo[d]oxazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones has been developed. This unprecedented tandem reaction provides access to novel &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclobutane carboximide derivatives with a trans geometry. The carboximide moiety reacts smoothly with nucleophiles, allowing access to diverse derivatives of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclobutanecarboxylic acid, including peptidomimetic structures.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent 2&#8208;Aminopurine Derivatives: Synthesis, Photo&#8208;physical Characterization, and Preliminary Cytotoxicity Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly fluorescent 2&#8208;aminopurine (2AP) derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines, were obtained using a new and simple synthesis method. All the new compounds exhibit advantageous photophysical properties over 2AP, emitting in the blue/cyan spectral region, and little or no toxicity in assays using yeast cells. These compounds are valuable candidates for fluorescence studies in biological systems.







Abstract
New fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) are emerging as extraordinarily useful tools for DNA labelling technologies. The highly fluorescent adenine analogue 2&#8208;aminopurine (2AP) is still the most used within the few hundreds of newly FBAs synthesized, but its excitation in the UV region demands for high energy sources endangering living cells. New and highly fluorescent 2AP derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines, were obtained using simpler but efficient synthesis method. All the new compounds exhibit advantageous photophysical properties over 2AP, showing absorption and emission bands ranging the visible region (blue&#8208;green region), high fluorescence quantum yields and Stokes&#8217; shifts, especially in non&#8208;protic organic solvents. Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT) of electronic and vibrational structure were performed, allowing to predict absorption and emission spectra. In addition, these 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;cyanopurines exhibit little to no toxicity in assays using yeast cells.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Exocyclic Cyclitol Aziridines as Potential Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inactivators</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight exocyclic aziridine cyclitols were synthesized, envisioned as putative covalent inhibitors of inverting glucosidases. The constructs, bearing a range of electron withdrawing moieties, were obtained efficiently through an aza&#8208;Michael initiated ring closure reaction (aza&#8208;MIRC) on validamine or 1&#8208;epi&#8208;validamine. The synthetic methodologies and inhibitor design presented here can fuel the future discovery of covalent inhibitors of inverting glycosidases.







Abstract
Cyclophellitol aziridines have found wide application as mechanism&#8208;based, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of retaining glycosidases. These compounds, like their parent compound, cyclophellitol (a natural product retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inactivator), make use of the mechanism of action of retaining glycosidases, which process their substrate through the formation of a transient covalent intermediate. In contrast, inverting glycosidases, the other main family of glycosyl hydrolases, do not employ such a covalent intermediate, and, as a consequence, useful scaffolds for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design have yet to be discovered. In this work, we explore chemistries that allow for the construction of cyclitol aziridines with the aziridine electrophile attached in an exocyclic fashion, more distal from the anomeric carbon &#8211; thus putatively closer to an inverting glycosidase active site nucleophile. The developed chemistries have allowed for the synthesis of a focused library of differently N&#8208;substituted, &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;glucopyranose configured cyclitol aziridines for future evaluation as inhibitors or inactivators of &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;glucosidases alike.

         <title>New Trends in Asymmetric Phase Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase Transfer Catalysis (PTC) is a powerful tool to perform reactions in a practical fashion, both in laboratory and industrial scale. Significant cost savings and major process improvements can be achieved in reactions performed under PTC conditions. In the last few years remarkable results in stereoselective reactions were achieved using chiral, non&#8208;racemic quaternary ammonium salts. Moreover, the use of bulky, chiral phosphate anions paired with achiral cations to generate lipophilic ion pairs allowed to design new avenues for the stereoselective construction of important building blocks. Hydrogen bond interactions were also shown to to provide new pathways for asymmetric nucleophilic substitutions using insoluble reagents under PTC conditions. This review will focus on recent advances in developing practical synthetic routes to construct molecules in a stereoselective fashion under PTC conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8211;C/C&#8211;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the unique properties of C&#8211;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8211;C and a C&#8211;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic Deep Eutectic Solvents as Active Media for Sustainable Synthesis of Biindoles Starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Diaminotolanes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of an &#8220;active&#8221; acidic Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) as solvent/catalyst together with dielectric heating promote a more sustainable preparation of biindoles through a tricky cascade cyclization process starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diaminotolanes and (hetero)arylaldehydes.







Abstract
We describe an alternative and more sustainable method for the synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3,3&#8217;&#8208;biindoles starting from 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diaminotolanes and (hetero)arylaldehydes. The key feature of the approach is the use of an acidic Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) able to exploit a double activity, i.&#8201;e., solvent and Br&#248;nsted Acid (BA) catalyst, avoiding the use of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) as solvents and additional acid catalysts. By this way, we synthesized twenty&#8208;five biindoles, including eighteen new compounds. The reactions run quickly under mild conditions by microwave heating at 70&#8201;&#176;C, with yields ranging from good to very good. The reaction scope is rather broad. The medium demonstrated to be reusable at least five times with only a slight reduction in yields. Based on experimental evidence and previous literature findings, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Syntheses and Preliminary Biological Evaluations of the Dibromopyrrole&#8208;Containing Marine Natural Products Agesasine A, Agesasine B, Longamide E and Various Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of various, recently reported, marine&#8208;derived, pyrrole&#8208;containing natural products are reported. The evaluation of these and certain congeners, some of which were prepared by potentially biomimetic means, against a panel of four human&#8208;cancer cell lines reveals significant variations in activity as a function of structure.







Abstract
Total syntheses of the title marine natural products have been achieved and so confirming the structures originally assigned to them. Upon subjecting agesasine A and its corresponding ethyl ester to Mitsunobu conditions, a 1,5&#8208;cyclodehydration reaction takes place to give 2&#8208;oxazolines. In contrast, on subjecting agesasine B to the same Mitsunobu conditions, a simple dehydration reaction occurs to give the corresponding acrylate. A total synthesis of longamide E was achieved by engaging a 1,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrole in a lactam&#8208;forming reaction and this was followed by a two&#8208;fold and fully regio&#8208;controlled bromination reaction. A distinctly different and possibly biomimetic route was used to synthesize, via the open&#8208;chain natural product nakamurine B, longamide B and its methyl ester. Preliminary biological evaluations of the title alkaloids and various analogues against a small human cancer cell line panel reveals cytotoxic properties that vary significantly with structure.

         <title>Tetrathiaporphyrine: A Novel Natural Product from Allium Subgenus Melanocrommyum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structure of a red pigment from Allium species, subgenus Melanocrommyum, has been successfully elucidated using X&#8208;ray crystallography. This revealed the compound to be a tetrathiaporphyrine, which has been synthesized in two steps starting from pyrrole.







Abstract
A novel purple&#8208;red pigment from the plant genus of Allium (onions, leeks), subgenus Melanocrommyum (drumstick onions), is described. Because of this pigment, which reminds of blood, some species of the subgenus Melanocrommyum are used in Southwest and Central Asia as herbal medications, as spices or as vegetables. A proposal for the formation of this structure is provided, which is the first example of a tetrathiaporphyrin in nature. The described substance shows low stability towards thermal stress, light and oxidant; additionally, its symmetric nature made structural elucidation a challenge. It could be shown that, contrary to previous reports, the structure of the red pigment is that of a tetrathiaporphyrin. Full structure elucidation was only possible by X&#8208;ray crystallography and total synthesis of the intended molecule. Further on, the newly discovered red pigment was used for the modification of nanoparticles and monitoring its polymerization events using SPR.

         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as one of the important endogenous biological regulator, playing a critical role in mediating a wide range of physiological processes.

In this paper, a new type of AIE&#8208;based fluorescence "turn&#8208;on" probe TPA&#8208;M&#160;for the detection of H2S has been constructed.

         <title>Axial Chirality in Alkylidene&#8208;Cyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial chirality is an interesting stereoisomeric phenomenon in organic chemistry and a key structural feature of several organic compounds. Atropisomer such as biaryls, anilides and diaryl ethers is one type of axially chiral compound, whose axial chirality is resulted from rotationally blocked C&#8211;X (C, N, O) single bond. Allenes, spiranes and alkylidenecycloalkanes are another type of axially chiral compounds and their axial chirality come from the perpendicular geometry of two pairs of substituents. The axial chirality in atropisomers, allenes and spiranes have been widely investigated and well developed, while the similar chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules gained very limited attentions. This concept focuses on summarizing recent advances of axial chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules and arouses the research interests to this promising field.</dc:description>

Abstract
A rapid and efficient acid&#8208;promoted strategy to access allylic thiocyanates using allylic alcohols as substrates and easily&#8208;available NH4SCN as the thiocyanate source is presented under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Through screening of various kinds of acids, organic and strong trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was found most effective. Testing of substrates showed that the strategy has remarkable functional group tolerance. A possible mechanism is provided, and the gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrate that this novel protocol has potential industrial application value.

         <title>Chemistry and Applications of Functionalized 2,4&#8208;Thiazolidinediones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiazolidinedione (TZD) is one of the privileged heterocyclic rings and has shown many biological applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. The manuscript covers the synthetic approaches of TZD and its derivatives, different synthetic techniques for affording the desired regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, and the techniques that would enhance reaction conditions such as microwave, one&#8208;pot, ultrasound synthesis. One of topics focused in this review is the synthetic challenges of glitazones and the transformation of other heterocycles to TZD. Moreover, the current review discusses the chemical and biological behavior of TZD through the substitution in the N3 position, modification of the C5 position, annealing in complex heterocyclic systems, and hybridization with other pharmacologically attractive moieties. All reactions mentioned are provided as possible with different reaction conditions, mechanisms, derivatives scope, yield and clarified by applications of such reactions in the construction of potential medicinal agents. The review also answers questions about rapid racemization of glitazones, their toxicity, considering TZD as pan&#8208;assay interference compounds (PAINS) or not, and the influence of saturation of 5&#8208;position of TZD in their biological activities. The main objective of the current review is to guide the reader to make informed decisions for construction of TZD derivatives with biological potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Controlled Hydrogenation of Flavanones: Selective Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;Diarylpropanes and Flavans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new substrate&#8208;controlled hydrogenation of flavanones to selectively obtain 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes or flavans depending on the substitution of the flavanone moiety is described. Thus, hydrogenation of non&#8208;fluorinated flavanones provided the corresponding 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes, whereas hydrogenation of fluorinated flavanones afforded selectively the corresponding flavans in excellent yields.







Abstract
A new substrate&#8208;controlled hydrogenation of flavanones to selectively obtain different hydrogenation products is herein reported. Thus, hydrogenation of flavanones bearing different electron&#8208;donating and electron withdrawing substituents (Cl, Br, Me, OMe, OH) provided the corresponding 1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes in excellent yields. This procedure offers a straightforward, simple, and cost&#8208;effective method for the preparation of glycosylated 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes derived from natural flavanones such as Naringin and Hesperedin. On the contrary, when the hydrogenation was performed over fluorinated flavanones, the corresponding flavans were selectively obtained in excellent yields.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylation: Extended Substrate Scope and Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid sidechains have been functionalized and glycosylated without the aid of catalysts or additives. Disarmed glycosyl donors were found to react efficiently and excess glycosyl acceptor as well as trichloroacetamide could effectively be removed by aqueous workup. The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;promoted glycosylation was studied by constructing Hammett plots.







Abstract
A self&#8208;promoted glycosylation method for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;glucosides from a substrate library of glycosyl trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors and glycosyl acceptors is presented. The simple two&#8208;component reaction takes place at elevated temperatures, without the addition of any additives or catalysts. After a simple basic workup, N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in good yields and with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and hence this method allows for easy access to glycoconjugates under very mild conditions. The influences of neighboring group participation and substituents, in both the glycosyl donor and acceptor, were studied. Kinetic data were obtained from in&#8197;situ IR and these were used for a Hammett study. A connection between the pKa of the acceptor and reaction rate was found and new mechanistic insight in self&#8208;promoted glycosylations gained.

         <title>White Light/NIS&#8208;Promoted Aminoselenylation of Alkenes by Using N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and diorganyl diselenides for the synthesis of organylselenylethyl sulfonylhydrazones is disclosed, in which 42 products were synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (51&#8201;%&#8211;85&#8201;%). In addition, the reaction proceeded well at room temperature in air, without any metal, using ethyl acetate as an environmentally benign solvent.







Abstract
A white light/iodosuccinimide (NIS)&#8208;promoted three component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones, and diorganyl diselenides for synthesis of organylselenylethyl sulfonylhydrazones under air is disclosed. This intermolecular aminoselenylation of alkenes using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as nitrogen source was performed under mild conditions and well tolerated for common groups. In addition, heteroaryl and aliphatic diselenides also gave the target compounds. Gram&#8208;scale reaction also carried out smoothly. This protocol has a wide range of substrates and affords moderate to high yields and excellent regioselectivities. The photoactive intermediates from the interaction between NIS and diphenyl diselenide was detected by UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra, which matches the wavelength of the applied white LED. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on UV&#8208;visible light experiments and control experiments.

         <title>Pd/Ni Co&#8208;catalyzed Selective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Bromides and Aryl Fluorosulfonates at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a method for the synthesis of biaryls using inexpensive aryl fluorosulfonates coupled with electrophilic reagents, which enhances the selectivity of the cross&#8208;coupling products by palladium and nickel cooperative catalysis. This reaction can be carried out at room temperature with excellent yields.







Abstract
Multimetallic catalysis can effectively enhance the selectivity for the heterocoupling product over homocoupling products in cross&#8208;electrophilic couplings. We report the selective cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with aryl fluorosulfonates via palladium and nickel cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of biaryls, which can be carried out at room temperature while having marvelous chemoselectivity. In addition, the reaction also has a good performance on the gram&#8208;scale reaction.

         <title>A Historical Review of the Total Synthesis of Natural Products Developed in Portugal</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the strategies for the natural product synthesis that were developed in Portugal in the past five decades, including alkaloids, cyclitols, phenylpropanoic acids, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones, fatty alcohols, xanthones and nucleosides.







Abstract
Total synthesis of natural products is an important discipline of organic chemistry that has enabled the development of new synthetic methods and strategies for the preparation and study of the structure and reactivity of complex naturally occurring products. In this review we summarize the synthetic strategies developed in Portugal by several research groups for the synthesis of bioactive natural products including alkaloids, cyclitols, fatty alcohols, phenylpropanoic acids, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones, xanthones and nucleosides.

A TiCl4 Lewis acid&#8208;mediated domino semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction&#8208;based approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (+)&#8208;7 and azatricyclic core of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (+)&#8208;8&#8201;a.







Abstract
A concise approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of the azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (8&#8201;a) and (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (8&#8201;b) using stereoselective domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction as a key step. In presence of TiCl4, the oxaspiropentane&#8208;azide derivatives underwent stereoselective domino cyclization to furnish the corresponding angularly fused azatricyclic cores in very good yields. Moreover, azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A has also been realized, in a stepwise manner, through the intramolecular Schmidt reaction of azido&#8208;spirocyclobutanone intermediate. The synthetic utility of domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction is further shown in the diastereoselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (7).

         <title>Reactions in Endohedral Functionalized Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds play an increasing role in cage chemistry. Here, the recent developments of reactions that are mediated or catalyzed by such endohedral&#8208;functionalized cages is reviewed. The article is structured according to the role that the endohedral group plays with respect to the reaction mediated or catalyzed.







Abstract
The introduction of enhanced functionalization is a key aspect in the current design of cage chemistry. At the moment, several approaches are intensively investigated. The synthesis of cage compounds that display endohedral functionalization plays a key role among them. Here, the studies of reactions that occur in endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds is reviewed. After an introduction in current trends in cage&#8208;chemistry the discussion of reactions in endohedral&#8208;cage compounds is divided into three sections. These are: 1) Endohedral groups that are by themselves functional, 2) endohedral groups that can bind to a transition&#8208;metal complex and 3) endohedral groups that can bind by themselves to a metal. The article closes with an outlook on additional current developments in the field of endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage&#8208;compounds, which may contribute in the future towards reactivity in cage compounds.

         <title>Pyridine Adducts of Tricyano&#8208; and Dicyanoboranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient syntheses for pyridine and 4&#8208;cyanopyridine adducts of the strong Lewis acids BH(CN)2, B(CN)3, and BF(CN)2 starting from readily available hydridoborates are described. The different Lewis acidities of the three boranes have been assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Becket method and by calculated fluoride ion affinities (FIA). In addition, the electrochemical properties of the borane adducts have been studied by cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Cyanoborane adducts of the Lewis acids B(CN)3, BF(CN)2, and BH(CN)2 with pyridine and 4&#8208;cyanopyridine have been obtained in high yields. The syntheses were accomplished by oxidation of the readily available potassium salts of the cyano(hydrido)borate anions [BH(CN)3]&#8722; (MHB), [BFH(CN)2]&#8722; (FHB), and [BH2(CN)2]&#8722; (DHB) with bromine in the presence of the respective pyridine derivative C5H5N or 4&#8208;CN&#8208;C5H4N as starting material. All six cyanoborane adducts have been characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The reduction of the cyanoborane adducts has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and the Lewis acidity of the different cyanoboranes has been assessed using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. Selected experimental data and trends are compared to theoretical ones, for example fluoride ion affinities (FIAs).

         <title>Photoacidity of Indolinospirobenzopyrans in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolinospirobenzopyrans in their open protonated form constitute the archetype of &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221;, as they can release protons persistently and reversibly following visible light absorption. In this Review, we survey their wide&#8208;spread applicability by contextualizing the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release in water.







Abstract
The reversible isomerism of indolinospirobenzopyrans is perhaps among the most studied phenomena in the field of molecular switches. Although they began to gain attention as early as 70&#8197;years ago following the seminal work of Hirshberg and Fischer, who were the first to recognize their photochromic behaviours, their implementation as photoacids emerged prominently only in the last decade. In this Review, we contextualize the prerequisites underlying the photo&#8208;triggered proton release that occurs in these molecular switches, highlighting the most recent advances in their characterization and application as &#8220;metastable&#8208;state photoacids&#8221; in water.

&lt;p&gt;Indolinospirobenzopyrans in their open protonated form constitute the archetype of &#8220;metastable-state photoacids&#8221;, as they can release protons persistently and reversibly following visible light absorption. In this Review, we survey their wide-spread applicability by contextualizing the prerequisites underlying the photo-triggered proton release in water.

         <title>Electrochemical Borylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes and Allenoates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical borylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and allenoates is described. In an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, a panel of Michael acceptors and allenoates was readily reacted. The reaction was efficient and the products were obtained in good to excellent yields (20&#8197;examples, 47&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% yield), offering an access to versatile borylated building blocks.







Abstract
The electrochemical borylation of electro&#8208;deficient alkenes and allenoates is disclosed. In an undivided cell and under galvanostatic conditions a panel of Michael acceptor and allenoates was readily reacted. The reaction offered an access to versatile borylated building blocks in good to excellent yields (20 examples, 47&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% yields). A plausible reaction mechanism, based on the literature precedent was suggested.

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Pyridine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Molecules: Recent Strategies and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mind the gap! A practical guide to navigate through the complex network of selective late&#8208;stage functionalisations of pyridine&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation (LSF) is an innovative technique that has been successfully applied to the C&#8722;H diversification of pharmaceuticals. However, LSF of the pyridine ring in drug&#8208;like molecules is often unselective. As a result, a mixture of structurally related products is obtained, thus making the purification tedious and time&#8208;consuming. This review shines a light on recent strategies addressing the selectivity issue in the LSF of complex natural products or drugs containing the pyridine moiety. Specifically, we have reviewed the efforts reported both in academia and industries with the hope of providing a guide for the LSF of elaborated pyridines.

         <title>Ammonium Acetate Catalyzed Formation of 1,5&#8208;Benzodiazepines through [4+2+1] Cycloaddition Involving 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium acetate in ethanol is a clean and efficient protocol for the multicomponent construction of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines, being an appropriately mild catalyst in the case of the acid&#8208;sensitive biobased platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF). The protocol is tolerant to many functional groups in substituted diamines, alkynones or alkyl alkynoates, and furanic aldehydes.







Abstract
The use of the renewable platform molecule 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) in multi&#8208;component reaction with a diamine and an alkynone to generate seven&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines is described. Due to the sensitivity of 5&#8208;HMF to strong acidic and basic conditions, the investigation required an in&#8208;depth revisit of reaction parameters as compared to benchmark aldehydes. Among catalysts/solvents couples, ammonium acetate in ethanol proved to be a clean and efficient system. These optimized conditions were subsequently used to investigate the scope of the reaction providing a library of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in moderate to good yields from a wide range of diversely substituted diamines and alkynones or alkyl alkynoates.

         <title>Co(Salox)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily accessible Salox ligands in combination with cobalt were found to be competent catalysts for the asymmetric conjugate reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, and nitriles with NaBH4 To give enantioselectivity up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er and quantitative yields. Preliminary experiments highlight a relatively complex reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Co&#8208;Salox complexes are suitable catalysts for the reduction of prochiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. These ligands can be prepared in a single step from available and inexpensive materials, thus representing an easily accessible alternative to previously reported Co&#8208;catalysts. NaBH4 is employed as reducing agent in the presence of EtOH as proton source, leading to the stereoselective formation of chiral esters, amides, and nitriles in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er. The concentration of the reductant counter cation (Na+) and the solvent polarity have been shown to correlate with reactivity and enantioselectivity, suggesting that a relatively complex mechanistic manifold is in place.

     alt="Co(Salox)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Esters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily accessible Salox ligands in combination with cobalt were found to be competent catalysts for the asymmetric conjugate reduction of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters, amides, and nitriles with NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; To give enantioselectivity up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 er and quantitative yields. Preliminary experiments highlight a relatively complex reaction mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Salox complexes are suitable catalysts for the reduction of prochiral &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters. These ligands can be prepared in a single step from available and inexpensive materials, thus representing an easily accessible alternative to previously reported Co-catalysts. NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is employed as reducing agent in the presence of EtOH as proton source, leading to the stereoselective formation of chiral esters, amides, and nitriles in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5 &lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt;. The concentration of the reductant counter cation (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and the solvent polarity have been shown to correlate with reactivity and enantioselectivity, suggesting that a relatively complex mechanistic manifold is in place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified by a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.
