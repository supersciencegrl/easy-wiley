         <title>The Mechanism of Lithium Zincate&#8208;Mediated I/Zn Exchange Revisited: A Computational Microsolvation Approach in THF
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solv(at)ing the mechanism of lithium zincate&#8208;mediated I/Zn exchange: A computational study through microsolvation approach in tetrahydrofuran is conducted to decipher this mechanism. Three pathways are discussed using new methodologies like IGM, IBSI and NBO. The preferential one proceeds through a two&#8208;step mechanism involving a THF&#8208;solvated open form zincate which firstly acts as a converter of aryl iodide into aryllithium.







Abstract
Lithium trialkylzincate&#8208;mediated I/Zn exchange reaction has been revisited computationally through a microsolvation approach. A never yet investigated iodoaryl derivative bearing a potential bulky para&#8208;directing group, namely 4&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate, was considered as a substrate. THF as typical solvent and Et3ZnLi have also been considered for the first time in such a reaction. Three mechanistic pathways have been calculated, including (1) a literature&#8208;inspired pathway with full preservation of the synergic character of the reagent as well as a complementary mesylate group&#8208;directed pathway, (2) a THF&#8208;solvated open complex&#8208;promoted pathway and (3) an anionic pathway. While the anionic pathway appeared to be unlikely, pathway involving a THF&#8208;solvated open zincate complex turned out to be the most energetically favored. Equivalent thermodynamic profiles were found for both complementary pathways with preservation of the synergic character of the reagent, albeit a slight preference could be attributed to that occurring with initial chelation of Li to the mesylate group (OMs) through microsolvation approach. The I/Zn exchange was shown to proceed through a lithium&#8208;assisted aryl shuttle&#8208;like process. The iodoaryl substrate is first converted into ArLi intermediate which in turns reacts with the remaining diorganozinc reagent.

         <title>An Efficient Chemoenzymatic Route to Biologically Active Pyridinic Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of optically active pyridinic and dipyridinic ethanamines have been prepared by means of a chemoenzymatic route starting from 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethanones. Two features of the strategy need to be he highlighted: the highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED)&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the starting ketones, and the efficient transformation of the resulting optically active alcohols into the target primary amines.







Abstract
Starting from the easily prepared 1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208; or 1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearer of different substituents (cyclohexyl, phenyl, pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) in the position 2, the corresponding primary pyridinic ethanamines have been synthesized in very high enantiomeric excesses (ee&#8805;97&#8201;%). The strategy involves a highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED) catalyzed reduction, mesylation of the resulting optically active alcohol followed by nucleophilic substitution with azide anion and, finally, reduction of the azide function. Some of these pyridinic amines obtained in such manner are precursors of biologically active compounds such as Ontazolast.

         <title>Synthesis of Donor Substituted Chlorophyll Derivatives for Applications in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of photosynthesis can provide a blueprint for environmentally friendly approaches for sustainable production of green renewable energy and organic matter by artificial photosynthesis. Chlorophylls themselves produced by nature as an almost unlimited resource mark them as attractive pigments for application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).







Abstract
Organic dyes based on chlorophyll derivatives were synthesized and investigated with respect to applications in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis cultivated on large scales in tropical areas around the Pacific Ocean is an attractive source for production and isolation of pure chlorophyll a. Direct transformation of chlorophyll a into very robust chlorin e6 trimethylester 3 affords an ideal platform for synthesis of dyes for artificial photosynthesis. A series of molecules 24&#8211;32 with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structures and functional groups for immobilization on TiO2 were achieved by subsequent synthetic modifications of 3. Photochemical, theoretical and electrochemical properties of dyes were investigated and their sensitized solar cells performances studied after immobilization on TiO2.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Benzofused Five&#8208;Membered N/O/S&#8208;Heterocycles, a Progressive Area in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, and their well&#8208;established synthetic pathways are reviewed.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, possessing a single heteroatom, have important applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material chemistry. Metal&#8208;catalysed reactions are well&#8208;established synthetic pathways for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, enabling the direct synthesis of heterocycles. This approach offers advantages over traditional methods, such as fewer steps, increased atom economy, low catalyst loading, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Due to their widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry, the formation of C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bonds has gained significant attention. This article focusses on the metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis and corresponding mechanistic approaches for N/O/S&#8208;heterocycles, particularly indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, reviewing the progress of the past five years and discussing unexplored future opportunities.

         <title>Enhanced Long&#8208;Term Stability of a Photosensitizer with a Hydroxamic Acid Anchor in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenothiazine sensitizer bearing hydroxamic acid terminal anchoring groups in place of conventional carboxylic acid units showed enhanced long&#8208;term photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the typical aqueous device medium. These findings can play a relevant role for commercial production of green hydrogen.







Abstract
Climate change mitigation on a global scale will only be possible through the achievement of ambitious decarbonisation goals, requiring an energy transition that involves switching from fossil fuels to clean fuels such as hydrogen. The photocatalytic approach is one of the most studied methods for directly converting sunlight into hydrogen. In this work, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of the PTZ1&#8208;HA dye, which was obtained by replacing the terminal conventional carboxylic anchoring moieties of a previously studied phenothiazine&#8208;based dye (PTZ1) with hydroxamic acid functionalities. The photoinduced performance of the two dyes as photosensitizers was compared in both dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells and dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems. PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts showed improved stability in hydrogen generation due to the introduction of the hydroxamic acid as an alternative anchor group, which was shown to slow down hydrolysis in aqueous media. Even though the light harvesting ability of PTZ1&#8208;HA was lower than that of PTZ1, the higher stability of PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized devices allowed for improved photocatalytic generation of H2 over prolonged periods. The superior long&#8208;term efficiency of the hydroxamic acid based dye is important in view of potential practical applications.

Even though the light harvesting ability of &lt;b&gt;PTZ1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;HA&lt;/b&gt; was lower than that of &lt;b&gt;PTZ1&lt;/b&gt;, the higher stability of &lt;b&gt;PTZ1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;HA&lt;/b&gt;-sensitized devices allowed for improved photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over prolonged periods. The superior long-term efficiency of the hydroxamic acid based dye is important in view of potential practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Pantolactone: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone are reviewed and the advantages and disadvantages of common synthetic strategies are highlighted. Among these strategies, direct asymmetric catalysis using small organic molecules as catalysts is an extremely promising approach for the industrial synthesis of D&#8208;pantolactone owing to its high step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, avoidance of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, and convenient operation. This review offers valuable insights and recommendations for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs, providing new and useful guidance in the field.







Abstract
(R)&#8208;Pantolactone, an intermediate in the syntheses of Vitamin B5 and coenzyme A, is an important chiral molecule often used as a food additive, chiral auxiliary, and chiral starting material for organic transformations. Enantioenriched pantolactones are predominantly produced by biological fermentation and chemical synthesis approaches. Herein, we present a review of recent developments in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone through different methods, and systematically summarize the characteristics and advantageous features of these strategies. Among the strategies discussed herein, the direct asymmetric catalysis of glyoxylate and isobutyraldehyde with small organocatalyst molecules has attracted growing attention owing to its good step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, absence of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, convenient operation, and low catalyst loading. These characteristics render the direct asymmetric route to pantolactone a particularly attractive procedure. This review provides valuable guidance for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs.

A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans, which produced to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones under heating conditions.







Abstract
A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans from 1,4&#8208;enediones at room temperature. This transformation involves aza&#8208;Michael addition, intramolecular bicyclization, and rearrangement processes. In addition, the 4&#8208;ureidofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate ester products can further be converted to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones through intramolecular substitution cyclization under heating conditions.

         <title>The Mechanism of Lithium Zincate&#8208;Mediated I/Zn Exchange Revisited: A Computational Microsolvation Approach in THF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the most favorable calculated transition state (TS) through which the I/Zn exchange reaction of 4&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate with Et3ZnLi proceeds in THF. This TS was located through micro&#8208;solvation approach by contacting a doubly&#8208;THF solvated open zincate complex, identified as one of the 3 limit forms of the reagent, and the iodoaryl derivative. From this TS, the I/Zn exchange product is obtained via a 2 step&#8208;mechanism. First, the ArI substrate is converted into ArLi intermediate which then reacts with the remaining Et2Zn entity.More information can be found in the Research Article by Cl&#233;ment Denhez, Alexandre Vasseur, and co&#8208;workers

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six new isoquinol&#8208;based BODIPY dyes have been synthesized by a two&#8208;step method. Unlike traditional synthetic methods, synthesis did not require the use of oxidizing agents or solvent. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and DFT calculations indicate that the properties associated with the six dyes are very similar with little influence of the meso&#8208;substituents. Viscosity studies identified three of the new dyes having properties of molecular rotors for applications in the detection of changes in cellular viscosity. Incubation of the dyes with the HEK cell line show no toxicity up to 10 &#956;M over a 72 h. period. The dyes show the ability to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. With two of the dyes showing favorable comparisons to commercially available ER dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoisomerization of Alkenes via Energy Transfer Enabled by Cu&#8208;Acetylide Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates the isomerization of alkenes enabled by copper&#8208;acetylide complexes under blue light. This system is applicable to the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted cinnamate derivatives with moderate to excellent Z/E ratios. A reaction pathway involving singlet energy transfer (EnT) from the copper&#8208;acetylide complex to the alkene is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Combination Approach in Pd Catalyzed Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Benzothiazole and Benzoxazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the use of ligand combination approach in the Pd catalyzed direct C&#8208;H arylation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole. The combination of two ligands phenanthroline monohydrate (Phen.H2O) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) with Pd&#8208;catalyst have offered the best catalytic properties in the C&#8208;H bond arylation reactions than either of two ligands employed separately in the reactions. This protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope affording C2 arylated benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives in excellent yields. Mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), H/D exchange and competition experiments show that the C&#8208;H bond activation of benzothiazole/benzoxazole is very facile under reaction conditions. Furthermore, different mechanistic pathways originated from the catalytically active species such as Pd(&#951;2&#8208;dba)L (dba = dibenzylidene acetone) and Pd(PPh3)2 were investigated using computational methods. The computational results suggest that the generation of catalytically active species from Pd2(dba)3 is endoergic process and Phen ligand can initiate this step. On the other hand, the presence of PPh3 could be crucial for the oxidative addition of aryl halides which is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8208;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY NMR, Mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.</dc:description>

The regioselective functionalization in C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;7 positions was investigated.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Substituted Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward approach to &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted saturated bicyclic amines starting from commercially available compounds is proposed. The key steps include addition of the Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent to imine moiety and AlMe3&#8208;promoted intramolecular hetero&#173;cyclization. The reaction sequence provides an access to fluorine&#8208;containing azabicyclo[n.2.1]alkane (n = 1&#8211;3) or azabicyclo[2.2.2]&#173;octane derivatives in 10&#8211;42% overall yield. The physicochemical properties of the prepared compounds or their model derivatives (i.e., pKa and LogP) were measured and compared to those for the parent monocyclic or non&#8208;fluorinated saturated heterocycles. As expected, amine basicity was lowered considerably upon introduction of the CF3 group (&#916;pKa &#8776; 4), while the lipophilicity increased (by ca. 0.5 LogP units). The summarized data provides a convenient guideline for application of the synthesized compounds in drug discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is a reliable method to prepare important chiral molecules in highly optically enriched forms. Although methods for the catalytic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols, amines, and epoxides have been extensively investigated, the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids has remained under&#8208;developed despite the importance of chiral carboxylic acids. Excellent catalytic approaches for the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids via esterification using chiral organocatalysts have been reported by several research groups. Furthermore, the organocatalyzed lactonization of alkenyl and alkynyl carboxylic acids has also been adapted to achieve kinetic resolution. Herein, the methods typically used to produce the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research.</dc:description>

The key features are the use of sustainable in situ CO surrogate, simple non&#8208;inert conditions, short time, and substrate scope.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Hydrohalogenation and Deuteriohalogenation by Ex Situ Generation of HX and DX Gas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins by ex situ generation of near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas using a two&#8208;chamber reactor. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.







Abstract
The hydrohalogenation of olefins is one of the most straightforward methods to access alkyl halides. Despite safety hazards, using pure hydrogen halide gas remains the most atom economic way of performing hydrohalogenation reactions. In this work, we describe the solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins using down to near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas. Two&#8208;chamber reactors are employed as an enabling platform to access these reactive gases in a laboratory setting. Ex situ generation from inexpensive and readily available precursors provides on&#8208;demand access to these gases (hydrogen chloride, deuterium chloride, hydrogen bromide, deuterium bromide, hydrogen iodide, and deuterium iodide) with precise stoichiometric control. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported structure of janthinolide A has been shown to be incorrect. Comparison of spectroscopic data combined with CASE and DFT methods were used to demonstrate that it is probably identical to janthinolide C.







Abstract
Using computational methods and chemical intuition, the proposed structure of janthinolide A is shown to be incorrect. It is further shown that the material described as janthinolide A is highly likely to be janthinolide C.

         <dc:description>
A novel approach to perform C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization at the C6 position of 7&#8208;azaindazoles is reported. This method employs regioselective oxidative arylation, facilitated by N&#8208;oxide activation. By utilizing this technique, precise and innovative synthesis of C6&#8208;arylated 7&#8208;azaindazoles using various substituted arenes and heteroarenes is achieved.

         <title>Radical Thiocyano(Selenocyano)trifluoromethylations of Alkenes on Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes provides a step&#8208;economical route to CF3&#8208;containing polyfunctionalized organics. New and scalable processes are highly desired in this field. Here, we report a simple and environmentally benign method for olefinic thiocyanotrifluoromethylation. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. All tested reactions are compatible with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes and with high functional group tolerance. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. Therefore, a sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way.

         <title>Ring Expansion Reactions through Intramolecular Transamidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes examples of ring expansion reactions through intramolecular transamidation. This synthetic approach allows the preparation of a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.







Abstract
Synthetic methodologies based on cycle expansion reactions have proven to be highly effective in delivering valuable medium&#8208;sized cycles and macrocycles. A primary method of ring expansion relies on intramolecular transamidation reactions. These reactions typically employ N&#8208;aminoalkyl and N&#8208;aminoacyl derivatives of lactams and their analogues as starting materials, yielding a diverse spectrum of unique nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.
This Review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research outcomes related to intramolecular transamidation reactions that lead to cycle expansion. This will offer the reader a perspective on the potential applications of such reactions in generating novel and intriguing types of heterocyclic systems.

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the potential of difluoromethoxylated ketones as building blocks for accessing challenging structures bearing the key OCF2H motif. These are represented here by a rocket, a highly technical achievement. Obviously, a parallel can be drawn between the building block strategy and a famous construction game. On the righthand side of the cover we can see the rocket heading towards a cell, highlighting the importance of fluorinated molecules in life sciences. Cover design by A. Loison. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Panossian, F. R. Leroux et&#8197;al.

         <title>Two anti&#8208;Prelog NAD&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenases with broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure alcohols are important to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals and fine chemicals. Herein, we explored the substrate scope and chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity of two NAD&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases from Candida maris (Cm&#8208;ADH) and Pichia finlandica (Pf&#8208;ADH) in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The ADHs were tested for the reduction of acetophenone with NADH that was recycled using a formate dehydrogenase and sodium formate. Cm&#8208;ADH and Pf&#8208;ADH performed best at 30 &#176;C and&#160;around pH 7 and pH 6, respectively. Pf&#8208;ADH operated well at 50 mM acetophenone concentration, while Cm&#8208;ADH was limited to 10 mM. Regarding the substrate scope, linear&#8208;chain alkyl ketones were efficiently reduced (up to 98% conversion), while branched and cyclic ketones gave lower conversions (up to 60%). Aryl&#8208;aliphatic ketones showed variable levels of conversion (&lt;1&#8211;79%), while &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated and heteroaromatic ketones exhibited good to excellent conversions. In most of the cases, the enantiomeric excess was &gt;99%. Aliphatic and aryl&#8208;aliphatic aldehydes were converted with up to &gt;99% conversion. A scale&#8208;up experiment with Pf&#8208;ADH using acetophenone as substrate led to 73% isolated yield and &gt;99% ee (R). This work contributes to filling the gap in biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohols by introducing two NAD&#8208;dependent ADHs with anti&#8208;Prelog selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free formylation of imidazopyridines with K2S2O8 by direct decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of glyoxylic acid is described. This reaction features broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and generate products in good yields.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free formylation of imidazopyridines by direct decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of glyoxylic acid in presence of K2S2O8 as oxidant under mild and neutral conditions is described. This reaction features a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and generates products in good yields between 68&#8211;85&#8201;%. The translational capacity of the reaction from a laboratory methodology to gram&#8208;scale synthesis has also been ensured. The involvement of a radical pathway has been demonstrated by radical trapping experiments with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (BHT).

         <title>Development of the Meyer Schuster Rearrangement on Propargylic Alcohols with Fluorinated Chains.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Meyer&#8208;Schuster Rearrangement (MSR) is a challenging process for propargylic alcohols bearing fluorine atom(s) on their chains. Most classical reagents/catalysts failed to perform MSR but, after extensive screening, we demonstrated that phosphomolybdic acid was the first efficient catalyst for MSR with such derivatives. The scope and limitations have been studied, affording fluorine&#8208;containing enones as useful intermediates for the synthesis of targets with fluorine(s) on their side chains. It was exemplified by the preparation of a 2&#8208;piperidino&#8208;pyrimidine and a pyrazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Metallaphotoredox Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reactions: A Perspective on Irradiation Light Wavelength</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of C&#8208;N bonds is considered as the most useful reaction in the synthetic chemistry due to their widespread presence in pharmaceuticals, natural products, etc.. Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA) has provided the most efficient method to form (hetero)aryl amines but requiring strong base and sophisticated ligands. In comparison, the combination of photocatalysis and nickel chemistry has revolutionized catalytic strategies and is emerging as a quintessence to realize BHAs, termed as Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA. To pursue a universal protocol, diverse photocatalysts are designed and employed in Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA, and smoothly promote C&#8208;N bond formations under irradiation of light from ultraviolet to red light respectively. Note that the matching of photocatalyst and light is critical to the success. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the discussion of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHAs according to irradiation light&#8217;s wavelength, covering ultraviolet, purple, blue, red and white light as well as solar light. We try to find a clue in structure&#8208;photophysical behaviors of photocatalysts under the same or different irradiation light. At last, current limitations and potential trends for advancing Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHAs are highlighted. We deem that it could encourage chemists to continue designing suitable photocatalyst for C&#8208;N bond formations under sunlight mimicking plants'&#160;photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Disulfide bonds play a critical role in the pharmaceutical and biological properties of peptides. In this work, disulfiram and thiram were investigated to synthesize disulfide bonds in peptides. Excellent purities of single disulfide bond&#8208;containing peptides were achieved with a fast reaction rate. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of two disulfide bonds was successfully achieved by the combination of disulfiram or thiram with trans&#8208;[PtBr2(CN)4]2&#8208; under aqueous conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy for Improving the Efficiency of Boronic Acid Catalysis in the Synthesis of Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel boronic acids have been developed for the catalyzed amide synthesis. Lewis acidity estimation using DFT, associated with collected kinetic data, allowed to uncover ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art boronic acids. Efficient coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids as well as primary and secondary amines were obtained.







Abstract
This study outlines the development of novel boronic acids as catalysts for the direct synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines. The Lewis acidity of the boronic acids was estimated by means of computational techniques, and the observed increase in catalytic activity was corroborated by kinetic data derived from a model reaction. Our investigations led to the discovery of a set of ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. These newly developed catalysts demonstrated efficacy in the coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic acids, as well as primary and secondary amines.

         <title>Hydroxynitrile Lyase Discovery, Engineering and Promiscuity Towards Asymmetric Synthesis: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) primarily catalyze the stereoselective synthesis of cyanohydrins, but some of them also carry out asymmetric nitroaldol synthesis (Henry reaction). By virtue of the importance of asymmetric C&#8208;C bond formation, and the wide application of chiral cyanohydrins and &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, HNLs have gained significance in organic synthesis. Over the years new HNLs have been discovered and their synthetic scope are evaluated. Engineering of HNLs has contributed towards increasing not only the catalytic toolbox but also broad substrate selectivity, stereoselectivity, enzyme stability and application of the enzymes for different transformations other than the conventional ones. This review describes the recent discoveries of diverse hydroxynitrile lyases, and the developments to date since 2016, with respect to their biocatalytic applications in the asymmetric synthesis using both natural and promiscuous reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fused Tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;Iminosugar Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the catalysis of Yb(OTf)3, the cyclization of iminium&#8208;ion intermediates and imines was promoted through the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism, providing a simple reaction for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;iminosugars derivatives with good stereoselectivity. The absolute structures of compounds 1&#8201;a and 5&#8201;a were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and 2D NMR.







Abstract
An efficient and simple one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally diverse novel tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused iminosugars was developed through the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism. The adaptability of this method has been demonstrated by a variety of imines and d/l&#8208;ribose tosylates, and both, electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituted imines proceed well. In addition, this reaction is characterized by simple operation, good yield, and high atom economy. Some synthetic iminosugars showed moderate anti proliferation of HCT116 tumor cells.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Profiling of Benzofuro&#8208;Fused 7&#8208;Deazapurine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

Design and synthesis of various benzofuro&#8208;fused 7&#8208;deazapurine (6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribo&#8208; and ribonucleosides is reported. The synthesis route comprises Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of iodobenzofurane with zincated 4,6&#8208;dichloropyrimidine followed by azidation and photochemical cyclization. Glycosylation of the heterocycle with either Hoffer's chlorodeoxyribose or protected ribose followed by cross&#8208;coupling or substitution reactions at position 10 gave the desired two sets of final nucleosides that showed moderate to weak cytostatic activity and interesting fluorescence properties.







Abstract
A series of benzofuro&#8208;fused 7&#8208;deazapurine (6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribo&#8208; and ribonucleosides was designed and synthesized. The synthesis of key compound 10&#8208;chloro&#8208;6H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;e]pyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]indole was based on the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of iodobenzofurane with zincated 4,6&#8208;dichloropyrimidine followed by azidation and photochemical cyclization.

         <title>Ex&#8208;Situ Generation of Bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide and Applications to Trifluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an operationally simple protocol for the ex&#8208;situ generation of the toxic and volatile disulfide, CF3SSCF3, from the readily available and cost&#8208;efficient Langlois reagent is reported. Among the trifluoromethythiolations reaction studied, application of this disulfide in a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl boronic acids is disclosed, showing good to excellent yields of trifluoromethylthio&#8208;substituted aryl products.







Abstract
Herein, a convenient and operationally simple protocol for the ex&#8208;situ generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfide from the readily available and commercial Langlois reagent is reported. The one&#8208;step synthesis of the toxic and volatile CF3SSCF3 is performed in a two&#8208;chamber reactor with simple PPh3 and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as the activator, allowing for the safe handling and tandem utilization in direct trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. The versatility of the ex&#8208;situ generated CF3SSCF3 is demonstrated in known electrophilic, nucleophilic, and a radical trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Furthermore, the application of the CF3SSCF3 in a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with boronic acids is disclosed, showing good to excellent yields of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aryl products, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

         <title>DFT Studies on Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Secondary Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT computations were carried out on Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of SPOs, and a modified mechanism including tautomerization and arylation was presented. Various tautomerization mechanisms have been investigated, and the results highlight the catalytic effect of base on this process. Further computations indicate that oxidative addition is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, and the origin of selectivity was thought to be the difference in non&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
Asymmetric arylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) has been rapidly developed, while there are few theoretical studies reported. DFT computations were carried out to study the whole catalytic cycle of Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of SPOs, and a modified mechanism including tautomerization and arylation was presented. Some new tautomerization mechanisms have been traversed, including base&#8208;assisted and Pd/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed tautomerization. These are different from the existing report, where base&#8208;assisted tautomerization is the most favored. The resulting intermediate enters the downstream arylation directly. Furthermore, oxidative addition is identified as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. IGMH analysis results indicate that the different non&#8208;bonding interactions between Xiao&#8208;Phos and SPO parts determine the enantioselectivity. This work not only provides deeper insights into the self&#8208;adaptive property of SadPhos ligands but also offers valuable guidance for ligand design. Newly proposed tautomerization mechanisms will also bring some inspiration to subsequent related research.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids is disclosed. The catalytic system is composed of naturally occurring Mohr salt and readily available di(2&#8208;picolyl)amine. A range of ketones, aldehydes and amides were efficiently obtained including marketed drug derivatives. A mechanistic rational is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and UV&#8211;Vis monitoring.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible light&#8208;driven, dioxygen mediated decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids is disclosed. The catalytic system based on naturally existing Mohr salt and simple di(2&#8208;picolyl)amine ligand is readily available and inexpensive. The applicability of the method was demonstrated through the efficient and selective synthesis of a range of ketones, aldehydes and amides including drug derivatives. Based on experimental investigations, a hypothetical mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Green Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Unsubstituted Isoquinolones through Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation and Annulation in Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for synthesizing 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolines has been developed via rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and annulation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mild and convenient synthesis of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones has been achieved from N&#8208;methoxybenzamides and vinylene carbonate as an acetylene surrogate with a versatile rhodium(III) catalyst. The reaction proceeded at room temperature in biomass derived ethanol solvent. This protocol avoids the use of stoichiometric external oxidant, as the vinylene carbonate served as the internal oxidant. The C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activation and annulation manifold proceeded with broad substrate scope and excellent levels of regioselectivities. The preliminary mechanistic studies suggest facile and reversible chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H rhodation. Diversification of 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolones provide access to 4&#8208;substituted isoquinolones and 3,4&#8208;unsubstituted isoquinolines, which are complementary to the previously reported protocols.

         <title>UVA&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Aerobic Oxidation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the irradiation source wavelength provides the advantage in developing a catalyst&#8208;free photooxidative protocol based on boronic acid&#8208; DIPEA complex's ability to generate reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The hydroxy group, and the phenol moiety in particular, is ubiquitous in several natural products, in organic synthesis and/or pharmaceutical industry. With the uprise of photoredox catalysis, many efforts worldwide focus on developing novel and sustainable protocols, providing an easy access to hydroxy&#8208;containing molecules. Boronic acids and boronic ester derivatives are considered valuable precursors for the synthesis of hydroxy group derivatives. Herein, we report a novel, sustainable, light&#8208;driven protocol, where the impact of wavelength irradiation on boronic acid aerobic photooxidation was examined. In this work, UVA&#8208;light (370&#8197;nm) irradiation was found to promote the photocatalyst&#8208;free aerobic oxidation of boronic acids and boronic acid derivatives. Furthermore, a broad scope of substrates was tested, and extensive mechanistic studies were performed in order to probe the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Aldol/Brook/Carbon Skeletal Rearrangement Cascade Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Silyl Ketones with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenylation of aldehydes with &#946;&#8208;silyl ketones proceeded to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with skeletal rearrangement. The reaction mechanism involved tandem aldol/[1,4]&#8208;Brook/1,2&#8208;addition/ring cleavage of cyclopropane. [1,4] Brook rearrangement took place with complete inversion of configuration at the carbon center.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Silyl ketones reacted with aldehydes by treatment with KMMDS in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 to give &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones accompanied with a skeletal rearrangement. The reactions proceeded by aldol reaction of &#946;&#8208;silyl ketones with aldehydes followed by [1,4]&#8208;Brook rearrangement and intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition to form cyclopropanol derivatives, in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage took place to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones were prepared in a one&#8208;pot manner by conjugate addition of silyl anions to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones followed by reactions with aldehydes.

         <title>Protocell Communication through the Eyes of Synthetic Organic Chemists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, the bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries utilised for protocell communication are reviewed and categorised into enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated systems. Future opportunities for synthetic chemists to develop new bio&#8208;inspired and fully synthetic alternatives to these bio&#8208;derived machineries in the form of synthetic enzymes or &#8220;synzymes&#8221; are highlighted.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up fabrication of synthetic cells (protocells) from molecules and materials, is a major challenge of modern chemistry. A significant breakthrough has been the engineering of protocells capable of chemical communication using bio&#8208;derived molecules and ex situ stabilised cell machineries. These, however, suffer from short shelf&#8208;lives, high costs, and require mild aqueous conditions. In this Concept Article we analyse the chemistry at the heart of protocell communication to highlight new opportunities for synthetic chemists in protocell engineering. Specifically, we (i)&#8197;categorise the main bio&#8208;derived chemical communication machineries in enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated communication; (ii)&#8197;review the chemistries of these signal transduction machineries; and (iii)&#8197;introduce new types of bio&#8208;inspired, fully synthetic artificial enzymes to replace their natural counterparts. Developing protocells that incorporate synthetic analogues of bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries will improve the robustness, stability, and versatility of protocells, and broaden their applications to highly strategic fields such as photocatalysis and fine chemicals production.

An efficient copper(II) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex catalyzing the Chan&#8211;Evans&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic nucleophiles with arylboronic acid has been explored. This air&#8208;stable copper catalyst shows practical robustness that tolerates a diverse array of functional groups on both the N&#8208;nucleophile and arylboronic acid coupling partners in C&#8722;N bond forming reactions through the CEL reaction.







Abstract
An efficient copper(II) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex with an NCN coordination mode was optimized to catalyze the Chan&#8211;Evans&#8208;Lam (CEL) cross&#8208;coupling reaction of imidazole and other N&#8208;heterocyclic nucleophiles with arylboronic acid. This air&#8208;stable copper catalyst shows robust catalytic performance and tolerates a diverse array of functional groups on both the N&#8208;nucleophile and arylboronic acid coupling partners in C&#8722;N bond forming reactions with up to 95&#8201;% yield. Formation of the Cu&#8722;NHC complex in&#8197;situ generated similar catalytic performance for CEL coupling. Alternative metal ions (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ru2+, and Pd2+) were also screened in the presence of the NHC precursor as CEL catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Deuterated and Protiated Triacylglycerides by Using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole Activated Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical methodology for the synthesis of triacylglycerides utilizing fatty acids activated by 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was developed to obtain protiated and deuterated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oils as well as a synthetic plant oil mimic. New insights into the mechanism of the CDI activation were gained using deuterated substrates and via density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.







Abstract
Synthetic model triacylglyceride oils are important compounds for applications in pharmaceutical and food chemistry. Herein, a practical and highly efficient methodology for the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated triacylglycerides utilizing saturated and unsaturated fatty acids activated by 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) has been developed and applied in the synthesis of deuterated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil for studies of plant&#8208;based and diary food emulsions. The deuterium labelled compounds were used to gain new insight into the mechanism of the reaction, which was confirmed by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Tumor Carbohydrate Associated Antigen Analogs as Potential Binders for Siglec&#8208;7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding recognition of two structurally constrained sialyl derivatives by Siglec&#8208;7was investigated. The flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allowed the preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound containing a biphenyl moiety. Our results set the basis for the design and development of novel compounds as potential modulators for Siglec&#8208;7.







Abstract
We investigated two recently synthesized and characterized sialyl derivatives, bearing the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, as promising binders for Siglec&#8208;7, an inhibitory Siglec mainly found on natural killer cells. A variety of sialoglycan structures can be recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 with implications in the modulation of immune responses. Notably, overexpression of sialylated glycans recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 can be associated with the progression of several tumors, including melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. NOE&#8208;based NMR techniques, including Saturation Transfer Difference and transferred&#8208;NOESY NMR, together with molecular docking and dynamic simulations were combined to shed light on the molecular basis of Siglec&#8208;7 recognition of two conformationally constrained Sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen analogs. We, therefore, identify the ligands epitope mapping and their conformational features and propose 3D models accurately describing the protein&#8208;ligand complexes. We found that the binding site of Siglec&#8208;7 can accommodate both synthetic analogs, with the sialic acid mainly involved in the interaction. Moreover, the flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allows a preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound bearing a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid that contributed to the interaction to a large extent. Our findings provided insights for developing potential novel high affinity ligands for Siglec&#8208;7 to hinder tumor evasion.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Defluoroborylation of 3,3&#8208;Difluoropropenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free defluoroborylation of 3,3&#8208;difluoropropenes has been developed. The reaction involves the convenient borylation agent B2pin2 and a combination of both TBAF and HMDS as an activating system. The fluorinated allylboronates were used as a platform to prepare functionalized monofluoroalkenes.







Abstract
The defluorinative functionalization of allylic fluorides represents an attractive approach for the preparation of molecules containing a monofluoroalkene core. In that sense, introducing a &#8220;boryl nucleophile&#8221; is a powerful strategy to obtain polyvalent borylated intermediates as versatile synthetic precursors. To perform this reaction without the use of transition metals, the nucleophilic character of a diborane/fluoride system was exploited in a SN2&#8242; type&#8208;substitution reaction of gem&#8208;difluoropropenes to install a pinacolborane group. The use of HMDS as a silylated additive is necessary to improve the reactivity. A direct oxidation of the intermediate boronates allowed the isolation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;fluoroallyl alcohols in low to good yields (9&#8211;81&#8201;%). Other synthetic transformations of a (2&#8208;fluoroallyl)boronate are also illustrated.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Synthesis of Optically Active Drug (S)&#8208;Clopidogrel</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step four reactions innovative asymmetric synthesis of popular antiplatelet drug (S)&#8208;clopidogrel, marketed as Plavix, has been developed. The telescoped approach relies on the use of a sole organocatalyst, commercially available reagents and a single solvent. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions enabled isolation of the drug in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A first catalytic preparation of the popular antiplatelet drug (S)&#8208;clopidogrel, known with the tradename of Plavix, has been developed in a one&#8208;pot and innovative approach. The synthesis can be performed using commercially available ortho&#8208;chlorobenzaldehyde, 1&#8208;naphthylsulfonyl acetonitrile, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyridine and 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a quinidine derived organocatalyst in a single solvent. A Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) sequence enabled to obtain (S)&#8208;clopidogrel in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions proved to be crucial to set up a selective and efficient process.

&lt;p&gt;A three-step four reactions innovative asymmetric synthesis of popular antiplatelet drug (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-clopidogrel, marketed as Plavix, has been developed. The telescoped approach relies on the use of a sole organocatalyst, commercially available reagents and a single solvent. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions enabled isolation of the drug in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first catalytic preparation of the popular antiplatelet drug (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-clopidogrel, known with the tradename of Plavix, has been developed in a one-pot and innovative approach. The synthesis can be performed using commercially available &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-chlorobenzaldehyde, 1-naphthylsulfonyl acetonitrile, &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), &lt;a href="https://tcichemicals.com/BE/en/p/T2686"&gt;4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine&lt;/a&gt; and 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a quinidine derived organocatalyst in a single solvent. A Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring-opening esterification (DROE) sequence enabled to obtain (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-clopidogrel in 61&#8201;% overall yield and 62&#8201;% ee. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions proved to be crucial to set up a selective and efficient process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The stereoselective syntheses of three 2,6&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one styryllactones, goniopypyrone, goniochelienlactone and 7&#8208;acetylgoniochelienlactone, has been accomplished based on chiron approach. In particular, (+)&#8208;goniochelienlactone and (+)&#8208;7&#8208;acetylgoniochelienlactone, which are the first total syntheses so far, were achieved in 5 steps (longest linear sequence) with a 28.3&#8201;% overall yield and in 8 steps (longest linear sequence) with a 22.2&#8201;% overall yield, respectively. The feature of this work involved a sequential reaction of Bernet&#8208;Vasella&#8208;type reductive elimination and nucleophilic addition by a one&#8208;pot sequence, sequential crossing metathesis (CM)/intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition, and one&#8208;pot tandem deprotection/lactonization.







Abstract
Stereoselective total syntheses of (+)&#8208;goniochelienlactone, (+)&#8208;7&#8208;acetylgoniochelienlactone and (&#8722;)&#8208;goniopypyrone were accomplished by divergent strategies starting from readily available chiral pool methyl &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranoside. The present work provided an efficient strategy for the stereoselective construction of highly functionalized dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one ring system through a sequential Bernet&#8208;Vasella&#8208;type reductive elimination/nucleophilic addition and a sequential cross&#8208;metathesis/intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael addition in a one&#8208;pot process.

An acid catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation of readily available cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones, arylglyoxals and arylhydrazones produces a library of diversely functionalized pyrazole derivatives in excellent yield under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free benign conditions.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, and atom economic synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically important fully substituted and functionalized pyrazole derivatives has been accomplished under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free benign conditions. The strategy involves early condensation of readily available cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones (dimidone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) and arylglyoxals to generate a chalcone type intermediate which upon acid catalyzed condensation with ambident nucleophile arylhydrazones produces various aryl and cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketone substituted pyrazole derivatives. The synthesis embraces high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, excellent yield of the products, short reaction time and operationally simple and mild reaction conditions. The synthesis provides an easy opportunity of incorporating biologically important N&#8208;diarylsulfide/selenide functionality, various enolisable cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones and other bioactive heterocycles concurrently to pyrazole, which may help in designing and development of pyrazole derivatives of pharmacological significance.

Abstract
An efficient rhodium(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;indazoles with easily available vinylethylene carbonate has been reported. A series of allyl alcohol substituted 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;indazoles were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance and favourable stereoselectivity. Notably, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;O bonds were selectively activated in &#8220;one pot&#8221; manner, releasing CO2 as the sole by&#8208;product and avoiding external oxidant. This protocol provides a powerful approach for the post stage C&#8722;H allylation of indazole&#8208;based substrates.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Scaffolds for Light Emission</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we reported novel three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores with highly efficient luminescence in both solution and solid states have attracted significant attention due to their ability to circumvent the limitations of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission type molecules. However, their development and wide&#8208;range applications are hampered by extremely complex synthetic methodologies and limited frameworks with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) structural characteristics. In sharp contrast to the reported luminogens with big and planar &#960; systems or highly conjugated and twisted structures, we discovered novel three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance. Our findings should open new avenues for designing DSE molecules with new frameworks, which will enable more successful development of dual&#8208;state emitters for their broad applications in the future.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling between Two Different Tosylates Enabled by Nickel/Palladium Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 40, October 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl tosylate with &#945;&#8208;CF3 benzyl tosylate is presented. This protocol is the first example of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between two different tosylates by Pd/Ni cooperative catalysis.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions are efficient for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds under relatively mild conditions, and hence widely used for making new molecules. Among various electrophiles, the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction between two different tosylates has been rarely studied. Herein, we present a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl tosylate (C(sp2)&#8722;OTs) and &#945;&#8208;CF3 benzyl tosylate (C(sp3)&#8722;OTs) by nickel/palladium cooperative catalysis. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the activation of C(sp2)&#8722;OTs bond and C(sp3)&#8722;OTs bond was facilitated by nickel and palladium respectively.

The Front Cover illustrates a first one&#8208;pot enantioselective preparation of the popular antiplatelet agent Plavix, where two out of the four reactions are selectively promoted by a multi&#8208;functionalised Cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived organocatalyst. The process has been finely tuned to conveniently obtain the drug with high overall yield and satisfactory enantioselectivity. The entire sequence proceeds likewise in a winning 4x100 meter relay final, when each athlete runs at the best. Cover design by F. Fasulo. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Regioselective C3&#8722;H Benzoxylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles with Benzoyl Peroxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;O bond formation reaction for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl benzoates was developed. The C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in acetonitrile at room temperature under open flask conditions is step and reagent economic. Notably, indole&#8208;3&#8208;ylester derivatives represent important structures in various biologically active compounds, such as antivirals, phosphoryl transferase inhibitors, CDK inhibitors, and diagnostic reagents for wounds.







Abstract
An efficient catalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;O bond formation reaction for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl benzoates was developed through C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in acetonitrile at room temperature under open flask conditions. The reaction proceeds without exclusion of air or moisture and is applied to a wide array of electronically differentiated indoles as well as BPOs. C3 benzoxylation of indoles was achieved with excellent regioselectivity under mild and easy to operate conditions. The reaction is scalable to one gram level.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Ribosyl Adenosine 5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;Diphosphate Fragment of Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two synthetic approaches to the poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) fragment via a common precursor were successfully developed. The first approach employed an indirect method that involved stepwise assembly of the ribosyl adenosine framework by O&#8208;ribofuranosylation and subsequent N&#8208;glycosylation. The second approach featured direct O&#8208;ribofuranosylation of a known 6&#8208;chloropurine riboside acceptor. The precursor was converted into a conjugation&#8208;ready building block for oligo(ADP&#8208;ribose) synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosyl adenosine 5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diphosphate is a poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) fragment covalently bonded to a protein during post&#8208;translational modification. Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) is involved in several biological processes such as DNA repair and cancerization. Herein, we report the development of two synthetic approaches to the poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) fragment via a common precursor. The major difficulty in the synthesis of the fragment is the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8242;&#8594;2&#8242;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation between the ribose and adenosine because of the lack of neighboring group participation and low reactivity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl group. The first approach employed an indirect method that involved stepwise assembly of the ribosyl adenosine framework by O&#8208;ribofuranosylation of a commercially available ribose acceptor and subsequent N&#8208;glycosylation of N6&#8208;benzoyl adenine (14 linear longest sequence (LLS) steps, 11 pots, 6.8&#8201;% overall yield). In the second approach, the direct O&#8208;ribofuranosylation of a known 6&#8208;chloropurine riboside acceptor was adopted (12 LLS steps, 10 pots, 4.8&#8201;% overall yield). Thus, two practical synthetic approaches to the target fragment were successfully established in terms of the number of LLS steps, pots, and overall yield. Furthermore, the precursor was converted into a conjugation&#8208;ready building block, primed for application in ADP&#8208;ribose oligomer synthesis.

The first approach employed an indirect method that involved stepwise assembly of the ribosyl adenosine framework by &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-ribofuranosylation and subsequent &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation.

The precursor was converted into a conjugation-ready building block for oligo(ADP-ribose) synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromoisocoumarins through Brominative annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynylaryloate esters using in situ generated transient Bromoiodane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Herein we report, a facile and proficient protocol for the synthesis of 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins via brominative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynylaryloate esters with in situ generated bromoiodane using simple hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and potassium bromide as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated isocoumarins can be obtained with excellent yield at room temperature. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst and exhibits high functional group tolerance. Besides, the reaction can also be extended to the gram scale, and a catalytic approach was also demonstrated. Additionally, the prepared 3&#8208;bromoisocoumarins were further transformed into important synthetic compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkyne group is the key component of many bioactive molecules and versatile synthetic building block, thus the introduction of which into target molecules has attracted considerable interest from scientists. Moreover, tertiary and quaternary stereocenters are common motifs in natural products and drugs, however, the asymmetric construction of such motifs is one of the challenging tasks owe to the steric congestion of multiple stereospecific substituents attached to one carbon. Metal&#8211;allenylidene are an excellent type of electrophilic species. The asymmetric addition of carbon&#8208;nucleophiles at C&#947; of the metal&#8211;allenylidene provides an effective way to construct tertiary and quaternary stereocenters as well as to introduce an alkyne group. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric propargylic C&#8211;C bond formation via metal&#8208;allenylidene generated in situ from propargylic alcohol derivatives are presented.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions for the synthesis of organic molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of enzymes for the synthesis of valuable bioactive molecules, synthetic building blocks, fine chemicals and natural products is now well&#8208;established. Biocatalysis has been embraced by industry for the preparation of both bulk chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, where high activity and selectivity can be achieved with low environmental impact. In most cases, biocatalytic transformations involve&#160;functional group interconversions, such as redox and amination reactions, but do not lead to significant complexity generation in the molecule. This review explores the less prevalent&#160;enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions, where the enzymatic transformation triggers a subsequent spontaneous reaction inter/intramolecularly. The examples highlighted in this review showcase the synthetic power of designing smart substrates for enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions and their application for the preparation of structurally complex three&#8208;dimensional small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Z&#8208;Enantioselective Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview covering all the breakthroughs accomplished in the field of challenging Z&#8208;enantioselective olefin metathesis, which is of interest in the total synthesis of complex molecules.







Abstract
Asymmetric Olefin Metathesis (AOM) represents a highly versatile synthetic tool to lead to relevant chiral building blocks with excellent enantiopurity. As the Z&#8208;alkene moiety is ubiquitous in a wide range of natural products, the development of catalysts which are able to control both the Z&#8208;selectivity and the enantioselectivity of metathesis transformations is in high demands. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview covering all the breakthroughs accomplished in the field of challenging Z&#8208;enantioselective olefin metathesis, which is of interest in the total synthesis of complex molecules.

         <title>Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation Covalent Exchanges on 1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzylic and aliphatic 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium iodides were synthesized to study the influence of the nature and the position of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents on trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions. The kinetic study conducted proved that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions between the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts and an excess of methyl iodide are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones and moderately faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position.







Abstract
1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts having either aliphatic or benzylic substituents at the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 positions were synthesized in two steps involving: i) copper(I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), and ii) N&#8208;alkylation of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole intermediates. Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions in bulk and in the presence of excess methyl iodide were monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy for each 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium molecular model. By assigning the different formed species and their respective evolution with time, it was possible to conclude that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the exchange reactions are noticeably faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position most likely due to the steric hindrance induced by the neighboring C&#8208;4 substituent. The kinetics of trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions are thus influenced by both the chemical nature of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents and the regiochemistry of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium group. This provides important structural design rules to improve the properties of thermosetting covalent adaptable networks involving trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Microwave&#8208;Assisted Sonogashira Reactions of Triflate&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new triflatophenylporphyrin building block for Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions is proposed. Compared to halophenylporphyrins, its purification it is much easier. The triflatophenylporphyrin is also suitable in microwave&#8208;assisted Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling and, to further showcase its utility, has been used to prepare a donor&#8208;acceptor array.







Abstract
Porphyrins that bear halogens at the meso&#8208;aryl positions are useful building blocks for the preparation of light&#8208;harvesting arrays and materials through cross&#8208;coupling procedures. Despite the wide use of such intermediates, their scale&#8208;up and purification are usually hampered by tedious chromatographic separations because of the statistical nature of the synthetic protocol and the similar polarity of the different products. Here, we propose the use of porphyrins bearing a triflatophenyl group as alternative starting materials for palladium cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In particular, purification of the zinc 5,10,15&#8208;triaryl&#8208;20&#8208;(4&#8208;triflatophenyl)porphyrin (ZnP&#8208;OTf) model compound by column chromatography proved to be much easier compared to porphyrin analogues that carry halogen substituents. This is the result of the increased polarity of compounds functionalized by highly polar triflate groups if compared to those substituted by halogens. To show the value of the triflatophenylporphyrin model compound in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we developed a microwave&#8208;assisted Sonogashira protocol that quantitatively converts the ZnP&#8208;OTf to the corresponding alkynylphenylporphyrin, in relatively short reaction times. Finally, we showed that the proposed ZnP&#8208;OTf building block can be conveniently converted into an alkynyl&#8208;linked molecular wire to bridge the zinc porphyrin donor with the [60]fullerene acceptor in a molecular dyad. The prepared dyad showed efficient photoinduced charge separation from singlet ZnP excited state to [60]fullerene in a polar solvent.

     alt="Efficient Synthesis and Microwave-Assisted Sonogashira Reactions of Triflate-Substituted Porphyrin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new triflatophenylporphyrin building block for Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions is proposed. Compared to halophenylporphyrins, its purification it is much easier. The triflatophenylporphyrin is also suitable in microwave-assisted Sonogashira cross-coupling and, to further showcase its utility, has been used to prepare a donor-acceptor array.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porphyrins that bear halogens at the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-aryl positions are useful building blocks for the preparation of light-harvesting arrays and materials through cross-coupling procedures. Despite the wide use of such intermediates, their scale-up and purification are usually hampered by tedious chromatographic separations because of the statistical nature of the synthetic protocol and the similar polarity of the different products. Here, we propose the use of porphyrins bearing a triflatophenyl group as alternative starting materials for palladium cross-coupling reactions. In particular, purification of the zinc 5,10,15-triaryl-20-(4-triflatophenyl)porphyrin (&lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt;) model compound by column chromatography proved to be much easier compared to porphyrin analogues that carry halogen substituents. This is the result of the increased polarity of compounds functionalized by highly polar triflate groups if compared to those substituted by halogens. To show the value of the triflatophenylporphyrin model compound in cross-coupling reactions, we developed a microwave-assisted Sonogashira protocol that quantitatively converts the &lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt; to the corresponding alkynylphenylporphyrin, in relatively short reaction times. Finally, we showed that the proposed &lt;b&gt;ZnP-OTf&lt;/b&gt; building block can be conveniently converted into an alkynyl-linked molecular wire to bridge the zinc porphyrin donor with the [60]fullerene acceptor in a molecular dyad. The prepared dyad showed efficient photoinduced charge separation from singlet ZnP excited state to [60]fullerene in a polar solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epimerization of trans&#8208;Cycloalkenes with the X&#8722;C=C&#8722;SeR*&#8208;Unit &#8211; The Steric Demand of X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3</title>

         <dc:description>
The ring inversion of trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, ring sizes 9&#8211;20, investigated with temperature variable 13C NMR spectroscopy, is a highly sensitive method to characterize the steric demand of substituents: H&#8810;F&#8810;Cl&lt;Me &lt;Br&lt;I&lt;Et&lt;CF&#8323;.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;cycloalkenes with the X&#8722;C=C&#8722;SeR*&#8208;unit and ring sizes from 9 to 20 have been synthesized. R* bonding the selenium atom is the chiral (S)&#8208;o&#8208;(1&#8208;Methoxypropyl)phenyl&#8208;moiety, and X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3. The planar&#8208;chiral trans&#8208;cycloalkenes in combination with the chiral residue R* exist as two diastereomers. These can be distinguished in principle by NMR spectroscopy. Here, we have studied the epimerization of the trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, i.&#8201;e., the 180&#176; rotation of the X&#8722;C=C&#8208;unit through the cavity of the ring. The measurements were done with variable temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy within the range from &#8722;110 to 140&#8201;&#176;C. The obtained values of the Gibbs energy of activation &#916;G&#8800;C depend strongly on the ring size. Furthermore, the &#916;G&#8800;C values show dramatic steric effects due to the groups X. The steric requirement of X increases in the series H&#8810;F&#8810;Cl&lt;Me&lt;Br&lt;I&lt;Et&lt;CF3. Here, F is significantly larger than H, and CF3 is larger than Et. The corresponding iPr&#8208;compounds could not be synthesized. The transition state structures of the ring inversion for ring sizes 8&#8211;20 were calculated at the DFT level of theory.

         <title>Strategies for Carbon Electrophile Addition to Carbonyls and Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls and imines has emerged as a valuable strategy for the construction of C&#8208;C bonds. The merger of this concept with sustainable cobalt catalysis has yielded numerous innovative methodologies. Remarkable functional group tolerance and selectivity have been observed in many cases, providing reliable methods for bond construction. The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed additions of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls, imines and carboxylic acid derivatives described in this review include the earliest reports, such as Takai&#8208;Utimoto Co/Cr co&#8208;catalyzed additions and their progression, as well as modern variants, exemplified by recent Co/photoredox co&#8208;catalyzed protocols.

         <title>28&#960; Non&#8208;Fused Hexaphyrin: Synthesis, Protonation Triggered M&#246;bius Aromaticity and Structural Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of core&#8208;modified 28&#960; non&#8208;fused hexaphyrin is reported. The optical and 1H NMR spectral analysis reveals the non&#8208;aromatic nature of the macrocycle in its freebase form at 298K. However, upon lowering the temperature to 193K a partial aromaticity was observed in 1H NMR experiment. The structural elucidations for the freebase macrocycle also justify the non&#8208;aromaticity of the freebase hexaphyrin, where the thiophene units of the 1,2 diphenyl 1,2 dithienyl ethene moiety is deviated maximum from the overall macrocyclic framework. Protonation on the imino pyrrolic nitrogens results in single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the hexaphyrin&#160;which shows an essential distortion in macrocyclic framework needed for the effective &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, attaining M&#246;bius aromaticity. The Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values for the freebase and protonated macrocycles are &#8208;2.0 ppm and &#8208;5.6 ppm. The Anisotropy Induced Current density shows the clockwise delocalization of current density vectors. Overall, the spectral, structural and theoretical analysis suggests nonaromatic in freebase and M&#246;bius aromatic nature of the protonated hexaphyrin.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient synthetic route to access highly substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones in which the core is formed by fusion of quinolone and pyrrolone moieties is discussed. The method involves Ag(I) catalyzed cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones which in turn may be accessed from kynurenic acid derivatives through Weinreb amide intermediate, followed by alkyne addition. Studies involving substrates with different substitution pattern revealed that factors increasing the nucleophilicity of quinoline nitrogen or Lewis acid&#8208;coordination of the ynone unit gives high yields in short reaction times.

The method involves Ag(I) catalyzed cyclization of 4-Hydroxyquinolinyl-2-ynones which in turn may be accessed from kynurenic acid derivatives through Weinreb amide intermediate, followed by alkyne addition. Studies involving substrates with different substitution pattern revealed that factors increasing the nucleophilicity of quinoline nitrogen or Lewis acid-coordination of the ynone unit gives high yields in short reaction times. It was possible to execute tandem cyclization-arylation sequence by using Pd(II) generated by oxidative addition of Pd(0) with aryl iodide as the electrophilic species to get substitution pattern as seen in Discoipyrrole A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>

A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing reaction and work&#8208;up efficiency was studied using a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains IRED, ADH and NADPH within a superabsorber, in pure organic medium. The reduction of a 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline gave 98&#8201;% conversion, 88&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee at a simplified work&#8208;up based on decantation.







Abstract
A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase (IRED), NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98&#8201;% conversion, 88&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee at a substrate concentration of 40&#8197;mM.

         <dc:description>We report the formation of NHC complexes of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;hydrazino boranes with N&#8211;N&#8211;B and N&#8211;N&#8211;B&#8211;N&#8211;N chains via the reaction of NHC&#8208;boranes with electrophilic azo reagents. The influence of steric hindrance on the carbene and on the azo reagent has been shown to be crucial for the reactivity. The hydroboration of dissymmetric azo reagents is regioselective only when the latter is sufficiently electronically twisted. Bis&#8208;hydrazino borane complexes with two different hydrazine arms could be obtained via sequential addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Exhaustive Reduction of Esters, Carboxylic Acids and Carbamates to Methyl Groups Catalyzed by Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxy to methyl reduction is an important transformation in organic synthesis, yet existing methodologies often require multi&#8208;step procedures or use hazardous metal hydrides. Herein, a metal&#8208;free catalytic system is reported for the one&#8208;step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids, and carbamates to a methyl group, in the presence of catalytic amounts of boronic acids. By using ammonia borane as a hydrogen donor, a wide range of products bearing different functional groups can be obtained in high yields under relatively mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments elucidate the complexity of the mechanism and provide an explanation for the observed selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and optical properties of wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes that has lost some butadiyne spokes were reported. These defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes possess butadiyne&#8208;bridged metacyclophanes with para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene units as the axis. The optimized geometries of the defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes along with their vibrational spectra, HOMO and LUMO orbitals were calculated at B3LYP/6&#8208;311G(d,p) level. HOMO and LUMO orbitals are delocalized mainly over the para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene axis, with weak contribution from the attached ethynyl units. The &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and quantity increase of the para axis influenced the optical properties of these graphdiyne substructures, leading to the change of bandgap from 2.88 eV to 2.56 eV as reflected by optical spectroscopy. The defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes lost the characteristic intensive sharp absorption peak at low energy region, which indicated that the fusion of adjacent dehydrobenzo [18] annulenes are crucial for the bulk properties of graphdiyne.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed radical&#8208;radical reactions have been proven to be powerful strategies for assembling ketyl&#8208;containing compounds via single electron transfer (SET) pathway under either thermal conditions or photoredox conditions. In this context, acylation of alkenes via radical relay under NHC&#8208;organocatalysis has also opened a new window for the difunctionalization of alkenes to construct valuable molecules in organic synthesis. In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems. Conclusions and perspectives were also put forward at the end.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8208;Ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) Group: Generation from Acryloyl Group through Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Addition and Removal by Base&#8208;Triggered Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 5&#8208;ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) group was generated by conversion of acryloyl group through decatungstatecatalyzed addition of C(sp3)&#8211;H bond of i&#8208;BuNH2&#183;HCl under the irradiation of UV light (365 nm or 405 nm). Treatment of Amvprotected alcohols and anilines with aqueous Na2CO3 promoted the efficient deprotection of Amv. This is a unique method for the efficient removal of acryloyl groups from phenols, alcohols, and anilines. The selective removal of acryloyl groups through Amv in the presence of another acetyl or benzoyl group was demonstrated. The basetriggered intramolecular cyclization of Amv was monitored by the release of a fluorescent molecule, and it was found that cyclization by Na2CO3 was very rapid (within 1 min) and that some weak bases such as 2,6&#8208;lutidine are sufficient to promote cyclization.</dc:description>

The approach relies on the use of a linear &#947;&#8208;amino acid surrogate derived from asparagine bearing a &#946;&#8208;dithiolanyl group. A protected dipeptide model system is used to demonstrate that selective removal of the dithioketal protection followed by cyclization gives the target structure in single diastereoisomer form and with little or no dehydration.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient method to synthesize thioethers from readily available sulfonyl chlorides and benzylic trimethylammonium salts via C&#8722;N cleavage of benzyl ammonium salts has been developed. This methodology features mild reaction conditions and good substrate compatibility.







Abstract
A facile and efficient method to synthesize thioethers from sulfonyl chlorides and benzylic trimethylammonium salts is presented. This protocol provides a simple and direct approach to realize the reductive coupling reaction of readily available sulfonyl chlorides with benzyl ammonium salts in the presence of triphenylphosphine along with base via C&#8722;N cleavage of benzyl ammonium salts. This reaction features mild conditions and good substrate compatibility to afford thioethers in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Photoinduced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Cyclic Enones and 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazoles: An Unprecedented Pathway to Polysubstituted Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the syntheses of original pyrazolines and pyrazoles through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic enones with 2,5&#8208;disubstituted nitrile imines achieved via photochemical activation of 2,5&#8208;diaryl substituted tetrazoles. Monitoring of the reactions, similar to nitrile imine&#8208;mediated tetrazole&#8208;ene cycloadditions (NITEC), could be performed by means of UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission measurements. The presence or absence of substituents in the alpha position of the ketone function makes it possible to direct these reactions towards the selective formation of pyrazoles or pyrazolines. The choice of the cyclic enones and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazoles proved crucial for the fluorescence properties of the polycyclic derivatives obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Sulfonium Salts as Aryl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advancements in synthetic applications involving aryl radicals, utilizing aryl sulfonium salts as precursors. This topic, while challenging, holds paramount significance for drug design and the agrochemical industry. The mechanisms underlying these transformations are also discussed.







Abstract
The utilization of aryl radicals as open&#8208;shelled intermediates has become an essential tool for both conventional and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic chemistry. However, the current methods for generating aryl radicals are still inefficient, greatly impeding their practical applications. Encouragingly, sulfonium salts have emerged as appealing sources of aryl radicals for a wide range of transformations aimed at creating novel chemical bonds driven by their distinctive structural attributes and chemical tendencies. This review primarily focuses on the specific reaction mechanisms underlying the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in sulfonium salts, leading to the generation of corresponding aryl radicals within diverse reaction conditions.

         <title>Organometallic Reagents: Efficient Tools for the Synthesis of Fused Pyridinyl&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a one pot synthesis of fused substituted heteroaryl&#8208;lactones involving a Metal/Halogen Exchange reaction as key step, the reactivity of various mono&#8208; or bimetallic reagents (organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes) was explored to aim high chemoselectivity and efficiency starting from sensitive substrates.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot route to a wide range of 3&#8208;substituted fused pyridinyl&#8208;lactones, so called aza&#8208;phthalides. The developed strategy involves a Metal/Halogen Exchange (MHE) reaction as key step, followed by an electrophile trapping using various carbonyl derivatives and a subsequent lactonization. To promote the MHE reaction with high chemoselectivity, our investigations have particularly focused on the nature of mono&#8208; or bimetallic derivatives as metalation reagents including organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes, and highlighted the positive salt effect on reactional sequence. An extension to fused heteroaryl&#8208;lactones (benzothienyl&#8208;, benzofuranyl&#8208; and naphthofuranyl scaffolds) was explored.

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement derived from &#945;&#8208;thioesters/&#945;&#8208;selenoesters and sulfoxonium ylides has been developed for the synthesis of various sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing ortho&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in medium to excellent yields (39 examples; up to 97&#8201;%). Sulfoxonium ylides as the safe carbene precursors are firstly used in Sommelet&#8208;Hauser rearrangement reactions, which is superior to traditional diazo compounds. The present reaction has the advantages of mild condition, safety and broad substrate scope, which afford a unique method for the synthesis of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds with a tertiary carbon center.

         <title>A Biomimetic Stereoselective Approach to Euolutchuol C and Its Structural Assignment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stereoselective total synthesis of euolutchuol C is demonstrated using a biomimetic cationic polyene cyclization, and its absolute structure is established. Four potential stereoisomers of euolutchuol C were synthesized to confirm the structure as an aromatic abietane diterpenoid consisting of a 15(S)&#8208;stereogenic center. Asymmetric Sharpless dihydroxylation was employed to build the chiral epoxide, while CBS&#8208;reduction was utilized to obtain enantiomerically pure benzylic alcohols. A convergent approach is used to synthesize euolutchuol C in seven longest linear steps resulting in an overall yield of 23&#8201;%.

         <title>Direct Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones through (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Thioketones and Acetylenedicarboxylic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones are a hitherto very poorly studied class of sulfur heterocycles some of which have been shown to be important precursors for HIV drugs or bioactive, anticarcinogenic compounds. We have developed a novel and effective process for the direct generation of this structural motif in a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The cycloadducts were obtained with complete regioselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield. The heterocyclic motif was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel protocol for the direct synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxathiolan&#8208;5&#8208;ones based on the (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between thioketones and acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The products were obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction within short reaction times and in typically very good yields. The product structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Benzyl Alcohols to N&#8208;Protected Anilines and Alkyl Alcohols to Carbamoyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot, scalable procedures converting benzylic or aliphatic alcohols to various N&#8208;functionalized amines are reported in 38&#8208;83% overall yields. These multi&#8208;step conversions are relatively economic and involve the oxidative formation of acid chloride intermediates and the Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides. Notable aspects of economy include: (1) the use of a relatively green solvent (chlorobenzene) that tolerates both ionic and radical reactions, without the need for rigorously dry or O2&#8208;free conditions; (2) the use of minimal amounts of trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and green chlorinating agent to oxidize the alcohol starting materials and then transform the aldehyde intermediates to acid chlorides under photoirradiation for azide addition; (3) the efficient capture of isocyanate intermediates by alcohol or azide nucleophiles providing N&#8208;protected anilines or N&#8208;protected alkylamines, respectively, the latter of which was employed in the synthesis of an anti&#8208;dementia drug, memantine hydrochloride, over two purification steps.</dc:description>

A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reaction, using N&#8208;chlorophthalimide as electrophilic chlorine source, enabling the facile synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in one step from readily available terminal alkynes and azides is reported. This approach allowed complete control of regioselectivities with a broad substrate scope. Furthermore, a novel epoxidation was developed using 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;triazole as substrate, which could be further applied in various organic transformations.







Abstract
5&#8208;Halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important scaffolds in organic chemistry, but current click reactions cannot produce 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in a simple way.

Complete control of regioselectivities with a broad substrate scope was accomplished by this approach.

         <title>Access to Electron&#8208;Rich Dibenzofurans through NBu4OAc&#8208;Mediated Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;donating substituents. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base and ligand, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to dibenzofurans.







Abstract
Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;rich aryl rings. Forming the key intramolecular Ar&#8722;Ar bond using traditional cross&#8208;coupling is difficult. The C&#8722;H functionalisation (C&#8722;H activation) approach is, in principle, far more useful. However, we previously found that the well&#8208;established conditions, which promote C&#8722;H functionalisation through Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation (CMD), proved unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base, ligand and solvent, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to electron&#8208;rich dibenzofurans.

         <title>Distinct Heterocyclic Moieties Govern the Selectivity of Thiophene&#8208;Vinylene&#8208;Based Ligands towards A&#946; or Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tau be or not tau be. A variety of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;vinylene&#8208;based ligands was synthesized. Ligands with specific chemical composition displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology and distinct heterocyclic moieties governed the selectivity of the ligand towards A&#946; or tau pathology. We foresee that these findings will aid in designing ligands towards disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Distinct aggregated proteins are correlated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases and the development of ligands that selectively detect these pathological hallmarks is vital. Recently, the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based optical ligands, denoted bi&#8208;thiophene&#8208;vinyl&#8208;benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), that could be utilized for selective assignment of tau pathology in brain tissue with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, was reported.

&lt;p&gt;Tau be or not tau be. A variety of fluorescent thiophene-vinylene-based ligands was synthesized. Ligands with specific chemical composition displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology and distinct heterocyclic moieties governed the selectivity of the ligand towards A&#946; or tau pathology. We foresee that these findings will aid in designing ligands towards disease-associated protein aggregates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinct aggregated proteins are correlated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases and the development of ligands that selectively detect these pathological hallmarks is vital. Recently, the synthesis of thiophene-based optical ligands, denoted bi-thiophene-vinyl-benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), that could be utilized for selective assignment of tau pathology in brain tissue with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, was reported. Herein, we investigate the ability of these ligands to selectively distinguish tau deposits from aggregated amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;), the second AD associated pathological hallmark, when replacing the terminal thiophene moiety with other heterocyclic motifs. The selectivity for tau pathology was reduced when introducing specific heterocyclic motifs, verifying that specific molecular interactions between the ligands and the aggregates are necessary for selective detection of tau deposits. In addition, ligands having certain heterocyclic moieties attached to the central thiophene-vinylene building block displayed selectivity to aggregated A&#946; pathology. Our findings provide chemical insights for the development of ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of different proteins and might also aid in creating novel agents for clinical imaging of tau pathology in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2&#8208;(o&#8208;Tolyl) Pyridine as Ligand Improves the Efficiency in Ketone Directed ortho&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we explore how adding a catalytic amount of an NC&#8208;type ligand improves ketone&#8208;directed ortho C&#8722;H arylation, whereas a full equivalent shuts down the transformation. Increased catalytic activity stems from the formation of a cyclometallated complex containing the NC&#8208;type ligand to provide an intermediate which accelerates the ortho&#8208;arylation of the ketone substrate.







Abstract
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ketone directed ortho&#8208;arylation wherein the addition of a bidentate NC&#8208;type ligand, most effectively 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine, significantly enhances the C&#8722;H arylation reaction. Various aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones, including cyclic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ones, are competent substrates, and arylboronic acid esters were used as aryl sources. However, substitution with OMe and CF3 in the aromatic ring of the ketone substrates is not tolerated, while such residues on the benzoic ester are possible. Notably, this study provides valuable insights into ketone&#8208;directed ortho arylation in the presence of 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine and adds additional options for catalyst and ligand optimization in ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have described an efficient protocol for the photoinduced defluorocarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrene using formate as the CO2 radical anion precursor, which successfully yields a wide variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinylacetic acids with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient protocol in which formate is used as a precursor of the CO2 radical anion for the photoinduced defluorocarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrene. A wide range of gem&#8208;difluorovinylacetic acids bearing a variety of functional groups were successfully obtained in the absence of metal catalysts. The synthetic value of this protocol was highlighted by successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification for complex biologically active molecules. This protocol provides a complementary method that extends the range of currently available methodologies for accessing the structurally versatile gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes.

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron&#8208;donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied. In this study, a well&#8208;defined NHO ligated&#8208;Pd catalyst was developed. N&#8208;substituents on NHO ligand affected the catalytic performance, and the addition of a phosphine co&#8208;ligand, in particular [2&#8208;(MeO)C6H4]3P was effective to enhance the activity.

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron&#8208;donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied. In this study, we synthesized 2&#8208;methyleneimidazolidine ligands equipped with a bicyclic frameworks with the goal of developing a NHO&#8208;ligated Pd catalyst. These synthesized [(NHO)PdCl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)]2 complexes had a phosphine co&#8208;ligand that proved effective as a catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling at ambient temperature. By optimizing the N&#8208;substituents of NHO ligands and a phosphine co&#8208;ligand, we developed a [(NHO)Pd{[2&#8208;(CH3O)C6H4]3P}Cl2] complex as a catalyst that shows good catalytic activity.

To expand the chemical space of chiral N&#8208;oxides and chiral furan&#8208;containing ligands, herein we designed and synthesized a new class of rigid&#8208;featured tertiary amine&#8208;derived C2&#8208;symmetric chiral furan&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide (Fu&#8208;2NO) ligands from optically pure l&#8208;prolinamides/hydroxylprolinamides in operationally simple two steps and up to 57&#8201;% overall yield. The newly developed rigid&#8208;featured chiral Fu&#8208;2NO ligands possesses two pyrroloimidazolone&#8208;based N&#8208;oxides as non&#8208;flat chiral walls, and afforded the opportunity for fine&#8208;tuning the ligand electronic and conformational properties by judicious choice of the substituent in the nonligating nitrogen atom. More importantly, The Fu&#8208;2NO ligands can tolerate air and moisture such that no special handling is needed for their storage, and can be applied in the Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction of indole.

Utilizing the nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, enantiospecific total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1&#8901;HCl and (+)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1&#8901;HCl were achieved. The key reactions were highly stereo&#8208; and regioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation with rhodium(II) acetate and regioselective ring opening of nitrogen&#8208;substituted D&#8722;A cyclopropanes.

A concise and efficient enantiospecific total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 and (+)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 was achieved from commercially available starting material L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid and D&#8208;glutamic acid, respectively. For the synthesis of this trihydroxylated pyrrolizidine ring, we employed the nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane as a key intermediate. The synthetic approach relies on two crucial steps, highly stereo&#8208; and regioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation with Rh2(OAc)4 and regioselective ring opening of a nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane.

         <title>An Unexpected Synthesis of Crowded Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene dioxide with two equivalents of tetracyclone yields a heptaphenyl triphenylene, presumably by double Diels&#8208;Alder addition followed by fragmentation and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.







Abstract
In attempts to make octaphenyldibenzofuran (7) and octaphenyldibenzothiophene (8), 2,5&#8208;dibromofuran (4) and 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene (5), respectively, were heated with tetracyclone (2) under forcing conditions, but only single addition products, such as 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzofuran (10) and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5,6,7&#8208;tetraphenylbenzothiophene (12) were observed. However, when 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide (6) was heated with tetracyclone, the chief product was 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyltriphenylene (14). Similarly, when compound 6 was heated with acecyclone (15), the product was 11,18,20&#8208;triphenyldiacenaphtho[a,h]triphenylene (16). Both 14 and 16 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. They are proposed to form from double Diels&#8208;Alder addition products of the cyclopentadienones by extrusion of sulfur dioxide and rearrangement of the resulting radicals.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation Total Synthesis of the Pigment Aurantricholone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously, 6,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;ketoketals&#8221;) gained by ring&#8208;closing metatheses (&#8220;RCMs&#8221;) gave 6&#8208;hydroxybenzocyclohepten&#8208;5&#8208;ones (&#8220;benzotropolones&#8221;) by hydrolyses with 10&#8197;equiv. of hot TsOH. Now, an RCM&#8208;based ketoketal allowed to reach the benzotropolone aurantricholone by total synthesis for the second time and to avoid a forcing hydrolysis. Another key to success was establishing the pulvinone(&#8722;like) motifs by our recently developed Suzuki strategy.







Abstract
Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring&#8208;enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8208; step 9 overall &#8208; engaged this motif in a &#946;&#8208;elimination of ROH rather than in a hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O&#8208;methyl 4&#8208;methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O&#8208;methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et&#8197;al. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr3/CH2Cl2 (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 co&#8208;crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Axially Iodobenzocarbazole Derivatives by Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III)&#8208;Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Iodoarylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct protocol for the facile construction of axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives via the catalytic asymmetric iodocyclization of indole moiety linked alkynes, using stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex as the catalyst, has been developed. A range of versatile axially chiral iodobenzocarbazoles were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% ee under mild conditions.







Abstract
A new synthetic approach to novel axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives based on the highly enantioselective intramolecular iodoarylation of linked alkyne&#8208;indole systems was developed by using the versatile chiral catalyst, stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;complex, through an axially chiral iodinated vinylidene o&#8208;quinone methide (IVQM) intermediate. This protocol provides 21 examples in excellent yields with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield, 98&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, the introduced iodine atoms can easily be converted into other functional groups.

         <title>Formal Radical Deoxyfluorination of Oxalate&#8208;Activated Alcohols Triggered by the Selectfluor&#8208;DMAP Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex</title>

In this work, a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols is reported.







Abstract
We present a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols. The method relies on the spontaneous generation of the N&#8208;(chloromethyl)triethylenediamine radical dication, a potent single electron oxidant, from Selectfluor and 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine. The protocol is easily scalable and provides the desired fluorinated products within only a few minutes reaction time.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful method to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available materials. In this review, the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes covering mainly contributions over the past decade are summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities in this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most powerful and straightforward methods to forge a new C&#8722;H bond and a new C&#8722;X (X=C, N, O, F, Si etc) bond, which provides an efficient way to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available feedstocks. Catalytic asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of simple alkenes is challenging but still highly sought after. This review will mainly focus on the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes over the past decade, including hydroamination, hydrooxygenation, hydrofluorination, hydrosilylation, hydroarylation, hydroalkenylation and hydrocarbonylation.

         <title>Radical Dearomatising Spirocyclisation of Benzisoxazole&#8208;Tethered Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of densely functionalised spirocyclic products through a radical dearomative spirocyclisation chain mechanism is described. The spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step ring expansion sequence.







Abstract
The dearomative spirocyclisation of benzisoxazoles through a radical chain mechanism is described. Densely functionalised spirocycles were prepared in high yields by reacting benzisoxazole&#8208;tethered ynones with aryl thiols in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. The identification of stabilising three&#8208;electron interactions was key to the development of this new radical cascade reaction. The obtained spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step hydrogenolysis&#8208;cyclisation sequence.

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;regioselective (2+4) cycloaddition of propargylic esters with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl substituted secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) was established, which afforded a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles in high yields (up to 99 % yield). This reaction represents the first &#945;,&#946;&#8208;regioselective (2+n) cycloaddition of propargylic esters via the intermediates of copper&#8722;allenylidenes, which will enrich the chemistry of propargylic esters and copper&#8722;allenylidenes. Moreover, this work also represents the first application of o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl substituted SPOs as 1,4&#8208;dinucleophiles in (2+4) cycloadditions, which provides a useful protocol for the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles with potential bioactivity.</dc:description>
