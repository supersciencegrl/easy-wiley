         <title>Total Syntheses of the Imidazo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridine&#8208;Containing Alkaloid Zephycandidine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally distinctive imidazo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridine&#8208;containing alkaloid zephycandidine A has been prepared by total synthesis for the first time using, inter alia, two&#8208;fold cross&#8208;coupling protocols for the assembly of the central six&#8208;membered ring. Biological evaluation of the alkaloid, a co&#8208;produced regio&#8208;isomer and various precursors reveal that some exert notable anti&#8208;viral effects.







Abstract
Two distinct and concise syntheses of zephycandidine A (1) from readily available starting materials are reported. In the first, the imidazole derived from piperonal (7&#8201;a) was subjected to reaction with o&#8208;bromoiodobenzene or the corresponding di&#8208;iodide in the presence of Pd[0] and thereby forming, via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig and Heck reactions, a mixture of target 1 and regio&#8208;isomer 10. These products could only be separated from one another by HPLC. A lower yielding but completely regioselective synthesis of zephycandidine A (1) was achieved by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of the imidazole, 6&#8201;b, derived from the bromopiperonal 7&#8201;b with o&#8208;iodophenylboronic acid (5&#8201;d). Preliminary biological screening of compounds 1, 10 and certain precursors reveal that some possess anti&#8208;viral properties but, contrary to expectations, are not notable inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.

This study describes the synthesis of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole from a novel Diels&#8208;Alder reaction active benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The resulting molecule formed a 2D&#8208;hexagonal array in crystalline state.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and optical properties of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole, 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,8&#8208;benzobenzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]dipyrrole, which was synthesized via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a novel benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The compound formed a 2D nested hexagonal array with NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystalline state; whereas, in the solution state, it exhibited through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced emission in the solution state.

         <title>Study of [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes Obtained by Post&#8208;Synthetic Aminolysis of a Kinetically Stable Carbonate&#8208;Containing Pseudorotaxane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes the straightforward access to a stable though activated carbonate&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane building block and its respective post&#8208;synthetic conversions into either [2]rotaxane and palindromic [3]rotaxane.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and study of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that contain an ammonium as the best molecular station and carbamate moieties as secondary molecular stations. The common post&#8208;interlocking synthesis relies on the aminolysis of the N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate extremity of an activated though insulated pseudorotaxane. The N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate&#8208;based thread's extremity proved to be small enough to allow the slow slippage of the DB24C8 around the thread and large enough to allow insulation of the kinetically stable pseudorotaxane. Due to its sensitivity towards amine compounds, the activated carbonate end of the encircled thread allowed post&#8208;interlocking aminolysis&#8208;based conversion into mechanically interlocked rotaxanes by providing the same way the carbamate secondary station for the DB24C8 in the thread backbone. Translation of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle between the two molecular stations was investigated.

         <title>Preorganized Homochiral Pyrrole&#8208;Based Receptors that Display Enantioselective Anion Binding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of tris(pyrrolamide) receptors for anion recognition is presented. The receptors were able to bind to a variety of anions with good affinity, and homochiral receptors produced a 1.6&#8208;fold greater affinity for (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate over (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate, demonstrating the ability to differentiate between these enantiomeric anions.







Abstract
Herein, a new scaffold for anion recognition based on a tripodal tris(pyrrolamide) motif is presented. The receptors were able to bind to a variety of anions with high affinity. Using density functional theory methods, the three&#8208;dimensional geometry of the receptor&#8208;anion complex was calculated. These calculations show that the receptors bind anions via a preorganized cavity of amide and pyrrole hydrogen bond donor groups. Based on these findings, homochiral tris(pyrrolamide) receptors were prepared, which produced 1.6&#8208;fold greater affinity for (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate over (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate, demonstrating the ability to differentiate between these enantiomeric anions. The interaction of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate and (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate within the homochiral receptor was examined by solution NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. These findings indicate that the preorganized positioning of the pyrrole groups and subsequent sterics allows to differentiate between the stereoisomeric anions.

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation/selective&#8208;benzoylation sequence for the synthesis of orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on SnCl 2 &#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with a 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed. Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208; O &#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Boryl Migration Enables Efficient Access to Versatile Functionalized Boronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of organoboronates is highly valuable in synthetic chemistry, material science and medicinal chemistry. In this Review, recent advances to access this privileged scaffold via 1,2&#8208;boryl migration are discussed. Two complementary methods by ionic or radical mechanism have been systematically introduced.







Abstract
Organoboronates are synthetically useful and highly valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Two&#8208;electron reactions allow for the rapid construction of organoboronates via nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;boron shift of boron ate complexes or MIDA&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;boryl migration. Radical approaches through 1,2&#8208;boron shift of neutral boronic esters or boron ate complexes have been demonstrated to be feasible, providing complementary methods to access these privileged scaffolds. In this Review, recent achievements are highlighted and future opportunities are discussed, with an emphasis on different operative modes of catalysis and reaction pathways.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Proving Syntheses of the Polyenoyltetramic Acids Pyranonigrin J and I</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first syntheses of the polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3; N&#8208;unsubstituted) and I (4; N&#8208;methylated) from the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18, the stannane 13, and the serine&#8208;based building block (S)&#8208;19 or the N&#8208;Me analog (S)&#8208;21, respectively. The specific rotations of our targets and their natural counterparts matched. This supports the absolute configurations of compounds&#8197;3 and 4 as previously inferred from the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labelled (S)&#8208;serine during biosynthesis.







Abstract
The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and pyranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their origins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S&#8208;configurations of their stereocenter had been deduced from expression experiments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after executing the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had essentially the same specific rotations as their natural counterparts. Our syntheses used the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18 as a conjunctive reagent. It was combined with the l&#8208;serine derivatives (S)&#8208;19 or (S)&#8208;21 (&#8220;Western building blocks&#8221;), respectively, through aminolyses. Stille couplings with the stannane 13 (&#8220;Eastern building block&#8221;) followed. The resulting &#946;&#8208;ketoamides (S)&#8208;11 and (S)&#8208;12 underwent desilylative Lacey&#8208;Dieckmann cyclizations when exposed to 8&#8197;equiv. of Bu4NF. They rendered the polyenoyltetramic acids (S)&#8208;26 [acidolysis: &#8594;&#8201;(S)&#8208;3] and (S)&#8208;4, respectively.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Homophthalic Esters: A New Type of Reagents for the Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally new reagent space has been discovered for the Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman reaction. Cyclic anhydride has been successfully replaced with CDI&#8208;activated monoesters of homophthalic acid allowing direct preparation of tetrahydroisoquinolonic esters. Mechanistic studies suggested a new reaction pathway not involving any previously described alkoxyisocoumarines.







Abstract
The reactivity pattern of the Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman reaction between homophthalic anhydride and imines was completely reproduced by replacing homophthalic anhydride with o&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)methyl benzoic acids activated by CDI (1,1&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole). This allows obtaining tetrahydroisoquinolonic esters directly and plants the Castagnoli&#8208;Cushman chemistry onto a fundamentally new reagent space not requiring the use of cyclic anhydrides.

         <dc:description>Enantioenriched, highly functionalized cyclopropane derivatives were prepared by a simple and green approach using monosaccharide&#8208;based chiral crown ethers as phase transfer catalysts. The Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure (MIRC) reactions of diethyl bromomalonate with 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;phenylacrylate took place with complete diastereoselectivity in the presence of chiral lariat ethers derived from carbohydrates and enantioselectivity up to 87% ee was achieved. Among the catalysts tested, the monoaza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 lariat ether having a methyl &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;glucopyranoside unit and a 2&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl group on the nitrogen generated the highest asymmetric induction (87% ee).

         <title>The Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of C3&#8208;Unprotected Indoles under Mild and Clean Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indoles are selectively N&#8208;allylated according to a salt&#8208;free nickel catalyzed reaction with allylic alcohols as co&#8208;reagents. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.







Abstract
A simple salt free and selective N&#8208;allylation of indoles with allylic alcohols has been developed. The protocol uses a catalytic amount of a nickel complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ni(cod)2 and dppf as diphosphine. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Aryl Iodides and Glycal Enones: Application in the Preparation of Dapagliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with enones derived from glycals in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under ligand&#8208;free conditions. The developed methodology was successfully applied in the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitor).







Abstract
An efficient approach for the preparation of C&#8208;1 aryl enones from aryl iodides and glycal enones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions under ligand&#8208;free conditions was developed. A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with galactal, glucal and rhamnal enones in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under mild conditions. The protecting groups, including benzyl, acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl groups, were found to be compatible under standard reaction conditions. The developed methodology was applied for the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitors). Regioselective nitration of C&#8208;1 aryl enones provides C&#8208;2 nitro aryl enones in good yields.

         <title>Selectfluor Mediated Difunctionalization of Olefins towards the Synthesis of Fluoromethylated Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Selectfluor&#8208;mediated synthesis of monofluoromethylated morpholines has been developed via the oxyfluorination of N&#8208;allylated aminoalcohols. This olefin difunctionalization strategy provides an access to a new chemical space utilizing readily available starting materials, exhibits good functional group compatibility, and can be performed on a gram scale.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxyfluorination of olefins with concomitant cyclization has been developed as a route towards monofluoromethylated morpholines. Selectfluor was employed as a fluorinating reagent as well as an oxidant to activate olefins. This strategy provides access to a new chemical space using aminoalcohol derived nitrogen&#8208;tethered alkene precursors.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Chlorination of Isoxazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric chlorination of isoxazolinones is reported. A planar chiral ferrocene based palladacycle managed to catalyze this reaction type with high enantioselectivity providing high to excellent yields. The chlorination products are useful substrates for SN2 type reactions as is demonstrated with NaN3. This was key for the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;azido &#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivative.







Abstract
Organic compounds featuring a chlorine substituted stereocenter are frequently found in nature and are interesting for pharmaceutical applications and as synthetic building blocks. Catalytic methods to generate such stereocenters by C,H bond functionalization are still relatively rare. Here we report the first catalytic asymmetric chlorination of isoxazolinones, a synthetically and biologically interesting class of heterocycles, which can be considered as precursors for &#946;&#8208;aminoacids. The title reaction was catalyzed with high enantioselectivity by a planar chiral ferrocene based palladacycle in high to excellent yields. It is showcased that the products are valuable for post&#8208;synthetic transformations. An SN2 reaction proceeded with smooth inversion of the absolute configuration. The substitution product could then be transformed into an &#945;&#8208;azido &#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivative via a reductive, diastereoselective ring opening.

The chlorination products are useful substrates for S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 type reactions as is demonstrated with NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This was key for the synthesis of an &#945;-azido &#946;-aminoacid derivative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic compounds featuring a chlorine substituted stereocenter are frequently found in nature and are interesting for pharmaceutical applications and as synthetic building blocks. Catalytic methods to generate such stereocenters by C,H bond functionalization are still relatively rare. Here we report the first catalytic asymmetric chlorination of isoxazolinones, a synthetically and biologically interesting class of heterocycles, which can be considered as precursors for &#946;-aminoacids. The title reaction was catalyzed with high enantioselectivity by a planar chiral ferrocene based palladacycle in high to excellent yields. It is showcased that the products are valuable for post-synthetic transformations. An S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction proceeded with smooth inversion of the absolute configuration. The substitution product could then be transformed into an &#945;-azido &#946;-aminoacid derivative via a reductive, diastereoselective ring opening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azoliums and Ag(I)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Thioglycosides: Synthesis, Reactivity and Bioactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Migita cross coupling and mechanosynthesis, a series of azoliums and Ag(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene thioglycoside complexes were synthesized. This new family of carbohydrate derived NHCs displays promising potential as catalysts as well as bioactive compounds.







Abstract
A versatile protocol for the synthesis of azolium thioglycosides is reported. This protocol is based on a PdG3&#8208;catalyzed Migita cross&#8208;coupling between p&#8208;di&#8208;iodo azoliums and protected or unprotected &#946;&#8208;1&#8208;thioglucose partners. Moreover, a solvent&#8208;free mechanochemistry approach was developed as a unique access to the corresponding Ag(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene thioglycosides. Finally, chemical reactivity and antiproliferative bioactivity were examined with azoliums and Ag(I)&#8208;NHC thioglycosides. This study demonstrates a promising potential of these newly synthesized carbohydrate&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives.

During a synthetic study targeting 3,5&#8208;dithio&#8208;glucofuranose, two interesting intramolecular displacement reactions that both generated the 3,6&#8208;thiaanhydro structures were discovered. We successfully solved the intramolecular displacement problem by using a 5&#8208;S,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group and synthesized the 3,5&#8208;dithio&#8208;glucofuranose in overall 9&#8201;% yields after 14 steps.

         <title>An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the combination of DABCO and acetic acid under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction rate of both activated and non&#8208;activated aldehydes increased significantly. The disclosed procedure is operationally simple and is compatible with a wide array of both nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction has been stablished as an important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transformation between carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and activated olefins. However, the slow reaction rate usually observed with electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners hinders a more widespread use of this reaction. In order to overcome this drawback, the effects of several Br&#248;nsted acids on the rate of DABCO&#8208;catalyzed MBH reactions were evaluated. The protocol is operationally simple, involving neat and open&#8208;flask conditions, and is compatible with a wide range of reagents. We suggest a general acid catalysis mechanism to be responsible for the rate increase. The synthetic versatility of the MBH adducts is exemplified with a two&#8208;steps diastereoselective synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;sitophilure. We hope this acid&#8208;mediated protocol to have potential use as a general methodology for the MBH reaction.

         <title>Insights into the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 3&#8208;Allyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diynes for the Synthesis of Bicyclic Hydrocarbons</title>

         <dc:description>
Unexpected rearrangements are observed in the gold&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of 3&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diynes. Depending on the fourth substituent either bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, cyclohexadienes, or 5,9&#8208;methanobenzo[8]annulenes are obtained from the presumably first&#8208;formed cyclohexenylidene gold intermediate.







Abstract
An efficient protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenes through a gold&#8208;catalyzed enyne cyclization was established in this work. Depending on the specific substitution pattern, unusual cationic rearrangements of the corresponding gold carbene were revealed, leading to either cyclohexadienes or 5,9&#8208;methanobenzo[8]annulene derivatives, respectively.

Depending on the specific substitution pattern, unusual cationic rearrangements of the corresponding gold carbene were revealed, leading to either cyclohexadienes or 5,9-methanobenzo[8]annulene derivatives, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 9, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates the effect of acetic acid on the rate of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction. The use of acetic acid as a fuel (additive) increases the reaction rate in all tested cases, with special emphasis on electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners. We believe that a general acid catalysis mechanism is responsible for this increase in reaction rate. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. W. Amarante, F. Coelho et&#8197;al.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a simple protocol for the synthesis of (  E  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;aminoacrylonitriles via Cu(OAc)  2  &#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition of secondary amines to 1,2,3&#8208;triazine  1  and an aerobic oxidation reaction. The reactions, which were studied with a broad substrate scope, are effective with cyclic, heterocyclic, aliphatic, allylic and benzylic amines as well as L&#8208;proline derivatives. The reactions use catalytic Cu(OAc)  2  to promote 1,2,3&#8208;triazine addition with various secondary amines, followed by in situ loss of nitrogen and subsequent imine oxidation to generate the corresponding (  E  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;aminoacrylonitriles in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. These copper(II)&#8208;mediated aerobic oxidation reactions proceed under mild reaction conditions by oxidation of the Cu(II) species using molecular oxygen to complete the cycle without the participation of ligand, base or chemical oxidant additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple Functionalization of a Tetraphenylethylene Aromatic Scaffold with Ynamides or Tetracyanobutadienes: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ynamides are useful and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis, from which 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes (TCBD) can be prepared for application in molecular electronics. However, their insertion onto multi&#8208;functional molecular scaffold remains a synthetic challenge. In this work, we report the two&#8208;steps synthesis in good isolated yield (64% overall, 89% stepwise) of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bearing four ynamides, and its further one&#8208;step conversion into the tetra&#8208;TCBD derivative through a [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization sequence. The concomitant formation of the four ynamides required a specific optimisation of the reaction conditions. Although a poor fluorescent emitter in solution, the tetra&#8208;TCBD compound displayed near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state which is an attractive optoelectronic feature when considering future applications in molecular electronic devices  .</dc:description>

         <title>Bilateral Aromatic Extension of Corannulene Nucleus</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores bilateral aromatic extension of the corannulene nucleus through a combination of Heck and Mallory reactions.







Abstract
Herein we show that a dibromo imide derivative of corannulene could be subjected to a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction in order to install aryl vinylene groups in a bilateral fashion on the C5&#8208;symmetric aromatic nucleus. A photochemically&#8208;induced oxidative cyclization then affords &#960;&#8208;extended structures in isolated overall yields of 35&#8211;44&#8201;%. Due to the aromatic area extension and the presence of electron withdrawing groups, the synthesized molecules exhibit an anodic shift of &#8776;1&#8197;V in their first reduction potential as compared to pristine corannulene. The bilateral growth of the aromatic scaffold, therefore, represents a viable strategy to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with an electron deficient character.

         <title>Black Swan in Phase Transfer Catalysis: Influence of Mixing Mode on the Stereoselectivity of Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of mixing mode on the outcome of the glycosylation under phase transfer conditions (batch vs flow) is found to be more complicated than it is generally assumed. A change in the way reagents are mixed leads not only to the enhanced mass transfer and consequently higher yield but also to a change in reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Phase transfer catalysis (PTC) is widely used for the preparation of anomerically pure aryl glycosides by glycosylation of phenols with glycosyl halides. Here, we attempted to synthesize 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenyl (CPP) sialoside &#8211; a useful Janus glycoside for neoglycoconjugate synthesis. A batch glycosylation reaction under typical PTC conditions (N&#8208;acetylsialyl chloride, 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenol, Bu4NHSO4, AcOEt, 10&#8201;% aq Na2CO3) resulted in formation of CPP sialoside as a single anomer, albeit in low yield. Conversely, the PTC glycosylation in flow using Comet X&#8208;01 micromixer doubled the yield of CPP sialoside, which was obtained as a mixture of anomers suggesting the change in the reaction mechanism apparently induced by the change in mixing mode. An increase in flow rate led to further loss of stereoselectivity while the use of T&#8208;shaped mixer increased stereoselectivity. Similar results were obtained for N,N&#8208;diacetylsialyl chloride and two other para&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;substituted phenols suggesting generality of the discovered phenomenon.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone by Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants Obviating a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis Thereafter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;closing metatheses (RCM) afforded benzocycloheptadienones. Their carbonyl groups were neighbored not by 2&#215;OMe, as in our original approach, but by OMe+SPh, by 2&#215;Cl or by 1&#215;OtBu, 1&#215;SPh or 1&#215;SO2Ph. Any of these changes allowed to proceed to 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone without invoking a Br&#248;nsted acid, let alone the hours of exposure to hot TsOH/MeCN required for processing the compound substituted by 2&#215;OMe.







Abstract
A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;styrene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosubstituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl+OMe (in 14&#8201;a), 2&#215;Cl (in 14&#8201;b), OtBu (in 17&#8201;a), SPh (in 17&#8201;b) or SO2Ph (in 17&#8201;c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused nona&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7&#8201;a&#8211;b and 9&#8201;a&#8211;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing metatheses provided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8&#8201;a&#8208;b and 10&#8201;a&#8211;c. Their ketone moieties were &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted (in 8&#8201;a&#8211;b) or &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted (in 10&#8201;a&#8211;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxyenone motif of the corresponding benzocycloheptatrienone&#8212;or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone&#8212;6&#8201;a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;containing benzocycloheptadienone 8&#8201;a gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone methyl ether (15) by sulfoxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethylated with BCl3. The same intermediate resulted from the dichlorobenzocycloheptadienone 8&#8201;b and NaOMe. The benzocycloheptadienone 10&#8201;a was de(tert&#8208;butylated) with formic acid; a subsequent Pfitzner&#8208;Moffatt oxidation completed 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a) once more. The PhS&#8208;containing benzocycloheptadienone 10&#8201;b was &#945;&#8208;acetoxylated with Pb(OAc)4; the resulting O,S&#8208;acetal gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a) by hydrolysis. The PhSO2&#8208;containing substrate 10&#8201;c was deprotonated whereupon an oxidation with Me3Si&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;SiMe3 gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a).

         <title>Smart photochromic materials triggered with visible light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches reversibly convert the energy of light into a variety of structural changes at the molecular level. They can be integrated into smart materials with broad range of applicability. While most photochromic systems require UV light for activation, application of photoswitches operational entirely within the visible or NIR range of light brings considerable benefits, such as biocompatibility, better light penetration through the material, propelling with sunlight, or a possibility to design dual systems that are mutually activated with UV or visible light frequencies for two distinct functions. In this minireview, we discuss the most relevant classes of molecular photoswitches, and demonstrate a selection of photochromic polymers, gels, porous materials, surfaces, energy&#8208;storing materials and other systems triggered with visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Mechanosynthesis of Biologically Active Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry contributes to the sustainable preparation of molecules in many areas of chemistry. This Review focuses on the mechanosynthesis of known APIs and biologically evaluated new entities (medicinal mechanochemistry), mostly heterocycles, metal complexes, and peptides.







Abstract
Synthetic mechanochemistry, the use of mechanical force produced by milling, grinding or extruding, as an activation technique, provides access to chemical entities of all kinds. This Review is focused on examples reported so far of known Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and effectively evaluated bioactive molecules, all prepared by mechanosynthesis. Three families of molecules are discussed: heterocyclic compounds, metal complexes and peptides. Advantages of the mechanochemistry approach are highlighted especially from a green chemistry and efficacy point of view.

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Teraryl&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics, Part&#8197;3: Iodophenyltriflate Core Fragments Featuring Side Chains of Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of iodophenyltriflate compounds decorated with the side chains of the proteinogenic amino acids Arg, Asn, Asp, Met, Trp and Tyr is reported. These fragments the set of building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based alpha&#8208;helix mimetics through sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using a benzene core unit featuring two leaving groups of differentiated reactivity in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling used for teraryl assembly. In previous publications we have introduced the methodology of 4&#8208;iodophenyltriflates decorated with the side chains of some of the proteinogenic amino acids. We herein report the core fragments corresponding to the previously missing amino acids Arg, Asn, Asp, Met, Trp and Tyr. Therefore, our set now encompasses all relevant amino acid analogues with the exception of His. In order to be compatible with the triflate moiety, some of the nucleophilic side chains had to be provided in a protected form to serve as stable building blocks. Additionally, cross&#8208;coupling procedures for the assembly of teraryls were investigated.

         <title>Investigations into Supramolecular Lyotropic Liquid Crystals Based on 1,3,5&#8208;Benzenetricarboxaramides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of deuterated chloroform and n&#8208;alkylaniline substituted 1,3,5&#8208;benzentricarboxamides are demonstrated to possess lyotropic liquid crystalline properties. Using NMR spectroscopy, the self&#8208;assembly behaviour within the constituting homologous series is investigated and effects of the sidechains aromatic ring and aliphatic chain on supramolecular behaviour characterized.







Abstract
New supramolecular lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) based on 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) with n&#8208;alkylaniline sidechains are described. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigate the effects of different chain lengths along the homologous series and of non&#8208;BTA additives on liquid crystalline behaviour. From this, we attempt to answer two questions: First, how aliphatic chain length and the addition of further aromatic rings affect the self&#8208;assembly process in general and compared to previously reported systems with purely aliphatic sidechains. Second, whether these modifications are suitable to increases the resulting LLC phases&#8217; resilience against disrupting effects of further, non&#8208;BTA additives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 5&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;pyridine boronic acid pinacol esters decorated with the side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant in protein&#8208;protein interactions is reported. This work completes our efforts towards a library of building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics via sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using pyridine containing boronic acid building blocks to increase the water solubility. Following our initial publication in which we have introduced the methodology in combination with sequential Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for teraryl assembly, we can now report a complete set of pyridine based boronic acid building blocks decorated with side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant for PPI (Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, Val) to complement the core fragment set. For a representative set of teraryls we have studied the influence of the pyridine rings on the solubility of the assembled oligoarenes.

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Teraryl&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics, Part&#8197;4: Core Fragments with Two Halide Leaving Groups Featuring Side Chains of Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of para&#8208;bromoiodoarene compounds decorated with the side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids is reported. These fragments serve as building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics via sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling. Compared to our established iodotriflate approach, the new building blocks showed higher stability and better reactivity under cross&#8208;coupling conditions.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using a benzene core unit featuring two halide leaving groups of differentiated reactivity in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling used for teraryl assembly. The use of para&#8208;bromo iodoarene core fragments resolved the issue of hydrolysis during cross&#8208;coupling that was observed when using triflate as a leaving group. We report a complete set of para&#8208;bromoiodoarene core fragments decorated with side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant for PPI (Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr and Val). In order to be compatible with general cross&#8208;coupling conditions, some of the nucleophilic side chains had to be provided in a protected form to serve as stable building blocks.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transport devices.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended peri&#8208;Acenes: Recent Progress in Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
peri&#8208;Acenes represent an important class of materials for organic (opto)electronic and spintronic devices. This Review provides a summary of the recent progress in the precision synthesis and characterization of peri&#8208;acenes and their &#960;&#8208;extended systems via on&#8208;surface or wet chemistry as well as the outlooks in this research field.







Abstract
Nanographenes (NGs) with open&#8208;shell character have gained intense attention due to their potential applications in future organic nanoelectronics and spintronics. Among them, NGs bearing a pair of parallel zigzag edges, such as acenes and peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) bestow unique (opto)electronic and magnetic properties owing to their localized non&#8208;bonding &#960;&#8208;state. However, their reactive zigzag edges impart intrinsic instability, leading to the challenging synthesis. The recent development of synthetic strategies provided access to several &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which were considered unrealistic for decades. Notably, their laterally &#960;&#8208;extended structures of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons was realised via on&#8208;surface synthesis. However, synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs in solution is still in its infancy, more intensive scientific efforts are needed to surpass the existing challenges regarding stability and solubility. This Review provides an overview of recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of PAs through a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy, including on&#8208;surface and solution&#8208;phase chemistry. In addition, views on existing challenges and the future prospects are also provided.

         <title>Chasing Polycyclic Natural Products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;Carbotricyclic Scaffold Construction via Stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Chiral Hydrindanes and Their Boron Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindanones with cyclic and acyclic dienes was examined. By choosing acidic or thermal conditions, the diastereoselectivity on the newly formed ring could be controlled and was rationalized by high&#8208;level computations. Additionally, boron complexation of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety exhibited unexpected selectivity in the cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chiral trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas thermal conditions provided the endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 into BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave endo/exo&#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;reactions with furan gave furyl&#8208;substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.

         <dc:description>The iridium catalysed N&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and amides using alcohols via hydrogen borrowing has been developed. The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines, and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;I Selective Sonogashira and Heck Coupling Reactions Catalyzed by Aromatic Triangular Tri&#8208;palladium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic triangular tri&#8208;palladium cations  1  &#8208;  3  , abbreviated as [Pd  3  ]  +  , have shown interesting photoelectric properties, Lewis basic characters and excellent activities in catalytic hydrogenation. Herein, we report the highly efficient and C&#8208;I selective Sonogashira and Heck coupling reactions catalyzed by these tri&#8208;palladium complexes. Benefit from the moderate C&#8208;I bond association energy, these tri&#8208;palladiums presented exclusive reactivities to aryl iodides over the brominated aromatics in coupling reactions.  In the Sonogashira pathway, mild to great isolated yields (71&#8208;95%) were achieved.  Gram&#8208;scale reaction reached 93% of yield with palladium loading down to 0.06 mol %.  We also explored the electronic and steric effects for phenyl alkynes and aryl iodides including heteroaromatics like thiophenes, pyridine, pyrazole, and pyrazine. Similarly, 71&#8208;96% of yields were obtained for palladium loading (1.5 mol%) catalyzed Heck coupling of aryl iodides and alkenes. The HRMS monitoring revealed that [Pd  3  ]  +  maintained as whole entity during the catalytic process due to their robust stabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Asymmetric Ir&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of Amino Acid Esters: Improved Selectivities through Structural Variation of the Chiral Phosphoramidite Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric N&#8208;allylation of tert&#8208;butyl glycinate using a racemic 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;alkyl methyl carbonate revealed severe limitations of existing protocols. By screening a set of 24 BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoramidites a new superior ligand (L24*) was identified which afforded the amination product with high enantioselectivity (&#8805; 95% ee) under optimized conditions. This ligand also allowed the N&#8208;allylation of other amino acid tert&#8208;butyl esters (derived from alanine, phenylalanine, or proline) with outstanding levels of stereocontrol (d.r. &#8805; 99 :1) and negligible matched/mismatched differences.</dc:description>

         <title>Energetic and Topological Supramolecular Study and Nucleation Mechanism Proposal of Halogenated Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, an energetic and topological supramolecular study of 10 different halogenated phenols, X&#8722;C  6  H  4  &#8722;OH (X = F, Cl, Br and I) in the ortho, meta and para positions was carried out, except for X = Br, in orto and meta&#8208;X&#8208;phenols. Most compounds have a molecular coordination number (MCN) of fourteen. All intermolecular interactions were classified and the robustness was evaluated. Strong intermolecular interactions such as O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contributed half the energy of the cluster, although interactions considered weak as C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;X and C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; reached 40% in energetic contribution, as they revealed a greater number of occurrences. Additionally, these theoretical data of energy were correlated with experimental data of melting point and packing density revealing a notable trend. In almost all cases evaluating the same position, the higher the density, the higher the melting point and the higher the stabilizing energy. Finally, nucleation proposals were suggested for all compounds and revealed that six compounds needed three stages, while four compounds needed only two stages to promote the growth of the supramolecular structure in three directions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise and Safe Synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;Propanetriamine (PTA)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Propanetriamine (PTA) is the simplest aliphatic vicinal triamine, a key compound in coordination chemistry and for the preparation of polymers and for many other important applications. Despite its simple structure and its sesquicentennial history, the preparations of PTA have always been elaborate, hazardous, and low yielding. In this article a concise, safe and inexpensive synthesis of PTA is presented. PTA is prepared by a nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction between dibenzylamine, nitromethane and paraformaldehyde, followed by a catalytic reduction&#8208;debenzylation with Pearlman&#8217;s catalyst leading to the desired triamine in 73% yield over two steps. The procedure is amenable for larger&#8208;scale preparations.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Antibiotic Properties of Amino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatic Terpenoids Related to Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additional amino&#8208;alkyl side chain makes the difference: A series of amino&#8208;functionalized analogs of marine diterpenoids were prepared by stereoselective total synthesis and characterized with respect to their antibiotic properties. While the phenolic intermediates showed activity only against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, the amines proved to be active also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains.







Abstract
Following a concept recently introduced by Hergenrother,[6] the present study addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic (marine) natural products can be converted into more potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. To this end, phenolic mono&#8208; and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7&#8208;hydroxycalamene) as well as the diterpenes 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A were converted into amino&#8208;functionalized analogs that display either an amino&#8208;methyl or a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;ethoxy substituent in place of (or next to) the OH group. This was achieved either by Pd&#8208;catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O&#8208;alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile and subsequent reduction, or by ortho&#8208;hydroxymethylation/amination. During the study, an efficient enantioselective total synthesis of 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene (8 steps, 29&#8201;% overall yield) and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A (9 steps, 30&#8201;% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation (91&#8201;% ee) of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene as the chirogenic step. Other important C&#8722;C bond forming steps include a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling and diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization reactions. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and subsequently tested for their antibacterial properties. Some of the diterpene&#8208;derived amines showed high efficacy, not only against Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC=0.5 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/ml), but also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (E. coli K12; E. coli I&#8208;11276b; MIC=8 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/ml). This clearly supported the underlying working hypothesis.

&lt;p&gt;An additional amino-alkyl side chain makes the difference: A series of amino-functionalized analogs of marine diterpenoids were prepared by stereoselective total synthesis and characterized with respect to their antibiotic properties. While the phenolic intermediates showed activity only against Gram-positive bacteria, the amines proved to be active also against Gram-negative bacterial strains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a concept recently introduced by &lt;i&gt;Hergenrother&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; the present study addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic (marine) natural products can be converted into more potent broad-spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. To this end, phenolic mono- and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7-hydroxycalamene) as well as the diterpenes 7-hydroxyerogorgiaene and 9-deoxypseudopterosin A were converted into amino-functionalized analogs that display either an amino-methyl or a 2-amino-ethoxy substituent in place of (or next to) the OH group. This was achieved either by Pd-catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile and subsequent reduction, or by &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxymethylation/amination. During the study, an efficient enantioselective total synthesis of 7-hydroxyerogorgiaene (8 steps, 29&#8201;% overall yield) and 9-deoxypseudopterosin A (9 steps, 30&#8201;% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric cobalt-catalyzed hydrovinylation (91&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) of 3-methoxy-4-methyl-styrene as the chirogenic step. Other important C&#8722;C bond forming steps include a Pd-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;Suzuki&lt;/i&gt; cross-coupling and diastereoselective &lt;i&gt;Lewis&lt;/i&gt; acid-mediated cyclization reactions. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and subsequently tested for their antibacterial properties. Some of the diterpene-derived amines showed high efficacy, not only against Gram-positive (&lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; SG511&lt;i&gt;, S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; HG003&lt;i&gt;, B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; 168; MIC=0.5 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/ml), but also against Gram-negative bacterial strains (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K12; &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; I-11276b; MIC=8 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/ml).

         <title>Bisubstrate Strategies to Target Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases (MTases) use the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) to transfer a methyl group to a diverse set of biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, small molecules). These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of many biological processes. In this Review, for each type of MTase, synthetic bisubstrate inhibitors designed as substrate analogs covalently linked to a SAM analog are presented.







Abstract
Bisubstrate strategies address the lack of specificity encountered with S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues targeting methyltransferases (MTases). Specifically, a bisubstrate inhibitor mimics the transition state complex associating a substrate and the SAM methyl group donor to a particular methyltransferase. These potential inhibitors contain both parts of the substrate and the methyl group donor. In this review, bisubstrate inhibitors of several MTases including DNA, RNA, protein, catechol or nicotinamide MTases are discussed in order to evaluate the interest of these promising molecules for the development of selective therapeutics against cancers, neuropsychiatric disorders and viral infections.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Borane in Solution: Application to a STING Agonist</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Equilibrium constants were determined for ligand exchange reactions of borane complexes with various oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus nucleophiles in solution, and a binding affinity scale was built spanning a range of 12 orders of magnitude. While the K eq are minimally dependent on the solvent, the rate of ligand exchange varies significantly. The fastest and slowest rates were observed in THF and CDCl  3  , respectively. Moreover, the ligand exchange rate differs in a very broad range depending on stability of the starting complex. Binding of BH  3  was found to be much more sensitive to steric factors than protonation. Comparing nitrogen bases having equal steric properties, a linear correlation of BH  3  binding affinity vs. Br&#248;nsted acidity was found. This correlation can be used to quickly estimate the BH  3  binding affinity of a substrate if p K a is known. Kinetic studies suggest the ligand exchange to occur as a bimolecular S N 2 reaction unless other nucleophilic species were present in the reaction mixture.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S  N  Ar) and epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions represent two fundamental synthetic transformations.

The selective formation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro,&#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones is described by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were also performed.







Abstract
Alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;propargyl phthalimides were used as valuable building blocks for the selective formation of the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The key factors addressing the product selectivity control were determined. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were tested. Reaction mechanisms of the different reaction pathways are assumed.

         <dc:description>Benzo[c]chromones are valuable tricyclic systems of natural and biological significance. Herein, we report a concise approach of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes in a two&#8208;step sequence starting from ortho&#8208;bromo benzylic alcohols and arylboronic acids, using intermolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and intramolecular N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated key C&#8722;O bonds construction. Besides, the current method explored broad substrate scope under robust conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro indoline&#8208;3, 4&#8217;&#8208;pyran and fused epoxyetheno indeno [1,2&#8208;  b  ] furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded through the Knoevenagel, Michael adduct via intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro indoline&#8208;3,4&#8217;&#8208;Pyran and epoxyetheno indeno [1,2&#8208;  b  ] furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium(II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the recent developments of dual catalysis in rhodium (II) carbenoid chemistry, where rhodium is cooperatively working with a second transition metal (Sc/Pd/Ag/Au) or organocatalyst. The redox compatibility, turnover pathways, and the generation of unique rhodium&#8208;bound zwitterionic intermediates make rhodium an attractive partner for dual catalysis reactions to enable new transformations.







Abstract
Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.

         <title>Manufacturing Approaches of New Halogenated Agrochemicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the latest generation of halogen&#8208;containing agrochemicals introduced into the market over the past 10&#8197;years is provided. Manufacturing approaches of current halogen&#8208;containing development candidates are described.







Abstract
To ensure sustainability, the agrochemical industry is faced with enormous challenges, from provision of high&#8208;quality food to water use, environmental impact and growing world population. The loss of agrochemicals due to consumer perception, changing grower needs and everchanging regulatory requirements is higher than the number of active ingredients being introduced into the market. Therefore, the development of new agrochemicals is essential, that can provide improved efficacy and favorable environmental profiles. In this context, introduction of halogen atoms into a molecule is an important tool to influence its physico&#8208;chemical properties. Since 2010, around 81&#8201;% of the launched agrochemicals contain halogen atoms. This Review gives an overview of the latest generation of halogen&#8208;containing agrochemicals introduced into the market over the past 10&#8197;years and describes manufacturing approaches of current halogen&#8208;containing development candidates.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Featuring a Porphyrin Scaffold: Synthesis, Optical and Biological Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrafunctionalized zinc porphyrin with coumarin is able to accumulate on cell membrane by targeting selectively membrane&#8208;bound tumour&#8208;associated CA IX/CAXII, to impair pancreas cancer cell proliferation and to kill them by photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and study of optical properties of innovative tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrins with carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in sulfonamide and coumarin series are described. The synthetic methodology relies on the preparation of the porphyrin core by condensation of azido triethyleneglycol functionalized benzaldehyde derivative with pyrrole followed by its metalation and inhibitors coupling via Huisgen click&#8208;reaction. The tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrin with coumarin moieties showed selective inhibition against tumour&#8208;associated hCA IX and hCA XII versus the cytosolic off&#8208;targets hCA I and hCA II. This compound was able to accumulate on cell membrane and to impair pancreas cancer cells (Capan&#8208;1) proliferation in normoxic conditions with LC50 of 4.5&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, its optical properties revealed efficient photosensitizing properties, leading to cancer cells death under light irradiation, making this compound a suitable candidate for photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;based Cryptands with Rarely Strong Affinities for Binding Neutral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the syntheses of two new crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based cryptands and their complexation behaviors with neutral organic molecules. The interactions between  4  /  5  and  G1  /  G2  were fast exchange systems forming pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. The association constant (  K  a  ) of "long&#8208;armed" cryptand  5  with  G2  was even up to 2.5&#215;10  5  M  &#8208;1  , which is 10 to 10  3  times higher than the previously reported host&#8208;neutral guest system to the best of our knowledge. Such a large  K  a  is even comparable to that of reported cryptands with secondary ammonium salts and paraquat derivatives. Thorough studies demonstrated that excellent spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (H&#8208;bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) are essential for such a large  K  a  .</dc:description>

         <title>KOtBu/DMSO Catalytic System for Isomerization of Allylic Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isomerization of allylic alcohols is an important reaction because it can afford carbonyl compounds in an atom&#8208;economical manner. Although base&#8208;catalyzed methods are more desirable than those using transition&#8208;metal catalysts from both the economic and environmental points of view, these methods have several drawbacks, such as narrow substrate scope and high catalyst loading. This paper reports the development of an efficient KOtBu/DMSO catalytic system suitable for the isomerization of a broad range of allylic alcohols with good yields, to which previously reported systems could not be applied. This catalytic system was successfully applied to a tandem allylic isomerization/electrophilic trapping reaction, thereby highlighting its synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Magnoshinin and (+)&#8208;Merrilliaquinone: Application of a Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Functionalization Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization using DDQ and subsequent chemoselective oxidative demethylation enables the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone.







Abstract
A unified approach for the first enantioselective total synthesis of magnoshinin and merrilliaquinone is reported. The key feature of the synthesis is the DDQ assisted chemoselective late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization of the polyoxygenated chiral tetralin core accessed by utilizing the relayed asymmetric induction strategy. Then, the follow&#8208;up of chemoselective redox chemistry facilitates the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin (28.2&#8201;% overall yield) and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone (20.6&#8201;% overall yield) along the shortest route, starting from the known 3&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8722;NHC Compounds (NHC=N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow syntheses of thiourea and selenourea N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based derivatives are reported. The use of homogeneous and heterogeneous weak base flow setups allows for unprecedent short reaction times (2&#8211;5&#8197;min) under mild conditions using green solvents.







Abstract
The first continuous flow syntheses of sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8722;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) adducts in unprecedented short reaction times and high yields are reported. The importance of these species in coordination chemistry or as efficient tools for determining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of NHC ligands make any improvement in their synthesis a worthy goal. Thiourea derivatives bearing both saturated and unsaturated NHCs were obtained using NEt3 as a weak base (homogeneous setup) in conjunction with a bed of elemental sulfur (S8). The synthetic route proving optimal for selenoureas involves the use of a simple Se/K2CO3 heterogeneous microreactor design.

         <title>XtalFluor&#8208;E effects the C3&#8208;H sulfenylation of indoles to form di&#8208;indole sulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, regioselective synthesis of di&#8208;indole sulfides by electrophilic aromatic substitution of the C3&#8208;position of indoles was achieved using Xtalfluor&#8208;E as the sulfenylating reagent. The addition of amine bases was found to have a significant effect on the reaction outcome, with 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU) switching off the reactivity of XtalFluor&#8208;E, while the hindered base 2,6&#8208;ditertbutyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridine (DBP) led to the formation of two di&#8208;indole&#8208;sulfur containing products, one S(II) and one S(IV). The optimal base for accessing the di&#8208;indole sulfides in high yield proved to be H&#252;nigs base, EtNi  Pr2  . While this amine formed a Lewis adduct with XtalFluor&#8208;E, adduct formation did not completely quench electrophilic reactivity indicating reversible coordination to the sulfur centre. This is the first report utilising XtalFluor&#8208;E in electrophilic aromatic substitution to form C&#8208;S bonds to our knowledge, and this process is applicable to a wide range of functionalised indoles and does not require N1&#8208;protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroallylation of Vinylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing readily available vinylsilanes as the latent nucleophiles to asymmetrically couple with allylic phosphates through CuH catalysis has been successfully developed under very mild reaction conditions. Consequently, a range of optically active organosilanes were synthesized with general good yields with up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroallylation of readily available vinylsilanes with allylic phosphates in the presence of hydrosilane was developed. These transformations can be performed under mild reaction conditions and provide the useful chiral organosilanes with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Silylation of Diarylmethyl Carbonates with Silylboranes under Base&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation reaction of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. By taking advantage of in&#8208;situ generated alkoxide ligand arising from the carbonate substrate, the reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions. The resulting benzyl silane moiety can undergo the post functionalizations to deliver the more complex diarylmethane derivatives. Additionally, the related base&#8208;free allylic silylation reaction is also demonstrated.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions, and the corresponding benzylic silanes are formed in good to high yields. The obtained benzyl silane derivatives can work as the benzylic nucleophiles by the action of a suitable fluoride source and react with some carbon electrophiles to deliver the corresponding benzylic C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupled products. Additionally, while still preliminary, the allylic silylation of the isoelectronic allylic carbonates is also achieved.

         <title>Generating Monofluoro&#8208;Substituted Amines and Amino Acids by the Interaction of Inexpensive KF and Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective ring&#8208;opening of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;sulfamidates with fluorine anion is reported. Construction of monofluoro&#8208;substituted amines and amino acid derivatives is realized by using inexpensive potassium fluoride (KF). The monofluorination process only needs 35&#8197;minutes under heating, which will be an attractive new route for the synthesis of the PET fluorine&#8208;18 radiotracer.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Nanographenes: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Naphtho[1,2&#8208;a]pyrenes**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed double alkyne benzannulation reaction onto a phenathrene moiety results in the rapid synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended [4]helicene hybrids. Substitution of the cove region results in increased inversion barriers and allows for separation and study of the enantiomers by circular dichroism.







Abstract
A mild and efficient synthesis of a broad scope of substituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;a]pyrene derivatives was accomplished in good yields using an InCl3/AgNTf2&#8208;mediated two&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation reaction. HPLC enantiomeric separation was achieved and the interconversion barriers have been determined. The ECD spectra of two derivatives were recorded and interpreted through TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Raman spectra were also recorded and predicted through DFT calculations.

         <title>Multi&#8208;catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols Containing a Tetrasubstituted Fluorinated Stereocenter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a multi&#8208;catalytic sequence, valuable enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols containing a challenging tetrasubstituted fluorinated stereocenter could easily be prepared. The sequence involves an organocatalyzed fluorination of disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed aldol reaction. From the aldol adduct, ketone reduction followed by enantioselective organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution provided the diols in &gt;90&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
The enantioselective construction of fluorohydrins featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter embedded in complex frameworks represents an important challenge. Herein, we report a multicatalytic strategy enabling the stereoselective preparation of a new type of scaffold containing such a challenging fluorohydrin motif. The sequence is based on an organocatalyzed fluorination of &#945;&#8208;disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction. Reduction of the generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone followed by a Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution enables the isolation of original fluorinated 1,3&#8208;diols with perfect diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control.

         <title>Accessing Medicinally Relevant O&#8208;Benzofused Heterocycles through C&#8722;X Activation: Recent Trends</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of heterocyclic scaffolds through C&#8722;X activation has thrived in recent years as an effective approach to access various structures for several purposes. In this Review, we cover the latest high&#8208;impacting work targeting benzofused O&#8208;heterocycles, highlighting the applicability of both palladium and copper catalysts for the C&#8722;X activation steps.







Abstract
In this Review, we address the recent advances in the elaboration of medicinally relevant oxygen benzofused heterocycles by palladium and copper catalyzed C&#8722;X activation of halo arene precursors. This attractive transformation has shown remarkable versatility and efficiency as a synthetic toolkit leading to the construction of numerous scaffolds with high structural diversity in an atom&#8208;economical manner. We covered recent examples that considered the application of this strategy using miscellaneous coupling partners and conditions. The haloarene motif has proven to be an exceptional candidate principally due to its availability and cost, and in this review, we showcase relevant and appropriate examples of its use in catalytic reactions leading to medicinally important targets.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Epimerization of d&#8208; into l&#8208;C&#8208;(Glycosyl)methanol Compounds Using 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of enantiomerically pure cis&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds, through a long&#8208;range epimerization at C5 of readily accessible d&#8208; or l&#8208;carbohydrates, by means of a remote reductive radical sequence was described. A comparative study of the radical process promoted by a tin reagent or with photoredox conditions was also performed. The stereochemical and polarity influence of the substituents in the course of the radical sequence was considered.







Abstract
A simple epimerization of C&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glyp)methanol into C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Glyp)methanol compounds is described. The radical sequence involved homolytic cleavage of the C5&#8722;H bond by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer promoted by the 1&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;yl radical and subsequent hydride addition with inversion of configuration.

In further development of this procedure compounds with C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf)&#8208; and C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;5dRibf)methanol structures have also been synthesized. The alkoxyl radicals were generated by reaction of the corresponding N&#8208;alkoxyphthalimides with nBu3SnH(D) and in comparative terms, by visible light&#8208;photocatalysis using the Hantzsch ester/fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 procedure. The influence of the sugar ring conformation and the electronegativity of the substituents on the stereochemical outcome will be addressed.

&lt;p&gt;The preparation of enantiomerically pure &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosyl compounds, through a long-range epimerization at C5 of readily accessible &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;- or &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-carbohydrates, by means of a remote reductive radical sequence was described. A comparative study of the radical process promoted by a tin reagent or with photoredox conditions was also performed. The stereochemical and polarity influence of the substituents in the course of the radical sequence was considered.

         <title>From Biomass to the Karrikins via Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Hemicellulose&#8208;Derived Butyl Xylosides and Glucosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective catalytic oxidation of monosaccharides was applied to butyl xylosides and butyl glucosides leading to the formation of bioactive karrikins, molecules that are important in the response to catastrophic fires. Butanosolv processing of biomass provides a co&#8208;product stream that contains these starting materials providing relevance to this work in the biorefinery context.







Abstract
Members of the karrikin family of bioactive small molecules are known to promote germination of a range of plants following large scale fires. As a result, they are relevant and interesting compounds. This report describes their synthesis from a biomass&#8208;derived product stream. During work to fractionate biomass with the goal of obtaining high quality lignins, an interesting co&#8208;product stream derived from the hemicellulose in the biomass, was obtained. Whilst many applications of this co&#8208;product stream can be proposed, in this case the major monosaccharides have been converted to relevant karrikins in short reaction sequences. Key results include a highly selective catalytic oxidation reaction, conversion of the resulting ketone to a butenolide by two alternative approaches, a selective acetal reductive opening reaction, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two compounds and detailed comparison of the final products with previous literature reports. Only through successful use of all the components generated during biomass refining, can economic sustainability be potentially achieved.

         <title>Synthetic Study of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural in Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of renewable 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural as the aldehyde component in the GBB multicomponent reaction was explored. Mild conditions and short reaction times were achieved to obtain new imidazoheterocycles with good selectivity. A small compound library based on the optimized conditions was built to exemplify the scope.







Abstract
In the present study, we explored the reactivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF), a renewable platform chemical, as the aldehyde component in the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) multicomponent reaction. Given the limited stability of 5&#8208;HMF under conventional conditions used for this reaction, acidic milieu in combination with high temperature or long reaction times, we explored factors which influence the course of the reaction (solvent, catalyst, time, and temperature) within the guidelines of previously reported green reaction conditions. Mild conditions and short reaction times were achieved to obtain good conversion and selectivity values. The reaction scope was exemplified by preparing a small compound library based on the optimized conditions varying the amidine and the isocyanide component. The hydroxymethylfuran moiety present in the GBB products, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles, provides useful functionalization for further transformations, which could expand the diversity of the chemical space.

Greener catalyst, greener solvent: Energy&#8208;transfer process enabled by an organocatalyst (4CzIPN) and using dimethylcarbonate as solvent offers a more sustainable alternative protocol for the formal enyne&#8208;metathesis of 1,7&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
A new approach to access 1,3&#8208;diene derived quinolinone compounds has been realized using a mild reaction protocol employing a metal free catalyst (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) (4CzIPN), blue LED as activation source, and benefits from a sustainable solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The mechanism is postulated as an amide&#8208;tethered enyne intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;photocatalyzed cycloaddition&#8208;retrocycloaddition sequence, proceeding via a cyclobutene intermediate species. The methodology offers an efficient route towards decorated 1,3&#8208;diene products.

         <title>Isoprostanoids, Isofuranoids and Isoketals &#8211; From Synthesis to Lipidomics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated fatty acid metabolites are known as isoprostanoids, isofuranoids and isoketals. These metabolites are formed under oxidative stress and have many biological roles (e.&#8201;g., biomarkers, bioactivity). This Review discusses the main chemical strategies for their synthesis as well as the analytical methods to quantify them in biological samples.







Abstract
A huge diversity of oxygenated metabolites originated from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had been discovered. Radical cascades are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites, and the radical initiation can be performed either inside the active site of an enzyme in the extracellular medium, or in membrane on phospholipids. The development of convergent and flexible chemical strategies to prepare these compounds by organic chemists, along with the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods, has boosted the knowledge regarding PUFA metabolites. Also, isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment. This Review provides a brief overview on the chemical strategies and analytical methods achieved over the past thirty years.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyranocyclopentaindolines Representing the Western Sections of Janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and Shearinine&#8197;G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of pyranocyclopentaindolines: Tetracycles representing the ABCD partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G were synthesized starting from indoline. The hydroxylated western section of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.

         <title>Acylation of Hexaphenylbenzene for the Synthesis of [5]Cumulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaphenylbenzene is appended to [5]cumulenes, a marriage of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;carbon building blocks for synthetic allotropes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of hexaphenylbenzene is reported, and the reaction favorably provides the monoacylated products 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b. The resulting ketones 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b are used as precursors for the formation of [5]cumulenes, including 6&#8201;b in which the sterically demanding HPB moiety affords a diethynyl[5]cumulene that features significant stability (persistence) versus the analog 6&#8201;c which lacks the HPB endgroups. The unsymmetrical substitution pattern of the two most soluble derivatives 6&#8201;b and 6&#8201;c, allows for estimation of rotational barriers for diethynyl[5]cumulenes via VT NMR studies of cis&#8208;trans isomerization. For both molecules, the barrier to rotation is ca. 15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is attenuated in comparison to other [5]cumulenes due to the presence of the ethynyl endgroups.

         <title>Silk&#8722;Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8722;fibroin&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) was successfully applied in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides. Structural investigation of Pd/SF by WAXS analysis, together with the help of a computational model, supported the hypothesis of catalytic pockets where monoatomic Pd species can form stable complexes with SF.







Abstract
Recently, we have reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15&#8197;&#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.

         <title>Manifestations of Antiaromaticity in Organic Materials: Case Studies of Cyclobutadiene, Borole, and Pentalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern synthetic strategies have enabled the proliferation of seemingly unstable antiaromatic species into several molecular and materials applications. These destabilizing moieties offer a unique way of tuning the electronic properties of organic materials. In this Review, the history, synthetic strategies, and applications of important conjugated building blocks based upon the antiaromatic cores of cyclobutadiene, borole and pentalene are explored.







Abstract
This Review surveys the experimental and synthetic history of three classic antiaromatic cores: cyclobutadiene, borole, and pentalene. The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials are discussed.

Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformation (CIDT) of a a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide is reported. This process provided an enantiopure stereolabile &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, which after diastereoselective carbonyl group reduction led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with excellent diastereoselectivities. These bromohydrins can be used as precursors for the synthesis of enantiopure 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl)piperidines. The utility of this methodology was illustrated by the diastereodivergent synthesis of hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine.







Abstract
Diastereodivergent syntheses of the enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine are reported. Our approach relies on efficient Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of an epimeric mixture of a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, that provided a stable &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, and diastereoselective &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide reduction that led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with high level of asymmetric induction.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade and Divergent Synthesis of Indolobenzazepines and Indoloquinolines from Nitrogen&#8208;Tethered 1,8&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade hydroamination and cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes proceeded by cationic Au(I) catalysts. The divergent synthesis of indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines and indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was achieved by the choice of phosphine ligands. The fluorescent aza[6]helicene could also be prepared by this protocol.







Abstract
We describe the divergent construction of two nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic systems by gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerizations. The gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade hydroamination and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes yielded indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines in one pot. In contrast, when Johnphos&#8208;coordinated gold catalyst was used, the same 1,8&#8208;diynes were transformed into indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization along with rearrangement of the substituent on one of the alkynes. The reaction of a naphthalene&#8208;tethered substrate provided a helically chiral aza[6]helicene.

         <title>Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidates as an Modular Conjugation Platform to Generate Multi&#8208;Functional Protein&#8208; and Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate building blocks were used for a chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row to facilitate a simple protocol for the construction of protein&#8208;protein conjugates and homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs). A third chemoselective modification step allows a highly modular assembly that yields homogeneous and precise Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugates (ADFCs).







Abstract
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidates allow for a simple chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row. We describe four such bis&#8208;electrophiles that carry different functional O&#8208;substituents with tunable hydrophilicity and enable further subsequent conjugations, thus facilitating a simple protocol for constructing protein&#8208;protein conjugates. An increased spacer length between the two ethynylphosphonamidates simplifies the formation of a conjugate from two bulky proteins. We apply these reagents to obtain homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs) from DM1 and trastuzumab with excellent cytotoxicity and selectivity for the targeted cell line. Moreover, a bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate, carrying an additional alkyne for a chemoselective triple conjugation, has been subjected to fluorescent labeling of an ADC specifically at the drug site give an Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugate (ADFC), allowing for the observation of intracellular trafficking after ADC uptake into the targeted cell.

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via side&#8208;chain anchoring of the ornithine &#948;&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides represent a popular class of macrocyclic drug candidates and therefore their solid phase synthesis has attracted much attention. In this contribution we present an efficient method of side&#8208;chain anchoring for ornithine and lysine residues to be used in the standard Fmoc&#8208;based synthesis of cyclic peptides via on&#8208;resin cyclization. We demonstrate that the side chain of ornithine and lysine protected with  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;group can efficiently be converted to the isocyanate which is then immobilized on Wang&#8208;type resin in almost quantitative yield. We further show the synthesis of four biologically active cyclic peptides employing the side chain ornithine anchoring. Our method is at least on a par with the previously reported methodologies in terms of yield and the purity of the final products and is arguably operationally more straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
