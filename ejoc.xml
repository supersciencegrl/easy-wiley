         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small series of chromophores with an increasing number of norbornadiene units was synthesized. Comparison of the reversible photoisomerization reaction to the corresponding quadricyclanes revealed an optimal balance of photochemical properties for the tris&#8208;norbornadiene derivative.







Abstract
The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been established that multifunctional photoswitches with several norbornadiene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the corresponding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex=315&#8197;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex=520&#8197;nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lives of 1 to 2&#8197;days. Moreover, the photochemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annulated pyridines and substituted indoles are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. These heterocyclic motifs are easily accessible from secondary propargyl alcohols and hydrazine derived enamines by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions. The bifunctional ruthenium catalyst used is stable to air and moisture and is easily accessible in high yield from commercially available compounds.







Abstract
New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.

         <title>S&#8208;Aryl Substitution Enhances Acidity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large series of novel N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts with 3&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substituents was prepared from neutral S&#8208;aryl triazole precursors. High protofugalities (kinetic acidities) were demonstrated for C(5)&#8208;H highlighting the acidifying effect of the distal C(3)&#8208;sulfur with mechanistic insight obtained from XRD&#8208;protofugality correlations.







Abstract
The 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre&#8208;catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity&#8208;enhancing effects of thio&#8208;substituents on carbon acidity are well&#8208;documented but not explored in the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)&#8208;H acidity. The direct attachment of S&#8208;aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (kDO) for C(5)&#8208;H deprotonation by DO&#8722; base that are 2.9&#8211;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium iodide in D2O solution. Protofugalities for the N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating N&#8208;alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre&#8208;catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substitution. Detailed X&#8208;ray structural data&#8208;protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the S&#8208;aryl substituent effect origins. C(5)&#8208;H pKa values (16.9&#8211;18.6) were calculated by utilisation of experimental protofugalities.

         <title>Elemental Sulfur Promoted Cyclization of o&#8208;Chloronitrobenzenes and Aryl Isothiocyanates to Furnish 2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles from substituted nitroarenes is rare. Elemental sulfur has now been found to promote the cyclization of 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates to give 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles with different useful functionalities in moderate to good yields. The method provides a convenient pathway to obtain these compounds, as the nitroarene precursors could be directly used without further reduction.







Abstract
Methods to afford 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles often involve the use of o&#8208;aminothiophenols or aniline&#8208;typed precursors. Herein we describe a method to furnish 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles through the cyclization of o&#8208;chloronitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates with the assistance of elemental sulfur. From the perspective of step economy, our strategy allows for the direct use of nitroarene precursors without further reduction to anilines. The scope of the reaction with respect to both substrates was investigated, and it was found that electronic properties of the aryl isothiocyanate was important for obtaining acceptable yields.

A binary mixture of organic salts, also known as ionic liquids, [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] denoted as BmIL1 has been explored as bifunctional catalyst for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions. The methodology has been extended to the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones via another pathway from different precursors under the same catalytic system. Greener synthesis of existing drugs reestablished the multifunctionality of BmIL1. Gram scale synthesis of both the products, DFT calculations and sc&#8208;XRD data add significance to the developed protocol. Moreover, high atom economy and eco score values justify the sustainability of the methodology.

         <title>Activation of Alkenes via Chalcogen Bond: Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bond Catalyzed the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 2&#8208;Vinylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates the stepwise mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;vinylindoles catalyzed by chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond. Furthermore, the activation of alkene through Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond serves as an alternative strategy to drive this reaction. The reaction catalyzed by Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonds involves the endo and exo pathways, and the endo product is more easily obtained.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond catalysis is a promising catalytic strategy, characterized by its environmental friendliness, relatively inexpensive cost, and similar reactivity to transition metal catalysis. Experimental results suggest that the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonds can efficiently drive the vinyl&#8208;indole&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9395&#8211;9400). In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;vinylindoles is investigated based on density functional theory. For this reaction, the Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis is as an alternative catalytic strategy. The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction catalyzed by chalcogen bond is stepwise and involves two steps: the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation process and the cyclization process. The cyclization process is the rate&#8208;determining step. From the perspective of energy decomposition analysis, the electrostatic interaction is the main factor to cause Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis, the polarization interaction is the main factor to cause Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis. Additionally, this catalytic reaction involves the endo pathway and exo pathway. The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.

         <title>Synthesis of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;Fluoro Analogues of Febrifugine and Halofuginone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Febrifugine and isofebrifugine have attracted interest from a structural and biological perspective. In this work, the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidine analogues of these natural products have been prepared following a five&#8208;step route featuring electrophilic enamine fluorination, Sakurai&#8208;type allylation and functional group manipulation of the 2&#8208;allyl substituent. In their free&#8208;base forms the interconversion of these diastereomers has been studied at different temperatures by NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The novel synthesis of racemic cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight&#8208;forward seven&#8208;step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination&#8208;allylation sequence that generates a mixture of N&#8208;Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation&#8208;methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the N&#8208;Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the cis&#8208;diastereomer favours a conformation where the F&#8208;atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its trans&#8208;stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2&#8208;substituent overrides any F&#8208;atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO&#8208;d6 and as their free&#8208;bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65&#8201;:&#8201;35 ratio of trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the trans&#8208;isomer was 94.3&#177;4.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, whereas for the cis&#8208;isomer it was 84.5&#177;3.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

Abstract
A novel and highly efficient method for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols has been established. Using an Earth&#8208;abundant and air&#8208;stable chromium salt catalyst and a phosphine&#8208;free ligand, the developed Cr&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling provides 1,3,5&#8208;triazines and pyrimidines with high yields and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the synthetic value of this operationally simple protocol was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiment and the synthesis of the linker to construct various supramolecular complexes.

         <title>Ambient Pressure Hydroformylation &#8211; A Key Step to Meso&#8208;Alkyl BODIPYs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient four&#8208;step, five reaction sequence has been developed for the synthesis of meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs on the basis of ambient pressure hydroformylation. The use of a CO/H2 balloon mounted on a Schlenk tube as well as MTBE as the solvent allows for an easier to reproduce and environmentally benign synthetic method. The synthesis of 23 derivatives in up to 67&#8201;% overall yield shows the applicability of the developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs is presented. In our previous work, the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes was used to generate an aldehyde from an alkene via rhodium catalysis and use them in a subsequent tandem reaction to obtain BODIPY dyes. However, the use of higher pressures and therefore autoclaves as well as their necessary equipment might limit others to use this method. The refined approach in this work employs ambient pressure hydroformylation, done in a simple Schlenk tube and using a CO/H2 balloon, as key step towards an easier meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPY synthesis. Additionally, the use of MTBE instead of chloroform as reaction solvent results in a greener approach. Readily available and easily synthesizable alkenes as well as different pyrrole building blocks can be used to extend the range of known alkyl&#8208;BODIPYs. The synthesis of 23 derivatives with overall yields of up to 67&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the refined method.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient four-step, five reaction sequence has been developed for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl BODIPYs on the basis of ambient pressure hydroformylation. The use of a CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; balloon mounted on a Schlenk tube as well as MTBE as the solvent allows for an easier to reproduce and environmentally benign synthetic method. The synthesis of 23 derivatives in up to 67&#8201;% overall yield shows the applicability of the developed method.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thione Based on [2+3] Annulation Trapping of &#945;&#8208;Keto Sulfine with Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction using &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines derived from arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. The method enables the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones in a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot process without catalysts, showcasing a new approach for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons through a tandem sequence of reactions.







Abstract
Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3+2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.

         <dc:description>
A catalytic system utilizing TMS&#8226;OTf has been developed for the purpose of selectively thiolating electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. Environment&#8208;friendly sulfur surrogates are employed for chalcogenation in this one&#8208;pot single strategy, which takes place under mild conditions and yields para&#8208;thio&#8208;substituted arenes and 3&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;indoles in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic system employing TMS&#8226;OTf for the regioselective thiolation of electron&#8208;rich arenes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been developed. The reaction occurs in a solvent mixture of dichloroethane and trifluoroethanol under mild conditions, with the addition of water. This method furnishes a range of para&#8208;thio&#8208;substituted arenes and 3&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;indoles in good to excellent yields, marking a significant advancement in organic synthesis.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transformations of N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a powerful tool for many annulations, X&#8722;H bond insertions or functionalizations under rhodium catalysis. The reaction of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with Rh(II) complexes gives rise to highly electrophilic &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium carbene intermediates that can be readily incorporated to construct various nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks. Considering the significant importance of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in synthetic chemistry, in this review, we have described Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformations of this valuable synthon since 2014.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8722;H or O/N/S&#8722;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy. In this review, we have described the transformations of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles based on &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium(II) carbene intermediates.

Amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} is used as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines with an excellent yield of corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions yielding the corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines after aqueous work. Solid amidophosphine boranes, which are easy to synthesize, and easy to handle demonstrated excellent reactivity and functional group tolerance toward a wide variety of ketones and imines, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substitutions, thus showing excellent chemoselectivity.

Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8208;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides.

         <title>Methanol&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot Transformation of Benzonitriles to Five and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles: Synthesis and Mechanistic Approach</title>

         <dc:description>
A green, one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free synthetic approach to 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, starting with benzonitriles and different available diamines and amino alcohols, within methanolic media. Detail mechanistic and theoretical studies support the dual role of methanol as solvent and as mediated agent.







Abstract
Herein we describe a facile methodology for the synthesis of heterocyclic molecules such as 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted imidazolines, oxazolines and 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrimidines, under one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free conditions. A series of electron&#8208;poor substituted benzonitriles were used as starting materials with different available diamines and amino alcohols, producing the desired products in good to high yields within methanol and in the absence of catalyst or additives. This methodology can be easily scaled up to laboratory size of 3&#8197;mmol for both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Detailed mechanistic and theoretical studies supported the dual role of methanolic media as solvent and as mediated agent. To shed light on the reaction mechanism, DFT mechanistic studies suggest a distinction in the first step, with the activation of the nitrile by methanol, and the formation of a benzimidamide and/or a benzimidate (observed by NMR) as intermediates. This facile synthetic procedure provides a green, metal&#8208;free, and mild protocol for the synthesis of a series of imidazoline, oxazoline and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 41, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;-amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2-elimination followed by sequential 1,2-addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2-addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;-amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent-free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent-free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The catalytic activity of a set of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Rh(I) and Ir(I) complexes featuring carbene&#8208;linker&#8208;carbene (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligands coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion was assessed in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of a series of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Ir(I) and Rh(I) complexes bearing the (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligand, coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion, was evaluated in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. The chelated mononuclear cationic complex [Ir(cod)(COC)]PF6 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; COC=biscarbene ether) displayed the highest reaction rate for 4&#8208;pentynoic acid to form &#947;&#8208;methyl&#8208;ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (5&#8208;methylenedihydrofuran&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one). Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination. Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4&#8208;pentynoic acid derivatives.

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 41, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zonisamide, an important anti&#8208;epileptic drug, was prepared with a new and convenient synthesis. This process involves the preparation of a key hydroxyiminosultone intermediate, whose stereochemistry was characterized by powder XRD, and a rearrangement reaction, whose mechanism was investigated with a combination of techniques (NMR, HRMS and kinetic profiles).







Abstract
Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31&#8201;% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.

         <title>[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions to Corannulene Accelerated by &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 41, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of Ru complexes to corannulene increases substantially its reactivity as a dienophile in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions because of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering effect. Lowering of the repulsive Pauli repulsion term is driven by the charge transfer from the corannulene to the metal moiety.







Abstract
The influence of different (LRu)nII (L=Cp&#8211; (n=1, 2); C6H6) moieties &#951;6&#8208;coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)+, (Benzene)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)+, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;position, as Michael acceptors.

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 41, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier&#8208;type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1&#8208;aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2&#8208;substitution (electron&#8208;withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1&#8208;aminoglycosides through this method.

This review provides a systematic overview of the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes from centrally chiral precursors via central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chiral conversion or transfer strategies. It covers a broad spectrum of reactions, including Fischer indolization, Povarov reaction, Michael reaction, [3+2] and [2+2+2] cycloadditions, showcasing the versatility of these approaches in constructing enantioenriched helicenes.







Abstract
Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis. In this review article, described between 2012 and 2024, the approaches for the synthesis of chiral helicenes by chirality conversion or transfer from centrally chiral precursors are summarized.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Lactams: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched seven&#8208;membered lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of biologically active compounds and drugs. Significant progress has been achieved in this domain more recently. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral seven&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

         <title>Polyphosphoric Acid Catalyzed C&#8722;H Dinitration of Passivated Aromatic Compounds with Potassium Nitrate under Mild Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatics has been developed, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as both solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the conventional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.







Abstract
Dinitroaromatics are valuable organic compounds. However, the high value of these compounds is accompanied by significant risks and formidable challenges. Herein, we report a safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatic compounds, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the traditional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.

         <title>Electrochemical Domino Sulfonylation/Dearomative ipso&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Biaryls to Access Spiro(indenyl)cyclohexadienones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, metal&#8208;free and external oxidant&#8208;free method is described for the synthesis of sulfonylated indenyl&#8208;spirocyclohexadienones under electrochemical conditions via radical&#8208;promoted ipso&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls.







Abstract
Herein, we present an efficient strategy for the synthesis of spiro(indenyl)cyclohexadienones through radical&#8208;promoted reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls with sodium sulfinates under electrochemical conditions. The reaction involves sulfonylation and dearomative ipso&#8208;cyclisation in a domino fashion. This approach features the use of readily accessible precursors, wide functional group tolerance and external oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions. The practicality of the method was also illustrated by scale&#8208;up reaction and further diversification of the product.

         <title>Strategy for C&#8722;H Functionalization of Cubanes: From Stoichiometric Reaction to Catalytic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, recent advancement in the strategy for C&#8722;H functionalization of cubanes is summarized. There are two main categories: directed ortho&#8208;metalation and radical functionalization. Both classical stoichiometric conditions, which cover most of the literature precedents, and catalytic methodologies, which are expected to open a new aspect of cubane chemistry, are described.







Abstract
We summarized a strategy for C&#8722;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field. Cubane, known as a bioisostere of benzene ring, and its functionalization hold significant potential for future drug development. However, owing to its highly strained and thermodynamically unstable nature, the methodologies are limited and their precise and diverse functionalization is challenging in current organic chemistry. In this Concept, we categorized and explained these methodologies, which represents a majority of current cubane C&#8722;H functionalization. In addition, we discussed recent advancements in catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization methods, demonstrating their potential to address these challenges effectively.

Abstract
Rapid and efficient construction of &#945;&#8208;haloketones with diazo compounds and amidine&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HX (X=Cl, Br, I) salts as halogen sources has been recognized as a simple and practical strategy. The reaction exhibits a broad scope and scalability, thereby enabling synthesis of a broad spectrum of functionally orchestrated &#945;&#8208;haloketones under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions in a short time. Control experiments established the involvement of triffate 10 in the mechanism.

         <dc:description>
5,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides react with enol diazoacetates producing rare annulated heterocycles: oxazinooxazines and oxazinoaziridine derivatives. A switch between reaction pathways is accomplished by the amount of catalyst Rh2(Oct)4 and the order of the addition of the substrates. Both transformations show a wide substrate scope, high yields, and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Reactions of 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides with enol diazoacetates were studied. A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates. Use of Rh2(Oct)4 (2&#8197;mol.%) leads to chemoselective [3+3]&#8208;annulation producing 1,2&#8208;oxazine&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives. With lower catalyst loadings (0.03&#8197;mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in&#8197;situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Catalyzed Cascade C&#8722;H Functionalization: An Atom&#8208;Economical Strategy to Access Diverse 2&#8208;Substituted Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward route to substituted benzothiazoles involving C&#8722;H functionalization at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions obviates the conventional use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors to make benzothiazoles. The method makes use of readily available and unfunctionalized materials to afford a diverse range of the target products, including the synthesis of active antitumor drug GW 610.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails one&#8208;pot cascade carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Br&#248;nsted acid and a ligand source at the in&#8197;situ generated I(III) center. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors. Mechanistic studies were carried out, and the synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated for the synthesis of the benzothiazole&#8208;based antitumor drug GW&#8208;610.

         <title>Acceptor End&#8208;functionalization of Naphthalenediimide Bithiophene Oligomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IC and RD end&#8208;functionalization of T2&#8208;(NDI&#8722;T2)n oligomers is achieved in two steps in high yields. Upon performing the Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of piperidine as base, tricyclic end groups form for n =2. Weak nucleophilic bases such as pyridine/Et3N prevent this side reaction. Optoelectrical properties and crystallinity of the acceptor&#8208;terminated oligomers are studied in detail.







Abstract
Oligomeric materials combine advantageous properties of both their small molecule and polymeric counterparts. Utilizing oligomers as non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been shown to be extremely useful for the development of organic solar cells with high efficiency, reproducible performance and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report on two series of synthetically simple acceptor&#8208;terminated oligomers A&#8722;T2&#8208;(NDI&#8722;T2)n&#8208;A with naphthalene diimide (NDI) and bithiophene (T2) cores up to the trimer (n =1,2,3). Termination of the oligomers is done using the strong acceptors (A) dicyanomethylene&#8208;indanone (IC) and rhodanine (RD). Upon acceptor termination in the presence of piperidine (pip) as base, oligomers with pip&#8208;substituted tricyclic end groups are obtained in high yield. We investigate the effect of oligomer length and acceptor end group on opto&#8208;electronic properties and crystallinity. Both IC&#8208; and RD&#8208;termination increase electron affinity compared to the parent, non&#8208;functionalized cores. UV&#8208;vis absorption in solution slightly redshifts as the chain length increases without showing a distinct aggregation. Asymmetric termination with hexylphenyl&#8208;substituted indacenodithiophene (IDT) and IC is also possible. All symmetric oligomers show a strong tendency for crystallization, with the oligomer having the tricyclic end group exhibiting the highest melting enthalpy and temperature. The asymmetric IDT&#8722;T2&#8208;NDI&#8722;T2&#8208;IC oligomer is amorphous.

Oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA), in which the adenine base (ethA) was fixed to syn conformation, were synthesized. The ethA:thymine base pair in the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick and parallel Hoogsteen duplexes could form two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds and two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds, respectively.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) were synthesized in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed in the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases through the syn conformation in DNA.

         <title>Photochemical Defluorinative Alkenylation of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes with Organoboronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a photochemical defluorinative alkenylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with organoboronic acids, providing a straightforward and efficient route for synthesizing functionalized gem&#8208;difluorinated 1,4&#8208;dienes. This defluorinative approach offers an easy way to convert readily available trifluoromethyl alkenes to valuable difluoroalkenes.







Abstract
We have developed a photo&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative two&#8208;component coupling reaction of trifluoromethyl alkenes and organoboronic acids, providing a straightforward and efficient route for the synthesis of functionalized gem&#8208;difluorinated 1,4&#8208;dienes. Both the chemical yields and functional group tolerance are generally good.

         <title>Benzofuroxan&#8208;Based Energetic Materials with Alternating Nitro and Hydroxyl Groups: Synthesis, Characterization, and Energetic Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported the synthesis of benzofuroxan&#8208;based energetic material, 5,7&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4,6&#8208;dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole 1&#8208;oxide (DHDNBF), with alternating nitro and hydroxyl groups. A substantial improvement in thermal stability and energetic performance is observed after the dicationic salt formation.







Abstract
Due to its good stability, density and oxygen balance, the benzofuroxan fused ring framework has attracted particular attention in the field of high energy density materials. The planar structure of the benzofuroxan facilitates the straightforward derivatization with explosophores and contributes to molecular stability. In this work, a benzofuroxan scaffold was utilized to develop a highly dense energetic material, namely 5,7&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4,6&#8208;dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole 1&#8208;oxide (DHDNBF). The successive inclusion of explosophores like nitro (&#8722;NO2) and oxidative functionality like hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) on benzofuroxan resulted in an impressive density (&#961;=1.91&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and a positive oxygen balance (6.20&#8201;%) in DHDNBF (2). Furthermore, the hydroxy groups on DHDNBF enable the formation of dicationic energetic salts 3&#8211;7, contributing to additional modifications in the overall performance. Energetic salts 3, 4, and 5 exhibit significantly higher densities ranging from 1.84 (5) to 1.87 (3)&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and possess a favorable oxygen balance approaching zero or equal to zero. A marked improvement in thermal stabilities was observed in all the energetic salts (3&#8211;7) compared to their neutral counterparts, DHDNBF. Energetic salts 4 (Dv=8459&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=32.10&#8197;GPa) and 5 (Dv=8539&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=30.37&#8197;GPa) possess good energetic performance, comparable to that of well&#8208;known explosives such as LLM&#8208;105 (Dv=8560&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=33.4&#8197;GPa). Overall, the favorable characteristics of energetic salts 4 and 5 make them potential candidates for use as benzofuroxan&#8208;based secondary and primary explosives, respectively, in various military and civilian applications.

         <title>A New CuI/Oxalamide Catalytic System for the Large&#8208;Scale Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial example illustrates the remarkable catalytic oxidation capacity of oxalamide/CuI in the oxidative field and its prospective applications. It demonstrates mild oxidizing power at room temperature under air (Example 53), with excellent selectivity towards primary alcohols and completed 100&#8197;mmol scale&#8208;up. In addition, the structural modification of bioactive molecule derivatives and the derivatization of drug molecules have also been successfully achieved.







Abstract
Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8722;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100&#8197;mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we report a metal and additive&#8208;free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N,3&#8208;diarylpropanamides via in&#8197;situ thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse a&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation&#8208;dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a metal and additive-free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;-ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2-sulfonyl-3-oxo-N,3-diarylpropanamides via &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8722;S cross-coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse a-sulfonyl-&#946;-ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation-dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Batch to Continuous Flow Visible&#8208;Light Photooxidations Using Alumina Supported Hydroxyanthraquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyanthraquinones, of synthetic or natural origin, display energy transfer properties and have interests in visible light mediated 1O2 photooxidations. The hydroxylic substitution pattern is key to induce high reactivity and enables immobilization on alumina particles with applications under batch and continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The discovery of new environmentally friendly recyclable photosensitizers is key to develop future applications in photooxidation chemistry. We report here the evaluation of a set of differently substituted biobased hydroxyanthraquinones in the context of visible light mediated singlet oxygen (1O2) photochemistry. This class of compounds is efficiently immobilized on alumina supports, which offers a simple way of removing them from the reaction mixture downstream. An integrated process using a flow reactor with a fixed catalytic bed is also evaluated and its performance is compared with homogeneous conditions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Vinylogous Allylic Alkylation between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Pyrazoleamides and MBH Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first vinylogous allylic alkylation reaction using &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides as the &#947;&#8208;nucleophile is developed. This synthetic approach is mild and effective with a broad substrate scope to achieve the construction of multifunctional chiral 1,5&#8208;diene compounds.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric vinylogous allylic alkylation is an efficient method to construct chiral 1,5&#8208;diene compounds. In this work, acyclic unsaturated amides are used as a nucleophile for enantioselective vinylogous allylic alkylation. With 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral tertiary amine C11, the enantioselective vinylogous allylic alkylation between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazoleamides and Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates is achieved, affording optically active multifunctional chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (74&#8211;99&#8201;%) with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities (67&#8211;94&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Synthesis of SulfoCy5&#8208; and SulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis of sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer as probes to unravel the mechanism of action of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates, such as antigen&#8208;&#945;GalCer synthetic vaccines, and to understand the fate of their components. Herein we present the synthesis and formulation in liposomes of sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer probes, followed by cellular uptake and confocal microscopy uptake experiment in a murine dendritic cell line.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8208;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8208;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8208;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Fluorocyclopropane &#946;&#8208;Lactams with Activity Against Mycobacteroides abscessus and Mycobacterium bovis BCG</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl &#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared. The most active compound displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39&#8197;mg/mL). The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger.







Abstract
A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2 &#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1&#8201;a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39&#8197;mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1&#8201;a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.

&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as &lt;i&gt;M. bovis&lt;/i&gt; BCG (MIC 0.39&#8197;mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; resulted in &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactam ring opening but only the more active mono-fluoro cyclopropane series &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Innovative Benzimidazole&#8208;fused Ionic Organoselenium Compounds: Prevalence of Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N/Se Chalcogen Bonds with the Selenocyanate Receptor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N or Se&#183;&#183;&#183;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8208;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8208;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8208;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N or Se&#183;&#183;&#183;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, electrostatic potential surface (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Radicals Generated from Aryl Pinacol Boronates Modify Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions&#160;and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages&#160;the&#160;versatile reactivity&#160;of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate&#160;(APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from&#160;the&#160;accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as&#160;biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens&#160;the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>La(OTf)3&#8208;Mediated [3+3]&#8208;Annulation of Benzoxepines and Aminocrotonates: Easy Access to Bridged Bicyclic Benzoxepine Heterocycles&#8224;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for bridged bicyclic benzoxepines from benzoxepines and aminocrotonates. Compounds were formed through [3+3]&#8208;annulation with new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds.







Abstract
A new and effective method for making bridged bicyclic benzoxepine derivatives were devised through the intermolecular [3+3]&#8208;annulation of benzoxepine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with aminocrotonates in the presence of La(OTf)3. The compounds were formed through reactions involving the benzoxepine moiety's C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5 carbons to produce C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. One of the compound structure (&#177;) 12&#8208;ethyl&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3,4,7&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;3,7&#8208;methano benzo[h][1,4]&#8208;oxazonine&#8208;6,12&#8208;dicarboxylate was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Transformations of Enamines: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamines, containing multi&#8208;reactive active sites, have received extensive attention and rapid development under the background of electrochemical renaissance in recent years. The review systematically summarizes recent electrochemical transformation of enamines and future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Enamines, containing nucleophilic amino groups and activated C=C bonds, are important building blocks, and widely used in the synthesis of heterocycles, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. In recent years, electrosynthesis has gradually developed into a powerful protocol for constructing chemical bonds due to its high economy, environmental friendliness, and mild reaction conditions. This review summarized the recent advances in the electrochemical transformation of enamines, including the construction of heterocyclic compounds, C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of enamines for synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes, and the functionalization reactions of enamines via C=C double bond cleavage. The reaction conditions and mechanisms were systematically discussed, and the challenges and future directions of this field were included in this review.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Forming Reactions of Vinyl Cations: A Personal Perspective</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl cations have emerged as promising building blocks for C&#8722;C bond forming reactions via aliphatic and aryl C&#8722;H insertion. These reactive intermediates may be catalytically generated by treating vinyl triflates with lithium or silylium ions paired with weakly coordinating anions. This article provides new observations and insights and aims to accelerate the reader's selection of optimal vinyl cation reaction conditions.







Abstract
Vinyl cations were first proposed as reactive intermediates nearly eighty years ago by Jacobs, and their properties were closely studied in the second half of the twentieth century by Stang, Olah, Caple, Grob, Hanack, and others. Recent developments in the catalytic generation and reactions of vinyl cations with unactivated C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds prompted us to assemble a field guide based on our previous experiences that is geared for synthetic chemists who are looking to construct C&#8722;C bonds via vinyl cation C&#8722;H insertion or Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition. In particular, this article focuses on silylium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;initiated C&#8722;C bond forming reactions of vinyl cations generated from vinyl triflates and ultimately aims to provide the reader with context and accelerate their selection of optimal reaction conditions and starting materials.

         <title>A Supramolecular Gel that Exhibits Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsiveness and High Conductivity through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of gel monomer was designed and synthesized, and a supramolecular conductive gel with excellent conductivity and multiple stimulus responsiveness was constructed through host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.

Tri&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;CF3&#8208;allenamides were readily synthesized from the reaction of &#946;&#8208;CF3&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynamides with secondary amides via a simple base mediated, highly regioselective 1,4&#8208;hydroamidation process.

         <title>Organoiodine Catalysed Intramolecular C&#8722;N Bond Oxidative Coupling for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Monosubstituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles via organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;N bond oxidative coupling reaction. Structurally diverse oxindole frameworks were rapidly obtained in good yields in complex oxidative systems. In this research, the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products.







Abstract
An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87&#8201;% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates to be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to M06&#8208;2X, wB97X&#8208;D, and B3LYP&#8208;D3 (but not B3LYP) predictions. The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin-4-ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates to be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid-catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non-covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side-chain conformers of O-silylated prolinol enamines, according to M06-2X, wB97X-D, and B3LYP-D3 (but not B3LYP) predictions. The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron-donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic material synthesized through the oxidative self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. This material emulates the adhesive properties of mussel foot proteins, allowing the formation of robust and stable organic coatings on various surfaces. Researchers have attempted to identify and improve the surface&#8208;coating properties of PDA by incorporating additional organic functional groups. This review explores the structural modifications of dopamine molecules at the organic chemistry level, with a focus on changes in the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, and examines their impact on the applications of PDA. The flexibility of these modifications underscores their importance for optimizing PDA coatings for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Product&#8208;like Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/Shikimic Acid Hybrid Analogues with Anti&#8208;osteoclastogenic Activity via Photo&#8208;Nazarov Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The first case of photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole with 91&#8201;% yield for (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;product was developed. And the protocol was employed for the synthesis of a series of natural product&#8208;like analogues with novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogs were proved potent anti&#8208;osteoclastogenic activity and promising pharmacological value.







Abstract
Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to construct novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited&#8208;state photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole. (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;products were afforded in moderate to good yields (37&#8211;92&#8201;%) for most of substrates (91&#8201;% for model substrate 1&#8201;aa) after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues (2&#8201;t, 3&#8201;c and 3&#8201;d) exhibited potent RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities (inhibitory rate &gt;50&#8201;% at 5&#8197;&#956;M), which suggested promising prospect of the novel tetracyclic indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti&#8208;osteoporosis drug development.

The synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8722;1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Benzoxazole and benzoxazolidine are constituents of various bioactive natural/synthetic molecules comprising benzenoid aromatic residue. However, non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffolds such as tropone and tropolone are also found in natural products. This report describes the synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8722;1.2&#8197;V. Hence, cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidinyl amino acids/peptides could be promising analogs of benzoxazolidine for the development of therapeutic drugs.

         <dc:description>Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3%.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate interference phenomena and con&#173;duc&#173;tance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thio&#173;phene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respect&#173;ively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridin&#173;yl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demon&#173;strated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corres&#173;ponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8208;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected through four&#160;meso&#160;carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four&#160;meso&#160;carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Trivalent Heteroglycoclusters as Focal Point Pseudoenantiomers: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of heteroglycocluster mirror images: Heterotrivalent cluster glycosides featuring three disctinct sugar ligands were prepared by the effective sequential glycosylation of a scaffold molecule incorporating an asymmetric focal point. Intermediate diastereomers were separated and one stereoisomer crystallized. The effect of relative glycoligand orientation was preliminarily assed in lectin binding assays.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of the first heteroglycoclusters featuring three distinct carbohydrate ligands. The obtained pair of stereoisomeric glycoclusters were named &#8220;focal point enantiomers&#8221;, as the configuration of the focal point is the only varying stereogenic element in these molecules. The first pair of such diastereomeric heteroglycoclusters was accessible by an efficient sequence of protection and sequential glycosylation steps utilizing a mannosyl, a N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyl, and a galactosyl donor, respectively, which was applied to a prototype azido&#8208;functionalized tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) scaffold molecule. The stereoisomers could be distinguished based on an X&#8208;ray structure of one of the isomeric key intermediates. As previously shown with divalent counterparts, such heterotrivalent cluster glycosides are useful tools for studying the fine&#8208;tuning of carbohydrate recognition. The azido functional group at the focal point of the synthetic scaffold molecule was employed in a conjugation reaction with a linker for further immobilization on a gold surface in order to fabricate glyco&#8208;SAMs (self&#8208;assembled monolayers). A preliminary biological evaluation of the focal point enantiomers was performed in solution using the well&#8208;known model lectin Concanavalin A and the important bacterial lectin FimH.

         <title>Roles of Divinylbenzene Co&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker in a Threefold Cross&#8208;Linked Polystyrene&#8211;Phosphine Hybrid Monolith: Impact of Cross&#8208;linking Degree on Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths was prepared to investigate the impact of the divinylbenzene co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker on coordination behavior and metal stabilization. By adjusting the cross&#8208;linking degree by varying the feed ratio of divinylbenzene, selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of the metal was achieved, facilitating the continuous&#8208;flow C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of chloroarenes.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow organic transformations using immobilized catalysts are crucial for green and sustainable chemistry. Cross&#8208;linked polymer ligands offer high stability, ease of recovery through filtration, and thus enhance performance in continuous&#8208;flow reactions via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Additionally, the cross&#8208;linking structure of the polymer support creates a unique reaction platform that controls the coordination behavior of the supported ligands and stabilizes the metal catalysts. However, insights into the material&#8208;based design for preparing highly active and durable immobilized metal catalysts are still limited. In this report, we propose a straightforward approach to boost both selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of metal complexes. We developed threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths with cross&#8208;linking structures adjusted by varying the content of divinylbenzene as co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker. The coordination behaviors and metal&#8208;support interactions of these monoliths were evaluated, highlighting the importance of co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker content in site&#8208;isolating phosphine units and stabilizing metal centers via arene&#8208;metal interactions on the polystyrene network. By optimizing the cross&#8208;linking structure, the monolith catalysts demonstrated exceptionally high catalytic activity and durability in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;Cl transformations, such as Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations in continuous flow. This underscores the utility of our monolith system in challenging transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Switching the Stereopreference of TeSADH: Enabling Anti&#8208;Prelog Asymmetric Reduction of Aryl&#8208;Ring&#8208;Containing Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the &#916;P84/A85G TeSADH, showing its ability to reduce prochiral ketones in anti&#8208;Prelog mode with high stereoselectivity. It emphasizes the role of P84 in changing TeSADH's stereopreference. The mutant has a wide substrate range, including those accepted by W110 mutants with opposite stereopreference. This opens opportunities for transformations like bienzymatic racemization and stereoinversion using enantiocomplementary mutants of TeSADH.







Abstract
The biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones offers a promising approach for producing optically active secondary alcohols. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are enzymes that facilitate the reversible conversion of prochiral ketones into their corresponding optically active secondary alcohols, and thus are pivotal for this process. Most ADHs adhere to Prelog's rule in determining the stereopreference for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. This study focuses on the &#916;P84/A85G mutation of TeSADH, demonstrating its capability to reduce aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones to their corresponding alcohols in anti&#8208;Prelog mode with high stereoselectivities. The study also highlights the crucial role of P84 in switching the stereopreference of TeSADH in the asymmetric reduction of aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones. Furthermore, this mutant exhibits a broad substrate scope, including substrates accepted by the previously reported W110 mutants of TeSADH with opposite stereopreference. The ability to create mutants of the same enzyme with opposite stereopreferences presents intriguing opportunities for fascinating transformations, such as bienzymatic racemization, which can be utilized in dynamic kinetic resolution, and stereoinversion using two enantiocomplementary mutants of the same enzyme.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Pyrazolato Complex Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Alkylation of Ketones and Arylacetonitriles with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(III)&#8208;pyrazolato complex effectively catalyzed the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols and borrowing hydrogen strategy was employed. The same catalyst was utilized to synthesize quinolines from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohols and ketones through dehydrogenative coupling.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of an air&#8208;stable iridium pyrazolato complex as an effective catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols, employing borrowing hydrogen strategy. The alkylation reactions were efficiently conducted at 120&#8201;&#176;C in toluene utilizing a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). A broad range of ketones and arylacetonitriles, in combination with various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols, were successfully transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkylated products. Additionally, quinoline derivatives were synthesized from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol and ketones using dehydrogenative coupling strategy. A mechanistic investigation unveiled that the key step involved alcohol activation via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

         <title>Sequential Aerial Oxidation and Atom&#8208;Economical C&#8208;3 Chalcogenation of Indolines Facilitated by Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative and atom economic chalocogenation of indolines was achieved using potassium tert&#8208;butoxide assisted strategy, yielding C&#8208;3 chalcogenated indole derivatives with good anti&#8208;cancer activity against MDA&#8208;MB 231 and MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines. The process endorsed greener approach with air as the oxidant under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
An operationally straightforward and highly efficient potassium tert&#8208;butoxide facilitated protocol for the C&#8208;3 chalcogenation of indolines under catalyst and additive&#8208;free conditions has been established under ambient temperature. The salient features of the process include the development of transition metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free and iodine&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economic and cost&#8208;effective reaction conditions at room temperature in DMSO as solvent for regioselective generation of 3&#8208;chalcogenyl indoles in high yields. The mechanistic interpretation through controlled experiments and analysis of intermediates suggests the prevalence of the ionic pathway. The reaction is scalable to gram&#8208;scale without a significant decrease in product yield, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale applications. This protocol offers a practical and environment friendly approach to accessing a diverse range of 3&#8208;arylthioindoles and 3&#8208;arylselenylindoles withstanding electron releasing and withdrawing substituents in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the biological evaluation of the 3&#8208;arylselenylindole products exhibited significant activity against breast cancer and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines MCF&#8208;7, and MDA&#8208;MB 231. These results indicate the derivatives to be potent candidates for further SAR study.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Glycosylation Mediated by Trifluoromethyl Thianthrenium Triflate with Thioglycoside Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioglycosides as glycosyl donors were activated by trifluoromethyl radicals, generated from trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722;) under visible light irradiation with Rose Bengal as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation using a p&#8208;tolyl thioglycoside donor in the presence of trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722;) has been investigated. This approach involves generating a trifluoromethyl radical via single electron transfer between TT&#8208;CF3+TfO&#8722; and the photocatalyst Rose Bengal, thereby activating thioglycosides and facilitating glycosylation. This method operates under mild reaction conditions and tolerates a variety of functional groups.

         <title>Chemoselective Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction on a Labile Framework of Enone and Acrylamide: Tricyclohexylphosphine as a Stable and Economical Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tricyclohexylphosphine mediated an Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate, has been achieved. The reaction has broad substrate scope. Control experiments have been used to address the instability of precursors.







Abstract
Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (IRC) reaction is an atom&#8208;economical way of making carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings. However, its sensitivity towards electronic and steric parameters limits the reaction and stems the need for further development. Acrylamides have been one such left out of their sensitivity. Herein we report an IRC reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate. The cyclization has been achieved on a labile and challenging framework, prone to decomposition. Different control experiments have addressed the instability of the precursor. Protocol was further extendable to annulation for benzo analogs. We also report tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) as a stable, commercial, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nucleophilic catalyst in the field of IRC reactions as compared to earlier well&#8208;established trimethyl and tributyl phosphines. Me3P and Bu3P although useful, are sensitive, prone to oxidation, and need careful handling. The protocol leads to the synthesis of piperidone and dihydroquinolone frameworks. A quick study to test the feasibility of catalyzing the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction by PCy3 was also done successfully, although in moderate yields.

Representatives of 5 new tetracyclic ring systems, related to CNS drug tianeptine, are described, based on the 6,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[c,f][1,2]thiazepine 5,5&#8208;dioxide core, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;carbon bridge between the sulfonamide nitrogen and the heteroatom at position 11.







Abstract
In continuation of our commitment to the synthesis of new ring systems based on the 6,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[c,f][1,2]thiazepine 5,5&#8208;dioxide core of the antidepressant drug tianeptine, we have incorporated two&#8208; and/or three&#8208;carbon bridges between the nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide moiety and the N&#8208;, O&#8208; or S&#8208;substituent at position 11 of the tricycle. The synthesis of 5 new ring systems is described and demonstrated with several target compounds.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photocatalyst&#8208;free enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acids under mild conditions. This novel approach demonstrates excellent enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
In this study, we present an efficient radical approach for the enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) as a catalyst under mild conditions, without the need for metals, photocatalysts, and other additives. Prochiral &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals generated from RAEs were successfully introduced to N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives, including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline, resulting in a range of valuable chiral alkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes with secondary amines in high yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The chiral phosphoric acid catalyst not only activates the substrate and induces asymmetry but also facilitates essential electron transfer processes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Semi&#8208;Saturated Fused Polycyclic Iminosugars by a Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component reactions of commercially available anilines, cycloenones, and D&#8208;ribose tosylate gave two novel iminosugars stereoselectively through a Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. The synthetic method was used to obtain a series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars and will enable the preparation of bioactive iminosugar analogues with structural diversity.







Abstract
A series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars were synthesized by one&#8208;pot stereoselective three&#8208;component reactions of D&#8208;ribose tosylate, aniline and cycloenones under heating conditions. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. In this way, various novel complex fused iminosugars were obtained through a normal Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy will enable the preparation of bioactive iminosugar analogues with structural diversity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8211;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides with allylic sulfones, facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. The reaction is characterized by base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a wide range of substrate compatibility, and high tolerance for functional groups. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate that the allylation process proceeds via a radical intermediate.







Abstract
Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8211;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8211;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions with unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamine&#8208;TfOH were successfully achieved. This mechanochemical organocatalysis featured with high efficiency, atom economy, solvent&#8208;free catalysis and high stereoselectivity Furthermore, unreactive substrates, which could not be promoted in solution, could proceed smoothly under ball&#8208;milling conditions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, chiral 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this mechanochemical asymmetric catalytic protocol and afforded high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes by Organophotoredox Catalytic Diastereoselective Anion Radical [2+2] Photocycloadditions of Arylenones under Batch and Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones promoted by Eosin Y under visible light. The reaction achieved high yields of bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes, with diastereoselectivity influenced by the reaction conditions. Additionally, DFT investigations were performed to clarify the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this study, the anion radical [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones was investigated under batch and flow conditions. The reaction was promoted by LiBr as a Lewis acid and catalyzed by Eosin Y under visible light irradiation. Symmetrical enones and asymmetrical unsaturated ketoesters were effectively cyclized to yield substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes in high yield and diastereoselectivity. Through the exploration of different experimental setups and reaction conditions, a precise control over the diastereoselectivity of the process was achieved, favoring the formation of either cis or trans substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the anion radical [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl-enones was investigated under batch and flow conditions. The reaction was promoted by LiBr as a Lewis acid and catalyzed by Eosin Y under visible light irradiation. Symmetrical enones and asymmetrical unsaturated ketoesters were effectively cyclized to yield substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes in high yield and diastereoselectivity. Through the exploration of different experimental setups and reaction conditions, a precise control over the diastereoselectivity of the process was achieved, favoring the formation of either &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes. In-flow experiments allowed to further improve the efficiency of the methodology, leading to higher productivity and space time yields. Furthermore, DFT investigations were conducted in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular electronics (moletronics) lead to ultimate miniaturization and excellent efficiencies that could replace contemporary silicon&#8208;based electronics or circuits in the near future. In this aspect, redox&#8208;based transformations or switching at single&#8208;molecule break junctions would be of epitome significance to reveal physicochemical phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.

         <title>Chromium in Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis: Unique Reactivity, Mechanisms and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium, a transition metal traditionally associated with classical catalytic processes, is now showing unique reactivity in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their mechanisms and future directions.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged as a prominent research area in modern organic synthesis and environmental science. As an important transition metal, chromium has garnered widespread attention in the field of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis in recent years, primarily manifested in the following aspects: a) the unique photochemical properties of chromium(III) complexes endow them with longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes and higher reactivities under certain conditions; b) by harnessing visible light to induce single&#8208;electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer to generate radicals, which subsequently form alkyl&#8208;chromium(III) intermediates with chromium(II) ligands, these intermediates can selectively attack electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of target products; c) following metals like cerium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and bismuth, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction pathways in chromium photocatalysis have also been extensively investigated. This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their unique reactivity, mechanisms, and future directions.

         <dc:description>
The first rearrangement of an oxazole nucleus to a thiazoline ring was achieved under mild conditions through a multicomponent reaction featuring 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxazoles, thiosemicarbazide, and a carbonyl compound to provide isothiosemicarbazones, which undergo oxazole ring&#8208;opening and recyclization to functionalized 2&#8208;hydrazono&#8208;3&#8208;thiazolines (34&#8211;98&#8201;% yield) in a chemo&#8208; and stereoselective manner.







Abstract

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light mediated Cu(I) catalyzed amino&#8208;hydroxylation and amino&#8208;alkoxylation of vinyl arenes are developed. Notably, this method employs readily accessible CuI/2,9&#8208;dimethyl 4,7&#8208;diphenyl 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline complex as photocatalyst and N&#8208;amino pyridinium salt as N&#8208;centered radical precursor. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, opening new avenues for copper&#8208;based photocatalysis.







Abstract
Aminohydroxylation of alkene is an important method for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols, which are found in natural products, pharmaceutically active compounds, and several marketed drugs. Herein, we report the development of visible&#8208;light mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed aminohydroxylation and aminoalkoxylation of alkenes. In contrast to expensive iridium, ruthenium, or organic&#8208;dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts, this protocol takes advantage of economical copper phenanthroline complex as a photocatalyst for the generation of N&#8208;centred radical from N&#8208;amino pyridinium salt. Furthermore, this protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and regiospecific.

         <title>Insights Into the Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Coupling of Terminal Alkynes with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally characterized bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium (II) complexes have been reported. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that magnesium amide (Mg&#8208;1) serves as a precatalyst for carbodiimide hydroalkynylation reaction. The active catalyst, bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide (Mg&#8208;2), and the intermediate (Mg&#8208;3) have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. Moreover, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium propiolamidate (Mg&#8208;4) has been reported.







Abstract
The bis&#8208;guanidinate anion stabilized amido magnesium (II) compound [LMgN(SiMe3)2; L={(ArHN)(ArN)&#8722;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar=2,6&#8208;Et2&#8722;C6H3}] (Mg&#8208;1) has been synthesized and characterized. It has been successfully employed as a pre&#8208;catalyst for the catalytic C&#8722;C coupling of terminal alkynes with carbodiimides, producing propiolamidine products with moderate to good yields. The active catalyst bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide [LMgC&#8801;C&#8722;Ph]2 (Mg&#8208;2) and the intermediate magnesium propiolamidinate [LMg{(NiPr)2C}C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph] (Mg&#8208;3) involved in the catalytic reaction were isolated and thoroughly characterized through multinuclear NMR and mass spectral analyses, as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Based on the above findings, a plausible mechanistic cycle has been proposed. Additionally, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate supported structurally characterized magnesium propiolamidate compound [LMg{(4&#8722;CH3&#8722;C6H4)N&#8722;(C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)=O]2 (Mg&#8208;4) has been described via the reaction between Mg&#8208;2 and isocyanate.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8208;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Catalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Aryl Acetic Acids by Late&#8208;Stage Bromination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a catalytic late&#8208;stage bromination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of aryl acetic acid. The aryl acetic acid was transformed into enediolate in the presence of an (AcO)4B2O with the combination of DBU, and consequently underwent an electrophilic bromination reaction with pyridinium tribromide. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;bromo aryl acetic acids were isolated in yields of 19&#8208;65%. In addition, the reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and several transformations of the products were carried out.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>6&#8209;Oxazaaceanthrylenes have been synthesized for the first time via a selective SNAr reaction or Ullmann&#8208;coupling of phenols, followed by a C&#8208;H activation reaction. The reaction has been carefully optimized and permits the selective synthesis of N,O&#8208;doped aceanthrylenes in moderate to excellent yields and tolerate various functional groups. The aromatic behavior of the hitherto unknown heterocyclic scaffold has been further analyzed by NICS and NICS2BC calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Silyl Radical&#8208;Participated Silylfunctionalization of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes and alkynes are inexpensive and readily available basic chemicals. Silyl radical&#8208;participated silylation of alkenes and alkynes provides a powerful tool for the direct construction of organosilicon compounds. Compared to hydrosilylation reactions, silylfunctionalization reactions are more attractive and advantageous in building diverse organosilicon compounds, which has led to their becoming a research focus in organic synthesis. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in silyl radical&#8208;participated silylfunctionalization of alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the redox potential (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8226; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#183;H2O). TTF+&#8226; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A decarboxylative fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acids was developed by the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalysis system.

         <title>Tunable and&#160;selective transformation of aromatic thioether enabled by regulating active species under visible light irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8208;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8226;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8208;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8208;S bond activation and cleavage.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;transfer catalysts (PTCs) are chemical agents that facilitate the transfer of molecules or ions between different reaction phases, thereby accelerating heterogeneous reaction processes. Transition metal catalysts are renowned for their versatility in breaking inert chemical bonds and forming new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Over the past two decades, integrating metal catalysts with phase&#8208;transfer catalysts has emerged as a highly valuable and adaptable strategy in modern organic synthesis. This combined catalytic approach highlights the enhanced synthetic capabilities and demonstrates the benefits of merging these two catalytic systems.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Chiral Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine&#8208;based rigid and three&#8208;dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and&#160;pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories;&#160;(1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses and Properties of Two Isomeric Phenanthroacephenanthrylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.</dc:description>

However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst.

         <title>Effect&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Dithioacetal Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for discovering bioactive compounds can be time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive, often requiring extensive synthesis and evaluation. To address these challenges, this study combines TLC&#8208;based assays with dithioacetal mixture&#8208;library preparation, enabling rapid and effective bioactivity screening. Tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin production and fruit browning, serves as a significant therapeutic target in this context. Despite the substantial potential of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in medicinal chemistry, the use of dithioacetals in drug discovery remains limited. In this study, two small libraries of dithioacetals, comprising more than 150 compounds, were prepared as mixture&#8208;libraries and screened on TLC by directly measuring tyrosinase activity on the plate surface. This approach facilitated the efficient preparation and identification of a potent, simple, and readily accessible dithioacetal inhibitor of tyrosinase, with the entire process being conducted on a low milligram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated Formal [3 + 2] / [4+2] Cycloaddition of&#160;N&#8208;Aryl Cyclopropyl and Cyclobutylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic transformations initiated by photochemical activation have been at the forefront of reaction discovery.&#160;In this study, we present a formal photochemical [3 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloaddition using&#160;N&#8208;aryl cyclopropylamines and N&#8208;aryl cyclobutylamines in conjunction with&#160;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems, unveiling two distinct mechanistic pathways. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition is elucidated as being guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic transformations initiated by photochemical activation have been at the forefront of reaction discovery.&#160;In this study, we present a formal photochemical [3 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloaddition using&#160;N-aryl cyclopropylamines and N-aryl cyclobutylamines in conjunction with&#160;&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl systems, unveiling two distinct mechanistic pathways. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition is elucidated as being guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex. Simultaneously, intermolecular [4 + 2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines is achieved by visible-light photoredox catalysis. These simple methodologies have wide applicability, facilitating the synthesis of&#160;N-arylaminocycloalkyl compounds in yields ranging from good to excellent&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8208;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Regioselective Tandem Cyclization Protocol to Trifluoromethylated Pyrrolidones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5 + 1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5 + 2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100% atomic utilization efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic mechanistic study employing&#160;kobs&#160;kineticsmeasurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) / H2O in 50 % MeCN / CH2Cl2&#160;at 25.0 &#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961; = &#8208;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2&#160;and 4&#8208;NO2&#160;substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in situ from TCCA and the benzyl alcohol, as the actual oxidizing species. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2&#160;in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodoaniline Dependent Formation of N&#8208;Aroylguanidines versus 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolinones from Palladium(0) Catalysed Aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;Arylguanidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
A family of N,N&#180;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70%&#8722;92% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70%&#8722;93% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed.

The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the &#8208;C(O)Ar unit in N&#8208;aroylguanidines contain 2&#8208;aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core.

A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2-iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2-aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2-aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above-mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the -C(O)Ar unit in N-aroylguanidines contain 2-aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both. The reactions of a pair of N-aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2-aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core.

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3'&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8208;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of Nmethylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization : Selective Synthesis of Trifluoroethylated Benzopyran and Benzopyranone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have realized the photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction, enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures and excellent yields.&#160;Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst load, strong regional control and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by the density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be easily accomplished.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling technique for synthesizing (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from 1&#8208;arylbutadienes and styrenes, respectively. By employing easily available and inexpensive reagents, this method enables the synthesis of a diverse array of dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones with excellent functional group tolerance under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. It also proves versatile for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and the scale&#8208;up reactions. The method showcases notable selectivity, gentle reaction conditions, and compatibility with various functional groups as demonstrated through 66 examples with excellent display of regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amides and impact of the fluorinated group on the lipophilicity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with yields going from 43% to quantitative isolated yield. We showed that a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8211;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8211;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized&#160;&#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
