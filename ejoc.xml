         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Oxadiazines, Mechanistic insights and Pathways</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis and mechanistic pathways of oxadiazines, highlighting their significance in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and industry. Recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalytic, and green approaches are examined, along with key strategies such as cycloaddition and oxidative annulation, etc. Mechanistic insights into intermediates, transition states, and catalyst roles are discussed to refine synthetic pathways and enhance efficiency.







Abstract
Oxadiazine has the distinctive structure of a six&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring with two nitrogen and one oxygen atoms. This molecule has lately gained substantial attention due to its promising uses in several sectors, including medicines, agrochemicals, and material science. As a result, the synthesis of oxadiazine is extensively explored for its application in pharmaceuticals, pest control, and medical treatments due to its antibacterial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory and insecticidal effects. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of oxadiazine&#8216;s synthetic strategies and mechanistic aspects, prioritizing the various novel methods developed for synthesising oxadiazine. We demonstrated the synthesis of various oxadiazine derivatives such as 1,3,4&#8208;, 1,3,5&#8208;, 1,2,4&#8208;, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazines and the functionalization of this molecule to enhance their bioactivity. In this study, we discussed an overview of synthetic routes, such as cyclization reactions, cycloaddition reactions, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free reactions, triflate&#8208;catalyzed reactions, etc. We highlighted the challenges faced in the reported synthesis, suitable reaction conditions, substrate scope and applications.

         <title>Multianalytical Characterization of Acrylic Industrial Paints Used in Contemporary Mural Art</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contemporary outdoor mural paintings are artworks affected by exposure to sunlight, rain, and environmental pollutants. Three commercial white paints used by street artists are characterized by a multianalytical approach. Analysis of cross sections from samples of two mural paintings reveals the painting technique, while characterization of their materials explains differences in their conservation conditions.

Contemporary outdoor mural paintings have been recognized as artistic expressions closely connected with urban communities. These artworks are prone to suffer deterioration due to exposure to harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, knowledge on painting materials used by street artists is mandatory for the preservation of these paintings. In this study, for the first time, the composition of white household paints of three brands from the local market is investigated. Organic and inorganic components are identified by a multianalytical approach using scanning electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, attenuated total reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The paints contain a styrene&#8211;acrylic copolymer and titanium white in the rutile phase as pigment. Then, two mural paintings are selected to collect samples in order to perform a stratigraphic study and characterize their materials and painting technique. In the mural &#8220;Toad on the wrong way,&#8221; the use of an acrylic resin as varnish contributes to its conservation. In the red sample of &#8220;CIDEC factory,&#8221; the identification of Pigment Red 149 (PR149) allows us to attribute the fading of the red areas to the photo&#8208;oxidation reaction of this synthetic organic pigment.

         <title>Organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;Regioselective Formal (1+5) Cycloaddition of Isoindolinone&#8208;Derived Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective formal (1+5) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols with 2&#8208;indolylphenols was established, which afforded a series of indole&#8208;fused chromanes in overall good yields. This work not only established the first &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective (1+n) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols, but also provided a good example of 1,5&#8208;CO&#8208;regioselective (5+1) cycloadditions involving 2&#8208;indolylphenols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;fused chromanes.







Abstract
An organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective formal (1+5) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols with 2&#8208;indolylphenols was established, which afforded a series of indole&#8208;fused chromanes with potential antitumor activity in overall good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). A tandem cycloaddition process was proposed based on detailed control experiments. Moreover, biological evaluation demonstrates the promising application of indole&#8208;fused chromanes. This work not only established the first &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective (1+n) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols, but also provided a good example of 1,5&#8208;CO&#8208;regioselective (5+1) cycloadditions involving 2&#8208;indolylphenols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;fused chromanes with potential biological activity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Radical Strategy for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component radical reaction involving alcohols or alkanes and in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed imines. The imines, generated from aldehydes and amines, serve as key reactants, while the inexpensive and readily available sodium decatungstate (NaDT) is employed as a photocatalyst. This strategy enables the functionalization of industrially accessible alcohols or alkanes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction is operationally simple, exhibits high conversion efficiency, facilitates straightforward post&#8208;reaction processing, and demonstrates excellent atom and step economy.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes Enabled by Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using commercially available iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) as catalysts, and cheap phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing agent. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature with air as sole oxidant. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and convenient protocol for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using readily available iron salt Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, and phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing material. All reactions proceed efficiently at mild conditions with air as terminal oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, and is distinguished by its simplicity, mild temperatures and broad scope. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Enone&#8208;Tethered Ketones and Aldehydes with Indoles: Substrate&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Indenes and Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diversity&#8208;oriented one&#8208;pot synthesis of indenes and indanes has been realized under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The Michael&#8211;Aldol cascade process involving reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles to readily access indenes is demonstrated in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. However, a reaction sequence that involves Michael&#8211;Aldol, and nucleophilic substitution gives indanes bearing indole moieties by employing enone&#8208;tethered aldehyde as a reaction partner with indoles.







Abstract
A cascade strategy involving the reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles for the synthesis of indenes is outlined in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. Halogen bonding between molecular iodine and enones activates substrates to undergo Michael addition with indoles, resulting in the formation of enolates. These enolates in&#8197;situ are transformed into indenes via an intramolecular aldol condensation. Enone&#8208;tethered aldehydes, however, react with two molecules of indoles to give indanes through a reaction sequence that involves chemoselective Michael addition followed by intramolecular aldol, and nucleophilic substitution. The substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis has been realized to readily access indenes and indanes bearing indole moieties under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The compatibility of these reactions has also been tested with a scale&#8208;up reaction for practical applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Fluorescence Properties of Oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines: Exploring Structure&#8208;Property Relationships and Design Strategies for Tailored Photophysical Characteristics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, absorption and fluorescence spectra, and quantum yields of a series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines are reported. The oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation.







Abstract
A series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation. The systematic investigation of the photophysical properties of the synthesized compounds revealed that the position and nature of the substituents on the oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline core significantly influenced the absorption and emission characteristics. The 6,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution pattern was found to provide an optimal balance between high fluorescence quantum yield and moderate Stokes shift, whereas the 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution offered a unique combination of large Stokes shift and long wavelength emission. Additionally, the presence of a trifluoromethyl group at the C&#8208;9 position was identified as a crucial structural feature for maintaining strong fluorescence. These structure&#8208;property relationships provide valuable insights for the rational design of novel fluorescent oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives with tailored photophysical properties, which could find potential applications in the development of fluorescent probes and organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

A series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were prepared in excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities by an asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/hemiketalization/amination process involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines. The subsequent oxidative aromatization delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in moderate to high yields and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric Michael/hemiketalization/amination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines catalysed by a quinine&#8208;derived urea catalyst has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (35&#8211;94&#8201;% yield for two steps and up to 99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the subsequent oxidative aromatization of chiral 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in 69&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and up to 95&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Synthesis of Xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;Phosphinates and Insights into Their Conformational Preferences Within a Chimeric Duplex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for synthesizing xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks was developed, and a DNA:XNA:DNA chimeric decamer with a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleotide was chemically synthesized and analysed. The xylose sugar adopts an N&#8208;type conformation, while the extra methylene group introduces flexibility, disrupting hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions, reducing duplex thermal stability compared to unmodified DNA.







Abstract
An efficient method for the synthesis of xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks containing both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases is reported. A DNA&#8208;phoXyloNA&#8208;DNA chimeric sequence containing a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleoside uracil residue was chemically synthesized, and its structural properties were examined using advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational simulations. Results outlined herein suggest that the xylose sugar moiety predominantly favors an N&#8208;type conformation stabilized by intraresidue hydrogen bonding interactions, while the inclusion of an extra methylene group in the backbone introduces significant flexibility within the internucleotide linkage. Within a duplex structure, disrupted hydrogen bonding interactions in the xU5::dA16 base pair, combined with diminished stacking interactions at the site of modification collectively contribute to a reduction in thermal stability compared to the unmodified counterpart. These findings enhance our understanding of the stability and dynamics of orthogonal backbone&#8208;sugar modified nucleic acids (XNAs), aiding in the design of functionally tailored analogues.

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Sultams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;enriched sultams via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition is disclosed. The target cycloadducts are prepared on a multigram scale, and the potential for further functionalization, building block synthesis, and antiviral activity is revealed for selected representatives.







Abstract
A highly efficient multigram synthesis of fused sultams (up to 97&#8197;g in a single run) via the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sultams was developed. The scope and limitations of the method were studied by evaluating common 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds. The reactions with azomethine ylide (obtained from N&#8208;(methoxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine), nitrile oxides (generated from chloroximes), and nitrones worked well to give the fused heterocyclic building blocks in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. In turn, attempted reactions with allenes, azides, and several other 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds were not fruitful. A series of functional group transformations were applied to obtain fused bicyclic sultam building blocks as promising derivatives for modern drug discovery. In addition to that, antiviral activity was discovered for some representatives of the synthesized bicyclic sultams.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Excited State Switching and Fluoride Responsive Behavior of Orthogonal Spiroborate Ester Derived from Naturally Occurring &#945;&#8208;Mangostin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiro&#8208;centered boron&#8208;based ester (MBO), derived from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit, has been synthesized and characterized. Its photophysical properties and anion&#8208;binding potential were systematically investigated and analyzed using a series of well&#8208;established spectroscopic techniques.







Abstract
This study presents a sustainable and efficient method for synthesizing a spiroborate ester (MBO) from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), a natural xanthonoid isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit. The synthetic process, structural characterization and photophysical properties of MBO are thoroughly discussed. MBO exhibits an absorption band at 370&#8197;nm, with a shoulder around 410&#8211;450&#8197;nm in non&#8208;polar solvents, which shifts to 424&#8197;nm in polar protic solvents. The compound displays green to blue emission, with intensity decreasing in polar protic environments. These spectral changes result from hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted excited state switching between n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* states, as confirmed by computational studies. MBO also shows excellent anion binding properties, functioning as a dual&#8208;channel probe for both colorimetric and turn&#8208;on fluorescence detection of fluoride ions. This approach not only adds value to the residual mangosteen pericarp by converting it into a fluorescent sensor but also offers a semisynthetic, environmentally benign alternative to conventional organic receptors for fluoride detection.

         <dc:description>Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported Ni(0) complex were studied. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov products were obtained in 62~89% yield, along with the alkanes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenyldisilane as minor products. The resting&#8208;state complexes of hydrosilylation reactions were isolated and characterized by spectroscopic method and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which represent rare&#8208;example of Ni(0) silyl complexes supported by scandium ions via a Ni(0)&#8594;Sc(III) interaction.

Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via regioselective C&#8722;H bond activation is both highly efficient and atom&#8208;economical but often hindered by the use of toxic solvents and limited catalyst recyclability. Herein, we present a recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation of N&#8208;pyrimidinyl aryl amines with cyclic 1,3&#8208;diones in water, affording tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives. The basic aqueous environment amplifies the solubility differences between the substrates and the desired product, thereby promoting efficient C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization. This method showcases broad substrate compatibility, eliminates the need for pre&#8208;synthesized iodonium ylides, and features an easy work&#8208;up procedure alongside straightforward catalyst recovery. The Rh(III) catalyst retains its activity for at least five cycles, providing a sustainable and practical strategy for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances of Enaminones in Multi&#8208;component Reactions: A Brief Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enaminones as the valuable and versatile synthons are widely used in organic synthesis, particularly in the form of multicomponent reactions. This review describes recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.







Abstract
As we know, multicomponent reactions have emerged as powerful tools in organic synthesis due to their high atom and step economy, eco&#8208;friendly, diversity, convenience, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and have broad application prospects in many fields such as drug synthesis, material science and natural product synthesis. On the other side, enaminones, which contain amine&#8208;alkene&#8208;carbonyl conjugated structure possessing multiple reactive sites, have extensively served as versatile building blocks for the construction of diverse organic molecules. In this review, we describe recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4+1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4+1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8208;Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#8208;N bonds and the direct construction of indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles, but also enriches the research contents of formal (4+1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.</dc:description>

Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones have garnered significant research interest due to their diverse biological activities and potential pharmaceutical applications. This review systematically summarizes the latest synthesis methods for constructing pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, categorized by starting materials, including those from nitrobenzenes, azides, benzimidazoles, and others.







Abstract
Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones are recognized as important tricyclic scaffolds due to their diverse pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;fungi, anti&#8208;tuberculosis, and antimalarial, as well as their roles as 5&#8208;HT3 receptor agonists and kinase inhibitors targeting CK2 and AKT, and others. Developing efficient and reliable synthetic approaches to access these compounds remains an attractive goal in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, particularly focusing on strategies that maintain the A and C&#8208;rings while constructing the B&#8208;ring through the formation of a&#8208;, b&#8208;, and c&#8208;bonds. The information collected describes the two key components of the synthesis process 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Substitued&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole and aldehyde or its surrogate. This review also briefly summarizes the reaction mechanisms for the formation of tricyclic skeletons to determine the key factors governing the issues of productivity and regioselectivity. Through analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing synthetic methods, we predict that A&#8208;ring formation strategy&#8208;based pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxaline reactions will be developed in the future. We hope that this review will motivate the search for novel strategies to synthesize pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, accessing tricyclic skeletons that may have potential applications in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and many branches of chemistry.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;H Functionalization and Annulation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Quinazolinones and 3&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Quinazolinones via Site Selective Transformations</title>

         <dc:description>
The selective transformations of quinazolinones through transition metal catalysed C&#8722;H bonds functionalization via amide nitrogen site annulation and aryl nitrogen site annulation is a valuable synthetic tool, that has been explored by various chemists and medicinal chemistry researchers. This review provides an extensive study of directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted site selective transformation of quinazolinones using transition metal as catalyst.







Abstract
Quinazolinone is a crucial scaffold in numerous natural compounds, as well as in biologically active and functional materials. Consequently, various synthetic methods have been developed to transform quinazolinone and its derivatives. Site selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization and annulation of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones skeleton through transition&#8208;metal catalysis offer an efficient approach to obtain diverse substituted nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic frameworks. This review summarizes recent reports on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed site selective transformations of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinone and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones through C&#8722;H functionalization and annulation reactions.

         <title>Axially Chiral Naphthalol Benzo&#8208;Quinoline Ligands for the Cu(OTf)2&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Arylidene Diazosuccinimides and Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands, synthesized via a scalable Combes quinoline route using NOBIN and H8&#8208;NOBIN. Ligand L1, in combination with Cu(OTf)&#8322;, catalyzed the enantioselective cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes, yielding chiral spirocyclopropane succinimides with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands was designed and prepared from commercially available 2&#8242;&#8208;amino[1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalen]&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NOBIN) and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;NOBIN). Of these ligands, L1 combined effectively with Cu(OTf)2 to catalyze the cyclopropanation reactions of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes. Consequently, the desired multifunctional products bearing untouched arylidene groups were obtained in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities (&#8804;96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er) and diastereoselectivities (&#8804;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr) with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (&#8804;83&#8201;%). After simple recrystallization, the diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities of the chiral products were considerably improved (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er with &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) in most cases. This approach provides an efficient solution for the preparation of high&#8208;optical&#8208;purity multifunctional &#945;&#8208;arylidene spirocyclopropane succinimides, potentially valuable as chiral synthons and platform molecules which may be transformed into diverse functional chiral molecules by reaction at different functional sites.

         <title>Pincer Ligand Facilitated Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer ligands exhibit features of stability and control of activity and selectivity during catalysis. They participate in multicomponent reactions by either coordinating with single metals or integrating into metal nanoclusters, triggering the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds with high efficiency.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions hold a significant position in the field of organic synthetic chemistry as they can rapidly construct structurally diverse molecules with high atom economy. Pincer ligands possess unique structural and electronic properties, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity in multicomponent reactions. This review systematically elaborates on the research progress of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands, thoroughly discussing their mechanism of action in different reaction systems, including crucial aspects such as substrate activation modes, the formation and transformation of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, an in&#8208;depth analysis of the relationship between the structures of various pincer ligands and their reaction performance is carried out, and multiple representative reaction examples are presented, such as multicomponent transformation processes of carbon&#8208;carbon bond and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond formation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8208;pincer complexes or metal&#8208;pincer nanoclusters. Furthermore, the future development of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands are prospected. It is anticipated that they will play a more crucial role in the development of novel organic synthetic methodologies, drug synthesis, and materials science, providing valuable references and inspiration for researchers in related fields.

         <title>Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work described the synthesis of stannylenoid 2 from dialkylstannylene and sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP). The stability of 2 in THF and its reactivity under irradiation, leading to the formation of compound 7, are investigated. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveals an Sn&#8322;P&#8322; four&#8208;membered ring, shedding light on stannylenoid reactivity and its synthetic potential.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid 2 through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid 2 exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, 2 undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound 7. The solid&#8208;state structure of 7, determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals a diamond&#8208;shaped Sn&#8322;P&#8322; moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8722;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;This work described the synthesis of stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; from dialkylstannylene and sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP). The stability of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in THF and its reactivity under irradiation, leading to the formation of compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, are investigated. Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveals an Sn&#8322;P&#8322; four-membered ring, shedding light on stannylenoid reactivity and its synthetic potential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. The solid-state structure of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, reveals a diamond-shaped Sn&#8322;P&#8322; moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8722;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terpenes and&#160;Terpenoids: How&#160;Can we Use&#160;them?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The employed feedstocks in chemical processes received substantial attention over the past decades, mainly due to the popularity of Werpy&#8217;s list of top&#8208;value added chemicals from biomass reported in 2004. The conventional fossil&#8208;based feedstocks are both depleting and can be damaging to the environment. This led to a surge to replace petroleum&#8208;based chemicals to more renewable, bio&#8208;based platform chemicals. Terpenes and terpenoids are a group of bio&#8208;based compounds that are well known. However, there comprehensive overviews of the chemistry that these compounds have been used for are scarce. Herein, we provide a full comprehensive overview of the reported chemistry with terpenes while specifically highlighting their reactivity. Fifteen of the most common and useful monoterpenes and terpenoids are discussed, followed by a list of the remaining known compounds belonging to this group. The fifteen compounds have been employed in a vast number of chemical transformations with different applications including: polymerizations, total syntheses, chiral reagents/auxiliaries, pharmaceuticals, and chemical conversion to other useful bio&#8208;based chemicals. We believe that the presented chemistry in this work will provide chemists with a useful tool that should facilitate and stimulate the search for more sustainable, renewable and environmentally friendly starting points for novel synthesis routes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Zeolite Catalyzed Dehydrative N&#8208;Benzylation of Amides for the Construction of Macrolactams Under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report continuous&#8208;flow dehydrative N&#8208;benzylation of amides using benzylic alcohols by reusable Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a heterogeneous catalyst. This method is scalable to grams and demonstrated for 30 amides and 15 macrolactams with water as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of acyclic amides and macrolactams has been demonstrated successfully via N&#8208;benzylation of amides using a highly reusable heterogeneous Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a catalyst, which gives only water as the byproduct. N&#8208;Benzylation of acyclic amides furnished 30&#8197;N&#8208;benzylated amides whereas intramolecular N&#8208;benzylation with alcohols was well tolerated with 15 examples of macrolactams bearing 11&#8208; to 15&#8208;membered rings. Notably, the scalability of this flow process has been demonstrated from milligrams to gram scale using the Ru&#8208;Zeolite heterogeneous catalyst. Moreover, the reusability of the catalyst is exemplified by the 16 reaction cycles carried out with one time&#8208;packed heterogeneous catalyst in the reactor bed.

         <title>An Efficient Synthetic Methodology for the Preparation of Glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents an efficient methodology to prepare glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl glycosyl ethers. The synthetic route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions proceed with retention of the anomeric configuration. Additionally, the synthetic route afforded other useful compounds, such as glycosyl isoxazolines and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones, which can be employed in further synthetic and biological studies.







Abstract
In this study, we present a synthetic methodology for preparing glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl ethers. The process involves three steps: nitrile oxide cycloadditions, reduction of the glycosyl isoxazolines, and oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions were conducted with retention of the anomeric configuration. The resulting glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones were then utilized in the synthesis of the corresponding pyrazoles.

         <dc:description>
A dehydrogenative photoredox catalyzed formal C(sp3)&#8208;H intramolecular cyclization of indolyl&#8208;oximes to generate indolyl &#916;2&#8208;isoxazolines is reported. In contrast to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the reaction avoids the use of super stoichiometric chemical oxidants and high reaction temperatures and is proposed to operate via two sequential single electron oxidation events.

         <title>Substitution Pattern of the Secondary Rim of ICyD Ligand Influences Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution pattern of the secondary rim in NHC&#8208;capped cyclodextrin gold complexes significantly influences the reactivity and stereoselectivity of gold&#8208;catalyzed enyne cycloisomerizations. A custom&#8208;designed benzyl&#8208;methyl substitution pattern delivers the highest yields and selectivities.







Abstract
The synthesis and evaluation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;capped cyclodextrins with various protecting groups were carried out. The corresponding gold complexes catalyze the stereoselective cycloisomerization of enynes. Permethylation of the cyclodextrin's hydroxyl groups improves yield and selectivity compared to its benzylated counterpart. Notably, alternating methyl and benzyl groups on the secondary rim of the cyclodextrin further enhances asymmetry, achieving even higher enantioselectivities. To synthesize this compound, we optimized the selective deprotection of all benzyl groups at the 2&#8208;position of the sugar residues in the cyclodextrin.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters Using Me3SiI</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the absence of any catalyst, polyester plastic wastes are depolymerized with Me3Si&#8722;I into a variety of value&#8208;added compounds. The reaction outcomes and the nature of the end products are influenced by the solvent, the temperature, the amount of Me3SiI and the length of the carbon backbone between the carboxyl fragments.







Abstract
Iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI) promotes the depolymerization of a variety of alkyl and aromatic polyesters, such as poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), polylactic acid (PLA) as well as polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates (PET, PBT), in the absence of catalyst. The monomer products, e.&#8201;g. the silylester monomers and/or their value&#8208;added derivatives, involving reactive iodo groups (alkyl iodides and acyl iodides), are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent (e.&#8201;g. CH2Cl2, CH3CN), temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C to 200&#8201;&#176;C) and the amount of Me3SiI. The depolymerization of PES gives the corresponding silylester which then cyclizes into succinic anhydride. With PLA, the ester CH3CH2CO2SiMe3 and propionyl iodide (CH3CH2COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. As expected, the decomposition of aromatic polymers PET and PBT affords the bis(trimethylsilyl) terephthalate compound (1,4&#8208;{CO2SiMe3}2C6H4). In the case of PET, the formation of the latter species is hampered by the I2, released by the decomposition of the generated diiodoethane. The initial addition of an iodine trap (1&#8208;pentyne) avoids these side reactions. This work demonstrates that the length of the carbon chain linking the carboxylic acid units is a crucial factor influencing the ease of the reaction and the nature of the products.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Cyclic Dithiocarbonates Using Bis&#8208;Benzimidazolate Salts as Multifunctional Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic dithiocarbonates (1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione) were efficiently synthesized from epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. Three different catalysts (BBE&#8722;Me, BBE&#8722;H, BBE&#8208;NO2) were designed and synthesized, with BBE&#8722;Me showing 95&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity. The catalyst enabled selective, solvent&#8208;free reactions under mild conditions. Mechanistic insights revealed simultaneous activation of CS2 and epoxides, acting as a multifunctional organocatalyst.







Abstract
Cyclic dithiocarbonates of the type 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione were selectively and efficiently produced from the reaction between epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. We have designed and synthesized this group of three nucleophilic catalysts from the neutral forms of bis&#8208;benzimidazole compounds (BBE&#8208;Me, BBE&#8208;H and BBE&#8208;NO2), through simple and efficient procedures. All three catalysts, with aryl substituents possessing different electronic characteristics, were able to selectively catalyze the production of cyclic dithiocarbonates. BBE&#8208;Me proved to be the most effective catalyst in the initial screening with 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenoxypropane, converting 95&#8201;% of the epoxide with 99&#8201;% of selectivity for the cyclic dithiocarbonate 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione. This catalyst was subsequently used to evaluate various reaction parameters and then several epoxides were selectively converted to the respective cyclic dithiocarbonates, under mild conditions, with a low catalyst loading, short reaction times, and in a solvent&#8208; and additive&#8208;free system. A mechanistic proposal, supported by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, demonstrated for the first time that a nucleophilic catalyst in this system can simultaneously activate both CS2 and the epoxide molecule.

A mild and ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman alcohols (MBHAs) and aryl triazenes was disclosed.

Abstract
We herein developed a mild and ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman alcohols (MBHAs) and aryl triazenes. After thorough screening of the acids, nitric acid (HNO3) was unexpectedly found to be the most effective promoter for in&#8197;situ generation of arenediazonium salts. This coupling reaction allows for a highly selective production of a various &#945;&#8208;arylmethyl &#946;&#8208;keto esters from readily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Chiral Thiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Cascade Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an enantioselective formal [4+1] annulation reaction to furnish trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives by using chiral thiourea catalyst. The reaction allowed to give up to 96&#8201;% yield, and up to 84&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr.







Abstract
We established an efficient asymmetric cascade pathway for the construction of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. This reaction proceeds via a Michael addition followed by an oxa&#8208;substitution, employing in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylide and ortho&#8208;hydroxy chalcone derivatives in the presence of a chiral thiourea catalyst at ambient temperature. This method accomplishes good to excellent yields and adequate stereoselectivity, with up to 84&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. A key advantage of this cascade [4+1] annulation approach is its ability to construct chiral DHBs under mild conditions with notable yields and selectivity.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Mono&#8208; and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Di&#8208;Halogenated Ketones Through Coupling of Halogenated Diboromethanes with Carboxylic Acid Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy has been developed for the controllable coupling of carboxylic acid esters with deprotonated halogenated diboromethane. A array of &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones were synthesized through using different halogenated diboromethane and electrophiles.







Abstract
Halogenated gem&#8208;diboron reagents, as structurally unique gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, are crucial in organic synthesis chemistry. Herein, we report a strategy with controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208; and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;di&#8208;halogenated ketones through nucleophilic addition reaction of halogenated diboromethanes with carboxylic acid esters. The substrate scope is broad and the nucleophilic addition reaction proceeds from a diverse range of carboxylic acid esters with bromo&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes. Moreover, an intriguing heterocyclic compound has been serendipitously synthesized as well.

         <title>Photoinduced, Decarboxylative Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids with Diselenides to Form Selenoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 12, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides under metal and sensitizer&#8208;free conditions is reported.







Abstract
A mild and green strategy for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives has been developed through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides. This transformation proceeds smoothly without requiring any external photocatalyst, additive, or oxidant. Both diaryl and dialkyl diselenides react efficiently with &#945;&#8208;keto acids to produce selenoesters in good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the generated acyl radical is responsible for this transformation.

     alt="Recent Advances in the Photochemical Synthesis of Esters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes recent progress in the photochemical synthesis of esters, including cross-coupling of carboxylic acids with aryl or alkyl halides, phenols and aldehydes or alcohols, alcohols with &#945;-keto acids, alcohols or phenols with benzaldehydes or benzylic alcohols as well as aldehydes and benzyl or alkyl halides, emphasizing the development of novel protocols, limitations and strategies for expanding the utility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for making a variety of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. The development of esterification reactions induced by light is an atom economical and energy efficient alternative to traditional methods for the synthesis of esters, with benefits including mild reaction conditions, high chemical yields, and wide functional group tolerance. This review summarizes recent progress made in this green methodology, including mechanisms of action, substrate scope, limitations and future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclooctynes as Building Blocks for Non&#8208;covalent Surface&#8208;Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various syntheses of cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) are reported. These are potential building blocks for surface&#8208;orthogonal molecular architecture on the Si(001) surface.







Abstract
Cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) have been synthesized. The 8&#8208;membered ring was derived from cyclooctadiene, by Beckmann rearrangement or by ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The transannular instability of a monocyclic cyclooctyne lactam was postulated. Three stable functionalized cyclooctynes obtained are candidates for a surface&#8208;orthogonal layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on semiconductor surfaces (in particular the Si(001) surface).

It discusses innovations in catalytic systems, reaction conditions, and substrate versatility while addressing limitations such as low reactivity of certain substrates and the challenges in asymmetric synthesis. Future directions for improving reaction efficiency and expanding applications in pharmaceuticals, catalysis, and materials science are also highlighted.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation has emerged as a significant development in the synthesis of organophosphorus acid compounds. This review covers the literature published from 1980 to 2024, systematically examining the current progress, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. The review begins with an introduction to the significance of phosphorus chemistry in both academic research and industrial applications and then explores traditional methods for synthesizing phosphonation compounds, emphasizing the limitations of these methods and the need for innovative reaction conditions. The central focus is on recent advancements in palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation, with detailed discussions of key milestones, reaction mechanisms, and the scope of substrate applicability. The review also analyzes the roles of different palladium sources, ligands, and reaction conditions, highlighting their effects on reaction efficiency and selectivity. Finally, the conclusion summarizes recent developments and proposes future research directions to address existing challenges and expand the scope of palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven E&#8208;selective Semihydrogenation and Its Application in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven E&#8208;selective semihydrogenation scheme of alkyne compounds was developed for designing and synthesizing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) inhibitors. In the present study, room&#8208;temperature semihydrogenation reactions of various alkyne compounds were successfully achieved under the irradiation of white light. The representative reaction mechanism was decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments, revealing the critical roles played by [Ir(Cp&#8208;Me5)Cl2]2, PdCl2, DPPE and TEOA as photosensitizer, catalyst, ligand, and electron donor, respectively. Our method exhibits excellent E&#8208;selectivity and broad functional group compatibility, and demonstrates its practical value by producing pinosylvin and its derivatives with strong inhibitory effects on U87 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article covers the recent development achieved in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multicomponent synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds and six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindoles.







Abstract
Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini&#8208;review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Difunctionalization of Carboranes with Benzoxazoles, Indoles and Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Icosahedral Carboranes have a wide range of applications in medicinal chemistry, material science, and catalysis. Although various methods have been disclosed for functionalizing carborane structures, the methods to incorporate different types of heterocycles are still lacking. This limitation is likely due to the functional group incompatibility under previously reported reaction conditions, and the sterically hindered environment on boron cluster vertices further complicated the reaction development. In this article, we present a streamlined protocol to prepare a new class of vicinal difunctionalized carboranes containing benzoxazoles, NH heterocycles and anilines. This method involves a direct cross&#8208;coupling between 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;m&#8208;carborane and benzoxazoles, thereby eliminating the necessity for preceding deprotonation of the acidic C2 proton present in benzoxazole. Subsequent regioselective iodination at the B(10) vertex of the carborane and the second cross&#8208;coupling reactions with diverse indoles and anilines resulted in the formation of the desired vicinal difunctionalized products.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Fluoro&#8208;Functionalized Cellulosic Materials: Synthesis, Characterization and Organic Dye Adsorption Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing interest towards biopolymers application in amphiphilic conditions prompted us to explore the preparation of fluorinated cellulosic materials. Cellulose (CE) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were functionalized with highly fluorinated pendants, through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on 3&#8208;pentadecafluoroheptyl&#8208;5&#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole (FOX). leading to the corresponding fluorinated biopolymers CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX. Structural and thermal stability confirmed covalent attachment of the fluorinated moiety onto the cellulosic skeleton and highlighted an interesting two&#8208;dimensional texture of the CMC&#8208;FOX material. Hybrid and amphiphilic features of CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX, were confirmed by water and oil contact angle measurements (WCA/OCA). Applications as adsorbent material for organic contaminants from an aqueous solution was tested by previously incorporating the functional biopolymer into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel beads. Rhodamine B (RhB) was used as a model wastewater pollutant. Fluoro&#8208;functionalization&#160;led to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency of the SA&#8208;incorporated biopolymer with respect to the corresponding non&#8208;fluorinated material (from 11% to 48% for SA/CE vs SA/CE&#8208;FOX beads and from 11% to 94% for SA/CMC vs SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads). Recyclability tests showed good residual performance of SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads after seven desorption/reuse cycles opening the way to more sustainable adsorbing processes for the removal of emerging pollutants from contaminated water.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and reactivity of 1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives using microwave activation or flow chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of some novel disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The series were developed from quinuclidinone, which afforded versatile platforms bearing one lactam function in position C&#8208;2 that was then used to create C&#8211;N bond using the Chan&#8208;Lam coupling reaction or in situ C&#8211;O bond activation via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The conditions were optimized, and a wide range of boronic acids were used to determine the scope and limitations of each method. To complete this study, a flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura process was established to afford polyfunctionalized 1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives in high yields with a very efficient process (10 min.).</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Domino Strategy for Regioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component domino strategy involving &#946;&#8208; oxodithioesters, aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones has been developed for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;thiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction proceeded through the construction of two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;S bonds in a single step to afford high product yields.







Abstract
A sustainable one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component domino strategy for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones has been developed using inexpensive, stable, and recyclable silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid as the heterogeneous catalyst under solvent&#8208;free conditions. This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones up to a 93&#8201;% yield via annulation of &#946;&#8208;oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong base under exceptionally mild conditions has been realized. This reaction proceeds directly without the needs for photoirradiation and a metal catalyst, and features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and significant potentials for preparing fluorinated bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivatization of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Organic Molecules via Intramolecular Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;containing organic molecules hold a pivotal position in organic chemistry. Due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals and material science, the synthesis of these compounds under mild reaction conditions is highly significant. In this regard, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in synthetic organic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent developments in the synthesis of biologically active heterocycles via intramolecular cross dehydrogenative coupling under transition&#8208;metal free conditions.







Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds or heterocycles constitute the most prominent class of organic chemistry. The extensive functional utility of these compounds in pharmaceuticals and material science has led to increased research interest in this area. Since heteroatom containing molecules hold a pivotal position in both chemistry and biology, a number of methodologies have already been known for their synthesis. However, advancement in the synthetic methodology for their construction under mild reaction conditions is highly important. In the current scenario of research, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in the synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones via direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This one&#8208;pot atom&#8208;economic protocol can construct fused heterocycles that are both pharmaceutically and medicinally important. The present review focuses on transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of heteroatom containing organic molecules intramolecularly through carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;heteroatom (C&#8722;X) bond formation reactions reported over past one decade.

Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway during the C&#8722;S bond formation, with an iodonium ion intermediate driving the cyclization step. Additionally, some products exhibit significant antitumor activity.

         <title>Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes as catalysts for the dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes and alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols or water is a fundamental transformation in organosilicon chemistry, enabling the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes&#8212;key materials for coatings and adhesives. Traditionally, these reactions have relied on catalysts based on platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs), which are costly and scarce. The development of Earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAM) catalysts offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative. This concept article highlights recent advancements in homogeneous EAM catalysis for these transformations, focusing on mechanistic insights, reactivity trends, and catalytic efficiencies. Catalysts based on manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, or zinc, are reshaping the field by offering efficient and selective processes for the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes. Moreover, a key feature of these catalytic systems is their ability to generate dihydrogen as a byproduct, offering potential applications in hydrogen storage and utilization. Despite the good performances of EAM catalysts in the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of silanes, challenges remain, including improving turnover numbers, substrate scope, and catalyst stability. Future developments integrating computational and experimental approaches will be key to optimizing these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Cyanoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanochemical methodology for the preparation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles through the reaction of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with primary or secondary aliphatic amines (or their respective salts) in the presence of dipotassium phosphate is reported. The process is carried out by processing the mixture of starting materials in a mixer mill, with ethanol used as a liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) additive. Dipotassium phosphate serves as a cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;toxic inorganic base, ensuring 100% carbon economy of the process. The reaction produces the corresponding oxazole products with up to 97% yield in just 10 minutes. However, preparative scope of the method is restricted to highly nucleophilic and sterically unobstructed primary and secondary aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines display low reactivity at room temperature. For instance, indoline achieves only 43% conversion to its oxazole product after 3 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Halogermylenes with NHCs: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of the Rind&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (1a) and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (1b), with two types of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2 and Im&#8208;Me4) resulted in the formation of the halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts, (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(Eind)GeBr (2a') and (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(EMind)GeCl (2b'), and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(Eind)Ge]+[Br&#8211;] (3a) and [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(EMind)Ge]+[Cl&#8211;] (3b). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligands, whose structures were confirmed by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Based on DFT and QTAIM calculations of 2a' and the cationic part of 3a, it was concluded that while the Ge&#8211;C(Eind) and Ge&#8211;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&#8211;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands. The formation mechanism of 3a from 1a and two NHC molecules via (Im&#8208;Me4)(Eind)GeBr (2a) is discussed based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters: Impact of Reaction Parameters &amp; Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate exhibited either high values for regioselectivity (96&#8201;%) or selectivity (78&#8201;%) for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde&#8197;2&#8201;a depending on pressure, CO/H2 composition and temperature in a design of experiments approach. Expanding the substrate scope gave insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealing a significant electronic influence of the substituent on regioselectivity and selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.







Abstract
The hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters represents a highly atom&#8208;economical route towards &#946;&#8208;aldehydes with potential application as precursors for derivatization to pharmaceuticals such as (R)&#8208;Baclofen or Pregabalin. Methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate as an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester has been rarely studied in hydroformylation, particularly with regard to a parameter screening for reaction optimization. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate to the desired &#946;&#8208;aldehyde utilizing a phosphine&#8208;free Rh catalyst was investigated with a focus on identification of parameters with a significant effect on regioselectivity and selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde amongst all products. Initially, reaction time, solvent, and catalyst loading were screened, followed by a reaction optimization using design of experiments (DoE). The reaction output was analyzed in relation to pressure, temperature and CO/H2 composition revealing that while either regioselectivity or overall selectivity (termed selectivity) can attain high values, none of the conditions leads to optimal levels of both regioselectivity and selectivity. As predicted by the model, the experimental results under two different conditions demonstrated excellent regioselectivity (96&#8201;%) with medium selectivity (57&#8201;%) and high selectivity (78&#8201;%) with good regioselectivity (93&#8201;%). Expansion of the substrate scope to substituted methyl cinnamate derivatives showed significant influence of the substituents and, thus, their electronic effects on regioselectivity and selectivity.

         <title>An Approach to Functionalization of Cucurbit[n]uril Through a Tetrahydrothiopheno Equatorial Substituent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of a tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril provides an avenue to reactive derivatization. This process extends the potential for future applications of the cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. Also highlighted are new glycoluril derivatives that may serve as precursors in the synthesis of cucurbit[n]uril or their analogues.







Abstract
A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbene coupling reactions are highly valued strategies for the assembly of complex molecules. Among various carbene precursors, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;N&#8208;tosylhydrazones have emerged as promising candidates in such reactions. In this study, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbene coupling reaction involving &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, arylboronates and alcohols. This approach provides a complementary method for the efficient synthesis of alkyl enol ethers, showcasing a broad substrate scope and favorable yields. Additionally, the subsequent transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility and versatility of this protocol.

         <title>High Throughput Experimentation as a Tool to Guide the Microwave Assisted Catalytic Amidation of Aryl Amines with Aryl Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized DoE, HTE and microwave synthesis to develop a catalytic amidation protocol that follows the principles of green chemistry through use of catalysis to improve atom economy, biorenewable solvent, high substrate loadings and energy efficient microwave heating.







Abstract
The formation of amides is one of the most essential transformations in the pharmaceutical industry, but most synthetic procedures include the use of stoichiometric poor atom economy reagents. These limitations are often compounded when condensing aryl amines with aryl acids due to their inherently low reactivity. To overcome such hurdles, we utilized high throughput experimentation to screen 640 different reaction conditions to find a suitable catalyst and solvent for benzamide formation. Based on those initial findings, we developed an efficient catalytic transformation of aryl amines with aryl acids into N&#8208;arylbenzamides using a 15&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading of 2,4&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl boronic acid and trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide in 2&#8208;MeTHF under microwave conditions for 1&#8197;h in the presence of 3&#8197;&#197; molecular sieves. Our method shows that even sterically hindered amines and carboxylic acids can be converted to the corresponding N&#8208;arylbenzamides, including previously reported unreactive aromatic and secondary amines, in good to excellent yields. This approach follows the principles of green chemistry through use of[1] catalysis to improve atom economy,[2] a biorenewable solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF),[3] high substrate loadings (0.5&#8197;M), and[4] energy efficient microwave heating.

         <title>User&#8208;friendly and Green Procedure for a Photoinduced Wohl&#8208;Ziegler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and ecofriendly catalyst&#8208;free allylic and benzylic bromination method using a stoichiometric amount of NBS under LEDs light irradiation is described. This method provides an alternative to the Wohl&#8208;Ziegler procedure which is classically performed in the presence of a radical initiator in the banned solvent CCl4. The method is applicable to a wide range of substrates, is easily scalable and is carried out at room temperature under air atmosphere. No special equipment other than the LEDs lamp is needed.







Abstract
A convenient Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination protocol using NBS under visible light in standard laboratory glassware is described. The monobromination reaction is efficient and selective over a wide range of substrates. Unlike previous studies, we prove that the use of a photocatalyst is unnecessary. The proposed protocol is simple to implement and applicable at the gram scale. The reaction takes place in a few tens of minutes at room temperature and offers an alternative to the use of CCl4, which is conventionally used for Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination. Alternative conditions of bromination by CBr4 in the presence of a photocatalyst have also been investigated.

         <title>O&#8208;C Glycoside Rearrangement through Time&#8208;Controlled Electrochemical Flow Strategy: Switching between Kinetics and Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report time&#8208;controlled O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement in flow&#8208;electrochemical microreactors, focusing on kinetic and thermodynamic selectivity. The selective synthesis of phenolic O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides has been explored using O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement. We investigated the time&#8208;control of O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement using a flow microreactor, which allows for second&#8208;scale reaction control. The electrochemical approach demonstrated that shortening the residence time leads to the selective synthesis of O&#8208;glycosides, while longer times favor the formation of C&#8208;glycosides. Kinetic studies revealed that substituents on the phenol ring affect the rate of O&#8208;glycoside formation and its rearrangement to C&#8208;glycosides. Finally, continuous flow synthesis was demonstrated, showcasing the scalability and utility of this method for producing bioactive substances.

         <title>Diving into the Shielding Surfaces: Construction of Atropisomeric Axes via Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed and synthesized a diverse library of atropisomeric molecular systems using a scaffold hopping strategy based on the GBB&#8208;3CR. Structural and computational analyses revealed key CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, aromatic shielding effects, and conformational dynamics, providing insights into their potential biological relevance.







Abstract
The CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, characterized by a CH group acting as a hydrogen bond donor and &#960; electrons serving as the acceptor, shares structural similarities with hydrogen bond and plays a significant role in a multitude of molecular systems. However, due to the weak and variable nature of these interactions, they remain poorly understood. Recently, we reported the design of high rotational barrier atropisomeric systems incorporating CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Building on these insights, we explored the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) to access additional atropisomeric systems. We hypothesized that the GBB&#8208;derived scaffold could serve as a modular platform, facilitating the strategic incorporation of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions to enhance structural diversity and functionality. Using 2&#8208;aminopyridine, polyaromatic aldehydes and ortho&#8208;substituted phenyl isocyanides, we systematically explored the substrate scope. We investigated the impact of different shelves and arms, emphasizing the effect of aromatic ring topology and number on molecular conformations and ring currents. To analyze experimental NMR signals of methyl groups, we calculated the chemical shifts and estimated the ring current contributions. The through&#8208;space NMR shielding calculations and isochemical shielding surface (ICSS) visualizations provided insights into the electronic environments within the scaffold, advancing our understanding of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and their potential applications.

         <dc:description>
A samarium diiodide/samarium&#8208;mediated direct deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes with hydroborate ester has been reported. In this method, unactivated aldehydes and hydroborate ester have been employed as starting materials for the synthesis of primary alkyl borate esters. Broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance have demonstrated that this is a robust method for deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here an effective, mild and practical approach to stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides by cost&#8208;effective chromium catalysis. This reaction was promoted by inexpensive CrCl2&#160;combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri&#8208;substituted&#160;Z&#8208;fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility to a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to&#160;Z&#8208;alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of beta&#8208;fluoride atoms.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homocoupling of terminal alkynes is a key approach for constructing 1,3&#8208;diynes , typically relying on copper&#8208;based bimetallic systems. Herein, we have developed a catalytic system based on nickel chloride, using 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand and air as the oxidant, which successfully enables the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Indazole Synthesis from &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters via Aryne Trapping: A Streamlined Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indazoles are high value chemical building blocks used in medicinal chemistry and materials science for their distinct structural and functional features. This study details a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between various aryl&#8208;ketodiazoesters and ortho&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates under mild conditions, leading predominantly to 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles. N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates were also observed as other products. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable synthetic approach. Mechanistic insights, derived from control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the products. Collectively, these findings underscore the method&#8217;s potential for synthesizing complex indazole derivatives, which hold significant promises for applications in pharmaceutical development and advanced materials research.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc (II) Imidoyl Azide Coordination Polymer, an Unexpected Compound with Insensitive Explosive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of coordination polymer has been discovered while looking for high&#8208;performance, insensitive secondary explosives. This polymer made of scarce imidoyl azide structures, demonstrates interesting pyrotechnic characteristics like a density greater than 2.00&#8197;g.cm&#8722;3 and great insensitivity towards thermal and mechanical stresses. The observation of such an intermediate shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and provides insight into the discovery of new energetic coordination polymers.







Abstract
A wide interest has recently been shown for the use of the tetrazole ring structures in the preparation of insensitive high&#8208;energy materials. Tetrazoles provide a perfect balance between insensitivity and explosive performances and several synthetic routes are available to generate such compounds in high yields. When studying the two&#8208;step synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA), suggested by Shreeve et&#8197;al., an unexpected intermediate structure was observed. This stable intermediate in aqueous conditions, reacted with hydrochloric acid to generate the desired tetrazole heterocycle suggesting the existence of a scarce organozinc imidoyl azide compound, also coined &#8220;open tetrazole&#8221;. This unusually stable structure is exceptionally isolated as a solid. Furthermore, the possibility of zinc ions coordinating several organic imidoyl azide molecules at the same time, creates a sparse and unprecedented coordination polymer. This new polymeric intermediate is revealed in the synthesis of BTMNA when the starting material, the iminodiacetonitrile (IDA), reacts with sodium azide in water with the assistance of zinc chloride. The intermediate was characterized by Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The observation of such unprecedented intermediates shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and broadens the understanding of the formation and potential use of organic zinc imidoyl azide coordination polymers as insensitive explosives.

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Driven Organophosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Iododifluoroalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalysed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed without the need for additional base. This reaction demonstrates compatibility with a variety of iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides to provide a concise and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides, which could be readily transformed into the corresponding multisubstituted alkenes of great importance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalyzed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed, eliminating the need for additional metal catalysts and bases. This protocol enables the efficient and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides under mild conditions, demonstrating excellent tolerance to iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytic phosphine functions not only as a Lewis base, forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex with difluoroalkyl iodides through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions to generate Rf radicals, but also as a halogen transfer shuttle catalyst to facilitate the catalytic cycle.

The biomass pyrolysis product levoglucosenone enables the preparation of the feeding modulator 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;arabino&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and the diastereomer 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone. The key steps involve a diastereoselective bromination using an enamine bromination&#8208;hydrolysis strategy on the bicyclic ring&#8208;system followed by selective nucleophilic displacements with benzoate giving access to both diastereomers. The outcomes of the displacement are rationalized by the involvement of oxirane intermediates.







Abstract
The feeding modulator 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;arabino&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and the diastereomer 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone have been prepared from the biomass pyrolysis product Cyrene (dihydrolevoglucoseone). The arabino&#8208;configured lactone was accessed via the diastereoselective bromination of Cyrene, through an enamine&#8208;bromination/hydrolysis strategy, giving the thermodynamically stable equatorial bromide after a base catalyzed equilibration. A Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation and then reaction with benzoate followed by hydrolysis gave the target lactone. 3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone was accessible via the reaction of the bromide with benzoate prior to Baeyer&#8208;Villiger reaction resulting in the retention of configuration. The diastereoselectivity for the reactions and the formation of byproducts was rationalized by the involvement of an intermediate oxirane and subsequent House&#8208;Meinwald rearrangements.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfurization of Thioamides under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. This contribution described the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides under hydrosilylation, the transformation being driven by blue light irradiation at ambient conditions. Well&#8208;defined Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions to promote selectively the reduction of thioamides furnishing the corresponding amines via the sole cleavage of the C=S bond. (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields)







Abstract
Up to now, there were only few reports on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed reductions of thioamides, one of the explanation of this scarcity being the possible metallic catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of species containing sulfur. In this contribution, we report the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of tertiary thioamides under hydrosilylation conditions at ambient temperature, the reaction being driven by blue light irradiation. To perform selectively the reduction of thioamides leading to amines (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields), highlighting the sole cleavage of the C=S bond, Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Cycloadditions to Prepare Isooxazoline&#8208;Fused Furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component [4+2]/[3+2] sequential cycloadditions of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM), nitrile N&#8208;oxides and furans is developed for the synthesis of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters in good yields and high diastereoselectivity. The method features high reaction orders in the three&#8208;component reaction.







Abstract
A variety of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters were prepared in 40&#8201;%&#8208;87&#8201;% yields with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The control experimental results revealed that the reaction underwent in the order of [4+2] cycloaddition and sequential [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM) generated from 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines, furans, and nitrile N&#8208;oxides generated from hydroxamoyl chlorides. The present method features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high diastereoselectivity of four stereocenters, and novel scaffolds of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines.

&lt;p&gt;A base-promoted three-component [4+2]/[3+2] sequential cycloadditions of aza-ortho-quinone methides (ao-QM), nitrile &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides and furans is developed for the synthesis of isooxazoline-fused furo[3,2-b]quinolines containing four stereocenters in good yields and high diastereoselectivity. The method features high reaction orders in the three-component reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of isooxazoline-fused furo[3,2-b]quinolines containing four stereocenters were prepared in 40&#8201;%-87&#8201;% yields with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The control experimental results revealed that the reaction underwent in the order of [4+2] cycloaddition and sequential [3+2] cycloaddition between aza-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides (ao-QM) generated from 2-chloromethyl anilines, furans, and nitrile &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides generated from hydroxamoyl chlorides. The present method features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high diastereoselectivity of four stereocenters, and novel scaffolds of isooxazoline-fused furo[3,2-b]quinolines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Successors of SmI2: Next Generation Metal, Photo and Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Reductive Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SmI2 is a celebrated reductant to perform numerous challenging reductions and reductive coupling reactions. Nevertheless, stoichiometric nature of SmI2 reactions motivated to develop alternative and more sustainable synthetic methods. Many of these methods are developed on the principle of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET).







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a pivotal role in generating radical intermediates which are pillars of constructing complex molecular structure. Since the introduction by Kagan, SmI2 played a key role in the single electron transfer mediated reductive transformations. Despite significant applications of SmI2 in high profile synthesis of natural products, usage of SmI2 was discoursed due to high molecular weight of reagent, less solubility and most importantly stoichiometric nature of the reactions. Recent years have witnessed a renaissance in photo&#8208;and electro&#8208;catalytic reactions which are more sustainable in nature. A handful of these reactions showed the potential to replace SmI2 as more sustainable and greener alternative. This prospective article aims to demonstrate potential reducing systems to replace the use of SmI2.

         <title>Monomers with Spirocyclic Acetal units for Synthesis of Sustainable and Recyclable Polymers with Improved Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;functional molecules with spirocyclic acetal structures have recently emerged as attractive monomers to prepare high&#8208;performance polymers, which may subsequently be de&#8208;polymerized and recycled under specific physicochemical conditions. Spirocyclic acetal structures can be formed by condensation of a suitable aldehyde or ketone with a polyol so that the functionalities necessary for the polymerization are retained. In general, rigid spirocyclic acetal units efficiently enhance the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg). This typically increases, e.g., the stiffness and use temperature of the materials. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of spirocyclic acetal units to acidic conditions may be utilized to develop polymers that may be conveniently and selectively cleaved into, e.g., monomers or oligomers under controlled acidic conditions. This opens up opportunities for making new chemically recyclable polymers and plastics. Herein, we highlight the recent progress in molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures and their use for the design and preparation of chemically recyclable high&#8208;Tg polymers. Monomers and polymers with the potential to be derived from sustainable biobased resources are given special attention.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8211;catalyzed highly regioselective ortho&#8211;hydroxylation of N&#8211;nitrosoanilines has been developed, utilizing tert&#8211;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxyl source.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regiospecific ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines utilizing tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the hydroxylating source. The reaction proceeds through N&#8208;nitroso group directed C&#8722;H activation and subsequent hydroxylation at the ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provides a mild, operationally straightforward, and high&#8208;yielding transformation, offering a valuable tool for the construction of ortho&#8208;hydroxylated aniline derivatives, which are important intermediates in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry.

         <dc:description>
An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed.







Abstract
An efficient and operational [4+1] annulation strategy toward functional dihydrobenzofurans from 2&#8208;bromomalonates and in&#8197;situ generated alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines) has been developed. Without the need for pre&#8208;dried solvent and inert atmosphere protection, a broad range of substituted propargylamines are well&#8208;tolerated, producing the expected alkynyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans with good to high yields. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and valuable alkenyl/carboxylated dihydrobenzofurans construction were conducted to provide a great potential value in medicinal chemistry and other related disciplines.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed, Thermally Driven [2&#960;+2&#960;]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Olefins and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally&#8208;driven, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions provide a scalable and atom&#8208;efficient strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Complementary to established photochemical methods, they tolerate electronically unbiased substrates, thereby broadening synthetic possibilities for these valuable building blocks and addressing limitations of traditional approaches. The current review summarises the concepts behind this transformation and updates the reader with the most recent advances.







Abstract
The [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of olefins and alkynes stands out as a versatile and atom&#8208;economical strategy for synthesizing cyclobutane and cyclobutene building blocks, which are challenging to access through other synthetic methods. While photochemical approaches have traditionally dominated this field, thermally&#8208;driven methods employing transition metals offer distinct advantages, including decreased reliance on pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and improved scalability. This review explores the underlying principles of metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and highlights recent advances in thermally&#8208;driven approaches for the efficient synthesis of cyclobutane and cyclobutene frameworks. Particular attention is given to electronically unbiased substrates, which remain a significant challenge for photochemical approaches.

         <title>Regioelective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh&#160;catalyst sample named [HRh(PPh3)4] due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh&#160;catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Borrowing Hydrogen/Cyclization Synthesis of Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) with Salen, organic nitrogen hydroxyl groups efficiently catalyze the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of benzimidazoles from nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are an efficient toolbox of access to complex compounds, but the development of multicomponent reactions involved in benzimidazole synthesis is still limited. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction involving nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide was developed for the synthesis of benzimidazoles employing Co&#8208;complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) as catalyst, which by self&#8208;assembly from salen ligands, organic nitrogen hydroxyl compounds, and CoCl2. Compared with previously reported three&#8208;component methods for the construction of benzimidazoles, this method involves a novel hydrogen borrowing/cyclization and can provide a variety of benzimidazole in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Chemical and Biosynthetic Evolution of Quadrane and Related Sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the evolution of biosynthetic enzymes, the bioactivity&#8208;relevant chemical space of natural products has been significantly expanded. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in elucidating the intriguing chemical and biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds including humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, offering opportunities to discover novel sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.







Abstract
Natural products, with their potent bioactivities and selectivities, significantly benefit human health and agriculture. The evolution of biosynthetic enzymes of natural products has greatly expanded their chemical space relevant to bioactivity. Insights from natural evolution provide valuable guidance for engineering these enzymes to create molecules with novel structures and bioactivities. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds, indicating evolutionary relationships among sesquiterpene scaffolds such as humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, rooted in their biosynthetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of these sesquiterpenoids. These findings illuminate the logic behind the chemical and biosynthetic evolution of sesquiterpenes and offer opportunities to discover new sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here we show that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate (DAP) and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen. The reaction occurs in minutes at 0&#9472;50 oC to convert carboxylic acids to acyl amidophosphate intermediates, which then undergo nitrite&#8208;promoted hydrolysis to give the corresponding acyl phosphates. The partial overlap in scope with important metabolic carboxylates and the concentrated acidic conditions likely limit its direct applicability in metabolic origins of life scenarios. Nonetheless, the work represents a step forward in understanding nonenzymatic carboxylate phosphorylation and helps clarify how the transformation might eventually be rendered compatible with a protometabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Regiodivergent Synthesis of Functionalized Maleimides and Itaconimides via in&#8208;situ Generated Pyridinium Ylide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent approach for the synthesis of maleimides and itaconimides using pyridinium ylides. This method ensures broad substrate compatibility and excellent reproducibility.







Abstract
We report a temperature&#8208;dependent regiodivergent synthetic strategy for the construction of functionalized maleimides and itaconimides using in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylides. This approach enables efficient access to both regioisomeric products under mild and straightforward reaction conditions. A variety of pyridinium salts with different aromatic and alkyl groups were successfully used with N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl succinimides demonstrating broad substrate compatibility. The practicality and scalability of this methodology were confirmed through scale&#8208;up experiments, which maintained high yields and reproducibility.

         <title>A New Approach Towards the Synthesis of Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Using &#945;&#8208;Diazoesters and Hydrazide Catalysed by Cu(I) Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy for the preparation of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst is reported. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilising any other metal catalyst, the unexpected imine bond formation between the terminal nitrogen of hydrazide and carbene carbon was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide.







Abstract
Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in pure form and fully characterized them using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis.

         <title>Modulating Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Oligothiophenes via Subtle Changes in Donnor &#8208; Acceptor Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligothiophenes varying by their donor&#8208;acceptor sequences and displaying distinct optical and electrochemical properties were synthesized by playing with the different reactivity of &#945; and &#945;&#8217; positions of 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis and electronic properties of oligothiophenes derived from the 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene building block. By exploiting the differential reactivity of thiophene's &#945;&#8208;positions, regioisomeric derivatives were synthesized with varying donor&#8211;acceptor sequences. These derivatives displayed distinct optical and electrochemical characteristics based on the relative positions of cyano acceptor and hexyloxy donor groups. Spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical analyses revealed that substituent placement critically affects electronic properties, such as HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and band gaps. The introduction of alkoxy groups at external &#946;&#8208;sites promoted coupling reactions upon oxidation, leading to polymerization or dimerization. Conversely, cyano groups at these positions stabilized radical cations and dications, suppressing further reactions. These findings offer insights into designing conjugated systems with tunable properties, emphasizing the importance of substituent positioning for optimizing performance.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Alkyne&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition to Access Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was introduced for constructing chiral biaryls using Cu catalytic system facilitated by chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridged box ligand, using dialkynyl diaryls and azides as raw materials. This protocol offers notable advantages: simple operation, mild condition, good functional group tolerance, high yields, and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls are an important class of structural units widely used in natural product synthesis, drug design, and as ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Although significant progress has been made in the synthesis of axially chiral biaryls, some of them are still limited to narrow substrate ranges, low efficiency, and moderate stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a highly efficient route to prepare atropisomeric biaryls with triazole and alkyne modules through the desymmetrization of prochiral dialkynyl diaryls utilizing chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridge box ligands in conjunction with copper salts. The process has mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can obtain a wide array of valuable axially chiral biaryl derivatives with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Deuterodichloromethylation of Olefins Using Silacarboxylic Acids as Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed deuterodichloromethylation of olefins was developed to afford deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes in good yields. Readily accessible silacarboxylic acids were employed as halogen&#8208;atom transfer reagents and deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced deuterodichloromethylation of alkenes was developed with readily available and inexpensive deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent. Silacarboxylic acids, which could generate silyl radicals through efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation, were applied as halogen atom transfer agents. A series of deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Dioxygenation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes to Generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>
