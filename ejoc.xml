         <title>A scalable high&#8208;yielding and selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling &#8208; a key step for the synthesis of trans&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the&#160;  trans&#8208;  stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted&#160;  trans&#8208;  stilbenes, that revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#160;g (&gt;&#160;1000&#160; &#180; &#160;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90%. The inhibitorcandidate&#160;  DC10  &#160;[(  E  )&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities ( &#187; 33 g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled&#8208;up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on a &gt;100&#8208;gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Michael Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Branched Aryl Acetaldehydes with Nitroolefins Promoted by Squaric Amino Acid Derived Bifunctional Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>

&#945;&#8208;Branched aryl acetaldehydes are efficiently activated by a cinchona based squaric acid&#8208;derived peptide to provide, upon reaction with nitroolefins, 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted syn &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Here we describe a direct access to 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted syn &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes by addition of &#945;&#8208;branched aryl acetaldehydes to nitroolefins promoted by a cinchona based squaric acid&#8208;derived amino acid peptide. Different &#945;&#8208;methyl arylacetaldehydes react with &#946;&#8208;aromatic and &#946;&#8208;alkyl nitroolefins to afford the Michael adducts in high enantioselectivity and syn&#8208;selectivity. NMR experiments and DFT calculations predict the reaction to occur through the intermediacy of E&#8208;enolate. The interaction between the substrates and the catalyst follows P&#225;pai's model, wherein an intramolecular H&#8208;bond interaction in the catalyst between the NH group of one of the tert&#8208;leucines and the squaramide oxygen seems to be key for discrimination of the corresponding reaction transition states.

         <title>Quinoline&#8208;Based Silylium Ions: Synthesis, Structure and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 25, Page 33612-33620, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New quinoline silylium cations have been prepared and their structure unambiguously determined through extensive NMR studies supported by DFT calculations. The Lewis acidity of these silyl cations stabilized by internal Lewis basic sites has been estimated.







Abstract
Heteroarylsilyl cations elaborated from a quinoline skeleton have been prepared from the corresponding silanes, and their structures were studied by 1H, 29Si, and 15N NMR. DOSY experiments and DFT calculations were also carried out which showed that the silyl cation center is stabilized intramolecularly by the quinoline nitrogen atom (N1), forming a highly strained and quasi planar 4&#8208;membered ring. Oxygenated and nitrogenated substituents at the C4 position on the quinoline ring were shown to reinforce the Si&#8722;N1 interaction through a p&#8208;&#960; conjugation. The Lewis acidity of this class of silylium was finally determined using M&#252;ller's nitrilium method.

         <title>Dimeric Indenofluorene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Motif for Enhanced Intramolecular Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 25, Page 33536-33543, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (IF&#8208;TTFs) with acetylenic bridging units were prepared by stepwise acetylenic coupling reactions. A strong propensity to undergo intramolecular stacking of the two IF&#8208;TTF units was observed spectroscopically for both the neutral and oxidized species. Electrocrystallization provided a solid, semi&#8208;conducting material where each IF&#8208;TTF unit is oxidized to its radical cation.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) is a redox&#8208;active compound, which reversibly undergoes two one&#8208;electron oxidations to give stable species. Several features of TTF, such as redox and optical properties as well as geometry and self&#8208;associating nature, can be tuned by extension of the conjugated system with an aromatic linker such as an indenofluorene (IF) moiety. In this work we present the synthesis of a novel dimeric scaffold of IF&#8208;extended TTF (IF&#8208;TTF) in which the units are linked by a rigid 1,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne moiety. 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that the scaffold is highly prone to form intramolecular IF&#8208;TTF dimer complexes even in the neutral form, and stable radical cation species were formed in solution upon chemical oxidation with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (&#8216;magic blue&#8217;). Electrocrystallization of the rigid scaffold yielded a semi&#8208;conducting material, which proved to be stable at ambient temperature and air.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Mediated Nucleophilic Functionalization of Amides through Stable Amide C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage; One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 25, Page 33568-33571, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TFA mediated general and simple synthetic protocol to directly cleave stable amide C&#8722;N bonds by a variety of alcohol and amine nucleophiles has been developed. Natural alcohols such as menthol and cholesterol took part in the reaction under the present reaction conditions to generate the desired esters. Structurally important 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazole derivatives have been synthesized in one pot employing 2&#8208;aminothiophenol as nucleophile.







Abstract
We have developed a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated synthetic method to directly cleave stable amide C&#8722;N bonds by a variety of alcohol and amine nucleophiles. Reverse reactivity was observed and alcoholysis of amides by activated primary and secondary benzylic, and propargylic alcohols have been achieved instead of the expected nucleophilic substitution of alcohols. As an application, 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazole derivatives have been synthesized in one pot employing 2&#8208;aminothiophenol as nucleophile.

&lt;p&gt;A TFA mediated general and simple synthetic protocol to directly cleave stable amide C&#8722;N bonds by a variety of alcohol and amine nucleophiles has been developed. Natural alcohols such as menthol and cholesterol took part in the reaction under the present reaction conditions to generate the desired esters. Structurally important 2-substituted benzothiazole derivatives have been synthesized in one pot employing 2-aminothiophenol as nucleophile.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated synthetic method to directly cleave stable amide C&#8722;N bonds by a variety of alcohol and amine nucleophiles. Reverse reactivity was observed and alcoholysis of amides by activated primary and secondary benzylic, and propargylic alcohols have been achieved instead of the expected nucleophilic substitution of alcohols. As an application, 2-substituted benzothiazole derivatives have been synthesized in one pot employing 2-aminothiophenol as nucleophile.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Highly Congested Dioxapyrenophane from an Attempted Synthesis of the Highly&#8208;Strained 1,1,6,6&#8208;Tetramethyl[6](2,11)teropyrenophane</title>

         <dc:description>
Four methyl groups have been squeezed onto the bridges of the 2,11&#8208;dioxa[3.3]metacyclophane substructure of a structurally unusual dioxa(1,3)pyrenophane, which was formed with remarkable ease as a potential precursor for the synthesis of [6](2,11)teropyrenophane.







Abstract
Synthetic studies aimed at the synthesis of 1,1,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl[6](2,11)teropyrenophane (3&#8201;a) led to the synthesis of the structurally unusual dioxa[6.3.3](7,1,3)pyrenophane 29. The strategic approach to access 3&#8201;a resembled the one that was successfully applied in the synthesis of the higher homologues 3&#8201;b&#8208;e, but had a key difference: three&#8208;atom bridges were utilized instead of two&#8208;atom bridges in the construction of the intermediate pyrenophanes which were slated to serve as precursors to access 3&#8201;a. After stepwise approaches to construct the bridges failed, it was found that two ether bridges could be installed easily in the same reaction to afford dioxa[6.3.3](7,1,3)pyrenophane 29. Considerable steric congestion around the dioxa[3.3]metacyclophane substructure arises from the presence of a methyl group on each of the benzylic positions of the three&#8208;atom bridges. Although the conversion of 29 into a [6](2,11)teropyrenophane was unsuccessful, the finding that ether bridges in this structurally uncommon dioxacyclophane could be formed easily offers new opportunities for the synthesis of related cyclophanes that may ultimately serve as viable precursors for the synthesis of [n](2,11)teropyrenophanes.

The Front Cover shows the structure of a molecule containing two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units separated by an acetylenic linker that allows the redox&#8208;active units to intramolecularly associate when either neutral or oxidized. A semi&#8208;conducting salt of the dicationic molecule was obtained by electrocrystallization using an H&#8208;shaped cell. The cover picture was designed by Viktor Bliksted Roug Pedersen.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Dehydrocostus Lactone by Domino Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Domino metathesis of the acyclic substrates 2 and 3 prepared by asymmetric anti aldol reactions gave access to suitably functionalized carbobicyclic cores of (&#8722;)&#8208;dehydrocostus lactone (1). Subsequent transformation of these hydroazulenes to triol 4 by multiple hydroboration/oxidation installed three out of four stereogenic centers of the target sesquiterpenoid 1 in a single step and paved the way for lactonization. Late&#8208;stage double carbonyl olefination in good yield was finally achieved after masking the &#947;&#8208;lactone as an acetal.







Abstract
An efficient total synthesis of the sesquiterpenoid (&#8722;)&#8208;dehydrocostus lactone is reported. Our earlier approach by a domino enediyne metathesis was extended by a domino dienyne metathesis strategy to give access to suitably functionalized hydroazulene cores. Highly stereoselective asymmetric anti aldol reactions provided the enantiopure substrates for this key step of our synthesis. Multiple hydroboration/oxidation of the resulting hydroazulenes set up three out of four stereogenic centers in a single step. First, oxidation to give a diketo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone enabled an enantioselective formal synthesis of the target guaianolide. Subsequently, the final steps of this approach were improved by using a double carbonyl olefination at the stage of a masked &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, which completed the synthesis in a much more efficient way.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides to [60]Fullerene: Thermodynamic Control of Bis&#8208;Addition with Ionic Liquids Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 25, Page 33544-33550, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene has been performed in the presence of ionic liquids and under microwave (MW) dielectric heating. As confirmed by DFT calculations, a converging kinetic and thermodynamic control favors the selective formation of the less sterically hindered and most stable bis&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine regioisomers.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene (C60) has been studied in ortho&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) by evaluating the impact of an ionic liquid (IL) additive. The solvent effect has been addressed by evaluating the activation parameters of the cycloaddition and the boosting effect of the microwave (MW) induced dielectric heating. The IL additive plays a twofold role of stabilizing the dipolar ylide intermediate and favoring the retro&#8208;cycloaddition at high temperature regime. Under the conditions explored, a combined kinetic and thermodynamic preference favors the selective formation of trans bis&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine regioisomers, in agreement with the DFT computational analysis.

The Cover Feature shows a kaleidoscopic vision of the frontier empty orbitals of [60]fulleropyrrolidine embracing diverse [6,6] bonds, which poses a severe regioselectivity challenge for further ylide cycloaddition, resulting in a multitude of polyfunctionalization products. A combined kinetic and mechanistic study is reported to interrogate the thermodynamic drivers, leading to stable fulleropyrrolidine bis&#8208;adducts, using MW&#8208;assisted heating and ionic liquids additives.

         <title>Di&#8208; and Trifluorinated 2&#8208;Azidobenzimidazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Photooxygenation, and 19F NMR Prediction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 25, Page 33572-33577, July 7, 2021. </description>

Irradiation in the presence of N&#8208;protected amino acids at 300&#8197;nm (Rayonet) affords fluorinated arylesters by oxygenation of the 6&#8208;position in good to excellent yields and perfect regioselectivity. Even with the most suitable method investigated (&#969;B97XD/TApr&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ), deviations of up to 5&#8197;ppm from the experimental values were observed, underlining the importance of experimental measurements.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of a series of hitherto unknown, multiply fluorinated 2&#8208;azidobenzimidazole derivatives was investigated. The synthesis of the starting material includes regioselective p&#8208;defluorination of nitrobenzene derivatives employing Ogoshi's conditions. If the 6&#8208;position was unsubstituted, irradiation in the presence of N&#8208;protected amino acids at 300&#8197;nm (Rayonet) led to the formation of arylesters by oxygenation of the 6&#8208;position in good to excellent yields and perfect regioselectivity. We did not observe any displacement of fluoride. If the 6&#8208;position itself was fluorinated, alternative positions of the benzene portion were attacked. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds through ring opening of the singlet nitrene to the cyanodiimine or via the iminobenzimidazolium ion. The availability of a set of fluorinated photo&#8208;adducts prompted the quantum chemical calculation of their 19F NMR chemical shifts. Even with the most suitable method investigated (&#969;B97XD/TApr&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ), deviations of up to 5&#8197;ppm from the experimental values were observed, underlining the importance of experimental measurements.

A novel design&#8208;based removable N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group based on commercially available 4&#8208;aminoantipyrine (AAP) is reported. Aromatic benzamides bearing the AAP directing group underwent efficient Ru&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond arylation reactions under mild reaction conditions and using [RuCl2(PPh3)3] as a catalyst. Various differently substituted and electronically different antipyrinyl (AP) benzamides participated in the Ru&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation reaction and in decent yields and with good functional group tolerance.

A multicomponent one&#8208;pot process led to the formation of diversely trisubstituted 2&#8208;iminothiazolines and disubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiazoles under aqueous conditions. Starting from isocyanides, amines, 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoacetophenones, and aqueous polysulfide solution or sulfur powder, this efficient procedure enabled the chromatography&#8208;free separation of solid products.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot aqueous reaction for the synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines and 2&#8208;aminothiazoles using isocyanides, amines, sulfur, and 2&#8242;&#8208;bromoacetophenones. The three&#8208;component preparation of thioureas is followed by the one&#8208;pot cyclization leading to the heterocyclic product. This efficient and mild procedure features excellent step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy and enables the chromatography&#8208;free preparation of diversely substituted 2&#8208;iminothiazoline and 2&#8208;aminothiazole derivatives.

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of pyrrole derivatives and related five membered azacycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrole derivatives and their related five membered azacycles are a class of important five&#8208;membered aromatic nitrogen heterocyclic compounds and their synthesis attracted much attention of organic chemists. Iron catalysis has been widely used in various organic transformations due to the benefits of their excellent catalytic activity, their environmentally benign character, their easy accessibility and their low price. Over the past decades, a variety of facile and effective synthesis of pyrrole derivatives and related five membered azacycles based on iron catalysis has been reported. In this review, a comprehensive coverage of the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of pyrrole derivatives and their related five membered azacycles was summerized, which covered the literatures up to March 2021.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a general two&#8208;step procedure to access hitherto unknown and under explored 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinamidoximes from 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopyridines and a wide range of easily available and bench&#8208;stable terminal alkynes, using Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, as the first step. The generation of the polar amidoxime group is realized at a late&#8208;stage upon treatment of the alkynylfluorocyanopyridine by hydroxylamine. This mild and operationally simple two&#8208;step room temperature process is compatible with enantiopure chiral substrates and various&#160; functionality including free alcohols, unprotected and CBz&#8208;protected amines, acetonides, benzyl ethers, amide, imide, di&#8208;subsituted alkynes and strained saturated heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of N&#8208;Pyridylindole Leading to Fused Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper catalyzed aerobic oxidation enables the tandem selective and efficient transformation of N&#8208;pyridylindole for the construction of 11H&#8208;pyrido[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;11&#8208;ones. The reaction shows good efficiency to accomplish the aerobic oxidation. Mechanistic investigation indicated the facile oxidation of N&#8208;pyridylindole underwent the single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer oxidation, the capture of molecular oxygen and the extrusion of carbon monoxide to deliver the desired 11H&#8208;pyrido[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;11&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Biophysical Approaches to Allosteric Modulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since its discovery, allostery has emerged as a pivotal regulatory mechanism involved in many diverse biological processes. In this minireview, we present an overview of allostery models postulated through the years. In addition, we provide the description of useful computational and experimental approaches developed to study such a crucial process at the molecular level, followed by four representative case studies.







Abstract
Allosteric regulation, i.&#8201;e. the control exerted on an orthosteric site by an effector interacting at a distinct and distant site, represents a prime example of a precise tuning system of several key biological processes like gene transcription, cell adhesion and, most importantly, signal transduction. Since its discovery sixty years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been extensively investigated. The aim of this minireview is to introduce the reader to the topic of protein allostery. In particular, we briefly overview the allosteric models postulated over the years and we describe the most relevant chemical and biophysical approaches reported so far for the identification of putative allosteric sites and/or for the investigation of allosteric signal propagation throughout the protein. An outlook of the main computational and experimental methods is followed by four case studies representative of different proteins classes: enzymes, hub proteins, cell receptors, and intrinsically disordered proteins.

         <title>Recent Developments in Enantioselective Organocatalytic Cascade Reactions for the Construction of Halogenated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade reactions, either induced by halogenation or involving halogenated synthetic building blocks, have been utilized in recent years to obtain a variety of cyclic compounds, of interest for many applications. In this review the literature on enantioselective catalytic methods of synthesis is surveyed for the period 2014&#8211;2020.







Abstract
Chiral halogenated substances have many applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials, such as polymers, liquid crystals and as intermediates in synthesis. The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule can have a large effect in its properties; for instance, halogens are used in drugs to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability and absorption, and even the blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability. As highlighted in this review, there are nowadays a range of highly selective, versatile halogenating reagents, electrophilic, nucleophilic or radical in nature, which operate under mild conditions, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules in cascade reactions. Recent developments in organocatalyst design revealed novel Cinchona alkaloids derivatives, chiral phosphoric acids, amines, phosphines and several bifunctional catalysts, mostly thiourea&#8208; or squaramide&#8208;based, which introduced chirality, with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselection, in the formation of one or multiple chiral centers in a single synthetic operation, as shown. In this review we survey the literature published in this field from 2014 to 2020.

         <dc:description>The cyclohepta[  b  ]indole scaffold constitutes a salient structural motif in natural products as well as of men&#8208;made pharmaceutically active ingredients. Cyclohepta[  b  ]indoles consist of an indole nucleus fused to a seven&#8208;membered carbacycle. Interest in cyclohepta[  b  ]indole chemistry currently originates from natural product chemistry and medicinal chemistry. The chemistry of cyclohepta[  b  ]indole&#8208;based organic functional materials may be a research area of some future potential. The state of the art of cyclohepta[  b  ]indoloid chemism has been comprehensively and scholarly summarized by previous review articles.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Fullerene Tris&#8208;adducts for the Preparation of Clickable Fullerene [3&#8201;:&#8201;3]&#8208;Hexa&#8208;adduct Scaffolds</title>

The Front Cover shows a 3D&#8208;chess board illustrating strategies developed to introduce several addends onto the fullerene core in a regioselective manner. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;tethered macrocyclic bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;malonates have been used to functionalize C60 in multiple Bingel cyclopropanations. The bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene unit is not only a directing group for the cyclization step, it is also a protecting group that can be readily cleaved to afford valuable acyclic fullerene building blocks. These have been used to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents. More information can be found in the Full Paper and in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten et&#8197;al.

The Cover Feature shows the experimental and theoretical approach to the synthesis of polysubstituted furans, prevalent structural motifs in natural products, bioactive compounds or functional organic materials. A methodological study has shown that potassium tert&#8208;butoxide promotes the oxacyclization of Z&#8208;enynols leading to a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. At the same time, the analysis of natural populations by DFT calculations made it possible to rationalize the feasibility of this reaction. We would like to thank Mr Martin Gilardi for the creation of this drawing. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Thibonnet et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>An efficient and chemoselective synthesis of sulfoxides through the electrooxidation of sulfides has been well developed. This protocol takes advantage of electricity as the terminal oxidant and molecular oxygen and water as the oxygen atom source. A variety of&#160;structurally&#160;diverse sulfoxide compounds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields. The scale&#8208;up reactions at 6&#8208;20 mmol show the good practicability and application potential of this methodology.

         <title>Enzymatic synthesis of a series of thioglycosides, analogs of arbutin, owing efficient antipigmentation properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arbutin, a natural glycoside, is well known as a commercial tyrosinase inhibitor and thus to prevent pigmentary disorders of skin. Indeed, tyrosinase is involved in the biosynthesis of melanin, the skin main pigment. However, arbutin is subject to hydrolysis, which limits its bioactivity. In general, thioglycosides are known to be very resistant to both chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, which increases the interaction time with their biological targets. A biocatalytic approach allowed us to access to thioglycosidic analogs of arbutin in a green approach with good to excellent yields. Such compounds have then been tested as tyrosinase inhibitors and also as inhibitors of melanin transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This latter mechanism takes place via lectin (or lectin&#8208;like) receptors present on the cells surface. p&#8208;Aminophenyl &#223;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside appears to be an excellent candidate thanks to its tyrosinase inhibitory activity comparable to arbutin, while having the ability to interact with glycan receptors allowing to reduce melanin transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct nucleophilic substitution of alcohols using an immobilized oxovanadium catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct nucleophilic substitution of alcohols with thiols or carbon nucleophiles was achieved using a mesoporous silica&#8208;supported oxovanadium catalyst (VMPS4). Benzyl and allyl alcohols were compatible in this reaction under mild conditions, affording the products in high yields. The VMPS4 catalyst showed excellent chemoselectivity toward alcohols in the presence of acid&#8208;labile functional groups, which is in contrast to that observed for the commonly used Lewis acid catalysts, which exhibit poor selectivity. The VMPS4 catalyst could be recycled by simple centrifugation, and the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A simple and environmentally benign procedure for electrochemical oxidative mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenylation of the resveratrol C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bond was developed.

With satisfactory functional group compatibility, it required a substoichiometric amount of NaI, which acted as an electrolyte and mediator.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Photoredox Coupling: Alternative to Norrish Type II Reaction and Yang Cyclization in Ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the revisited photochemistry of butyrophenone. The bright sun and beautiful nature are symbolizing the photons as clean energy source. After excitation, pathways to wander downhill are standing for different deactivation route which the system can undergo. A new reaction pathway is reported. In addition to the Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization, intermolecular species are generated: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane and pinacols. They account for approx. 20% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The authors would like to thank the Provadis School (Frankfurt, emblem shown right) for making this work possible. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Hoffmann and M.&#8197;W.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Domino Processes Involving the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8722;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been studied computationally as well as experimentally. Key intermediates and transition states have been identified, which allow to improve the reaction conditions as well as to develop new transformations in the future.







Abstract
The detailed understanding of mechanisms is the basis to design new reactions. Herein, we studied the domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction developed in our laboratory computationally as well as by synthetic experiments, to characterize different pathways. A quinodimethane intermediate was identified as key structure, which is the basis for all subsequent transformations: Elimination to an aromatic naphthalene, rearrangement to a dihydroaminonaphthalene and a photo&#8208;induced ring opening. These insights allow to optimize the reaction conditions, such as catalytic utilization of amine, as well as to advance new reactions in the future.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Fullerene Tris&#8208;adducts for the Preparation of Clickable Fullerene [3:3]&#8208;Hexa&#8208;adduct Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic tris&#8208;malonate incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been used for the regioselective tris&#8208;functionalization of C60. Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. Further functionalization has been carried out to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.







Abstract
Macrocyclic tris&#8208;malonates incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been prepared by a stepwise approach and used for the regioselective tris&#8208;functionalization of C60. Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. The bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been cleaved to liberate the terminal alcohol functions of the fullerene tris&#8208;adduct. This key building block has been further functionalized to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.

         <title>Regioselective Preparation of Fullerene Bis&#8208;adducts from Cleavable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;malonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. Upon functionalization of the fullerene sphere, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating either di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene or tetra&#8208;iso&#8208;propyldisiloxane subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. By systematically changing the length and the rigidity of the spacer units linking the malonate moieties to the silylated protecting groups, fullerene bis&#8208;adducts with different addition patterns have been obtained. Finally, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.

         <title>Reactivity and Applications of Iodine Monochloride in Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for discovering new protocols to conduct reactions including halogenations, oxidations and cyclizations has recently led to a renaissance in studying reactions involving somewhat forgotten halogen&#8208;containing reactants. This Minireview documents the processes that have employed iodine monochloride, an intriguing, highly polarized compound composed of sole iodine and chlorine atoms.







Abstract
Over the last half&#8208;decade, routes towards accessing halogenated compounds of value such as bioactive pharmaceuticals, organic building blocks has been of interest to the synthetic community. The demand for new methodologies to access important compounds has surged over the period. Amongst the halogenating agents available in a chemist's toolbox, one reagent in particular, iodine monochloride (ICl), is relatively under employed in comparison to alternatives such as molecular iodine for example. In this Minireview, we document the most recent applications (2015&#8211;2020) of ICl in synthetic organic transformations, namely halogenations including iodinations and chlorination reactions, cyclizations, metathesis reactions as well as oxidation processes. Furthermore, its versatile nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the construction of racemic and enantiopure biaryl unnatural amino acid derivatives via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective sp3 C&#8208;H activation and arylation of amino acid derivatives with iodobiaryls. The synthesis of biaryl motif installed (DL&#8208;), L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acid derivatives including norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid with anti stereochemistry have been reported. The synthesis of alanine derivatives with two biaryl motifs and aminoalkanoic acids with biaryl motifs were also shown. The C&#8208;H arylation of enantiopure carboxamides gave biaryl amino acid derivatives with good enantiopurity. Removal of the directing group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline, deprotection of the phthalimide moiety and the preparation of biaryl amino acid derivatives containing free amino&#8208; and carboxylate groups were shown. The stereochemistry (anti) of representative major diastereomers was unequivocally ascertained from X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Biaryl amino acids/peptides are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, and this work therefore represents a contribution towards enriching the library of biaryl amino acids.</dc:description>

For the first time, various inactivated amides including secondary and tertiary amides were directly converted to the corresponding acid chlorides in one&#8208;step. The substrate scope of methyl esters including aromatic and aliphatic esters was also explored under this system. This method is&#160; simple, scalable and wide in scope, which provides an&#160; approach to preparation of these acid chlorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;-mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Automated synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi phosphorylated peptides are key tools in understanding the biological roles of protein phosphorylation patterns. In this work, we focused on multi phosphorylated peptides with over four, clustered, phosphorylation site that are termed herein heavily phosphorylated peptides (HPPs). The synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides is extremely difficult and requires the use of wide temperature range. Standard peptide synthesizers are incapable of both cooling and heating, which impedes the automated synthesis of those peptides. Here, we used the oligosaccharide synthesizer Glyconeer 2.1 to develop a protocol for the automated synthesis of heavily phosphorylated peptides. The Glyconeer 2.1 is able to both cool and heat, which enabled the development of highly controlled coupling and deprotection conditions that were used for the automated synthesis of four different heavily phosphorylated peptides with five or more, clustered, phosphorylation sites. Our approach paves the way for easy automated synthesis of a variety of heavily phosphorylated peptides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A tandem, one&#8208;pot, multicomponent reaction for direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides scaffolds with in&#8197;situ generated Michael acceptors are illustrated. The reaction proceeds under environmentally benign and straightforward conditions using visible light organo&#8208;photocatalysis and yields desired alkylated products with good yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Tandem, one&#8208;pot, multicomponent reaction for direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides scaffolds are illustrated. The basic nature of phosphoramide leads to a diverse set of in&#8197;situ generated Michael acceptors making the reactions highly atom and step economical. The reaction conditions are mild, entirely metal&#8208; and external additives free. Alkylated phosphoramides were obtained with good yields and selectivity using visible&#8208;light organo&#8208;photocatalysis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development in the area of acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) and borrowing hydrogen (BH) catalysis emerge as one of the potential tools for various C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions.

Initially, the area was developed by the use of noble metal catalysts. Recently, base metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni proved to be environmentally benign and inexpensive alternatives for the noble metals in the application of AD and BH methods.

         <title>Luminescent Imidazolium Salts as Bright Multi&#8208;Faceted Tools for Biology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium salts bearing fluorophore units can be easily tuned to encompass the desired properties to explore the biological world and provide tools for medicine. Luminescence allows anion detection and cell imaging, while antibacterial and anticancer activities are also reported, as well as drug and gene delivery when the amphipathic character of the salt is delicately controlled.







Abstract
Light and cognate phenomena, e.&#8201;g., luminescence are powerful tools endowed with great sensitivity to explore the infinitely small. Molecular salts, especially those based on imidazolium units, are granted with original properties and structural versatility. Associated with fluorophores, they constitute highly bioavailable platforms. Their interactions with negatively charged species and biological membranes as well as their controllable cytotoxicity imparted their applications as anion receptors, but also a promising potential as antibacterial and anticancer agents whose mechanism of action can be observed using luminescence, opening the possibility of theranostics (therapy and diagnosis). One of the other assets of imidazolium salts is their flexible amphipathic character which promotes their self&#8208;organizations into liquid&#8208;crystal mesophases and their ability to mimic lipids. Combining luminescence to these amphipathic properties opens new prospects, e.&#8201;g., following gene or drug delivery inside cells. These salts, all&#8208;in&#8208;one, should lead to new tools for biologists, as well as active theranostic molecules.

         <dc:description>The rapid Pd0&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling of [11C]CH3I with carboxytriphenylsilane (1)&#160;to synthesize [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid ([11C]2)&#160;and its corresponding imidyl esters as radiolabeling reagents for&#160;11C&#8208;acetylation is reported. The reaction of [11C]CH3I with&#160;1  using a Pd2  (dibenzylideneacetone)3/P(o&#8208;tolyl)3  (1:4) catalyst in tetrahydrofuran/H2O (9:1) at 90&#160;&#176;C for 4&#160;min afforded [11C]2  having satisfactory radioactivity and a good yield. The coupling of the cationic carbon atom of methyl iodide and the carboxyl group in&#160;1  is an ionicity&#8208;driven reversed&#8208;polarity reaction. An injectable radiopharmaceutical formulation of [11C]2  prepared using 33 GBq of [11C]CH3I had a radioactivity of 7.4&#8211;7.8&#160;GBq, and the decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of [11C]CH3I into [11C]2  was 63&#8211;73%. [11C]2  was converted to [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid phthalimidyl ester ([11C]3)&#160;or its succinimidyl ester ([11C]10), which were used for the&#160;11C&#8208;acetylation of 4&#8208;aminophenol, oxytocin, and albumin.

         <title>Dual&#8208;State Emissive &#960;&#8208;Extended Salicylaldehyde Fluorophores: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and First&#8208;Principle Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for simple, low&#8208;cost, versatile, easily accessible, stimuli&#8208;responsive, highly emissive molecular fluorophores emitting both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state has prompted us to investigate the optical properties of a series of synthetically accessible salicylaldehyde derivatives possessing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety at their 4&#8208;position. These dyes are mainly known as synthetic intermediates but can also display sizeable Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) fluorescence owing to the presence of a 6&#8208;membered H&#8208;bonded ring in their structure. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been studied in solution (multiple solvents) and in the solid&#8208;state, as doped in PMMA films, KBr pellets or as powders leading to the observation of a pronounced fluorosolvatochromism. Emission wavelengths in the range 400&#8208;654 nm, along with photoluminescence quantum yields up to 76% were recorded. Modification of the spacer (ethynyl, vinyl or direct connection) involved the &#960;&#8208;delocalization triggers major differences in terms of maximum emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yields in the various media studied. All photophysical observations are rationalized by first&#8208;principle calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diaminoterephthalate&#8208;EDTA and &#8208;EGTA Conjugates &#8211; "Turn on"&#8208;Fluorescence Sensors for Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly effective "turn&#8208;on" fluorescence sensor with high selectivity for Zn2+  ions is reported. Its constitution simply consists of two units of the fluorescence dye diaminoterephthalate (DAT) and the chelate ligand EDTA. In total, four products (DAT)2EDTA and (DAT)2EGTA were prepared by conjugation of DATs with chelate ligands EDTA and EGTA as sensors for metal ions in solution. The fluorescence of all four compounds is strongly quenched by coordination of Cu2+  and Ni2+  ions. For one EDTA&#8208;derivative, the fluorescence quantum yield is increased by the factor of five with ten equivalents of ScCl3. For both EDTA derivatives, the fluorescence quantum yield increased by the factor of five with one equivalent Zn(OAc)2. Therefore, the (DAT)2EDTA structures define fluorescence sensors with a high selectivity for Zn2+  accompanied by a strong "turn&#8208;on" effect with Zn2+  ions. Furthermore, the coordination geometry of (DAT)2EDTA with Zn2+  was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis of the trinuclear complex [ZnCl2]{Zn(OH2)[(DAT)2EDTA &#8211; 2 H]}  2  &#8729;  6.5 H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

         <title>Electrochemical Induced Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Difunctionalization of Alkynes: The Synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Iodovinyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for electrochemical iodosulfonylation of alkynes was developed under oxidant&#8208;free condition. This procedure affords valuable &#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones with broad substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Moreover, this facile protocol can be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfone.







Abstract
An efficient, green, and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for alkyne difunctionalization was described. Using undivided electrochemical cell for iodosulfonylation of alkynes with commercially available iodide radical (NaI), arylsulfonyl radical (ArSO2NHNH2) sources, a variety of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones were obtained in one&#8208;pot with wide substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under mild and ecofriendly conditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphine Mediated Oxidative Phosphorylation of Aromatic Amines and P(OR)3 under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;phosphine system was developed to promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under aerobic conditions. Importantly, this method could be applied not only to the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates (C&#8722;P bonds) but also to produce phosphoramides (N&#8722;P bonds). This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;phosphine system (Cu(OAc)2 and t&#8208;Bu3P&#8901;HBF4) was used to synthesize &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under oxygen atmosphere. With this Cu&#8722;P system, &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates containing C&#8722;P bonds were generated from N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or N&#8208;methylanilines and trialkyl phosphites; phosphoramidates containing N&#8722;P bonds were produced from N&#8208;benzylanilines and trialkyl phosphites. This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds. The compounds containing phosphoryl group attracted extensive attention due to their biological activities and wide applications.[1,2] The &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates have been applied in medicine and agriculture such as anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antibacterial agents, and enzyme inhibitors.[1] And phosphoramides could be served as antibiotics, prodrugs, flame retardants, and ligands.[2]

         <title>Selective Nitration of Open&#8208;Cage [60]Fullerene Derivatives by Ponzio Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponzio reaction converts the oxime group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivatives into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, one of which acts as an effective stopper above the orifice.







Abstract
The carbonyl group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivative was converted into an oxime group when treated with hydroxylamine. Nitrogen tetroxide could convert the oxime group into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, similar to the Ponzio reaction of classical organic compounds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data shows that one of the nitro group is directly above the orifice acting as an effective stopper. Presence of the gem&#8208;dinitro groups also showed significant effect on the reactivity of other functional groups on the rim of the orifice.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization through ozonolysis and cyclization with reductive amination of various readily available cycloalkenes.







Abstract
An improved, efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization of various readily available cyclic compounds containing ring C=C bond. The stereocontrolled synthetic concept was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of various unsaturated scaffolds across ozonolysis followed by ring closing with double reductive amination with primary alkylamines or fluorinated alkylamines. The protocol provided versatile azaheterocyclic derivatives with a piperidine or azepane framework.

         <dc:description>
A class of trinuclear N&#8208;fused hybrid scaffolds was constructed by transition metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling and cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208; or 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aryloxybenzimidazoles under microwave irradiation.







Abstract

This process seems to proceed via an initial C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling by an addition&#8208;elimination nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and subsequent cyclization accompanied by extrusion of alcohols.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Aziridines Via Asymmetric Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first organocatalytic method for the desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;aziridines that does not require the use of an external nucleophilic reagent. The process was designed upon a base promoted rearrangement of bicyclic  meso  &#8208;cyclopentanone aziridines, that progresses in intramolecular fashion to provide densely functionalized cyclic ketones, key intermediates for the preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. The key enantio&#8208;determining step proceeded under the catalysis of a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst. The process provides an entry to a class of highly functionalized chiral amines, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones, not accessible with previous desymmetrization methods. The ambiphilic nature of the products makes them versatile synthetic intermediates in the preparation of natural products and popular antiviral nucleoside inhibitors, for example abacavir.</dc:description>

A robust gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of novel 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane building blocks as fluorinated 2,4&#8208;methanoproline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Intermolecular Photoredox Coupling: Alternative to Norrish Type II Reaction and Yang Cyclization in Ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction pathway of the photoconversion of butyrophenone is reported. In addition to the Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization, intermolecular species are generated: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane, 2&#8208;phenacylacetonitrile and pinacols. They account for approx. 20&#8201;% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The acetophenone enol intermediate has been identified as an H&#8208;atom donor for the proposed mechanistic steps.







Abstract
A new reaction pathway for the photoconversion of butyrophenone in acetonitrile was investigated. In addition to the classic intramolecular photoreactivity of ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds (Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization), intermolecular generated species were isolated and characterized: 1,2&#8208;Dibenzoylethane, 2&#8208;phenacylacetonitrile (oxidized species) and pinacols (reduced species). They account for approx. 20&#8201;% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The acetophenone enol intermediate, formed in&#8197;situ via the Norrish type II reaction, has been identified as an H&#8208;atom donor for the main intermolecular reaction steps, and has been distinguished from other conceivable mechanistic possibilities. Experimental results with analogue compounds suggest that the intermolecular product formation pathway may be of general relevance.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free and Oxidant&#8208;Free Radical Cyclization of (2&#8208;Isocyanoaryl)(methyl)sulfanes with Ethers</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel visible light&#8208;induced oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanoaryl thioethers with ethers has been established, which provides an expeditious approach to access ether&#8208;functionalized benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields. The obtained products combine benzothiazole with ether and represent key structural motifs of a large of biologically active molecules in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A novel cascade cyclization of (2&#8208;isocyanoaryl) (methyl)sulfanes and ethers is developed. With 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and the irradiation of blue LED light, ether radicals are efficiently generated without adding any oxidant, endowing the strategy with features of oxidant&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity. This strategy provides efficient approach to access various ether&#8208;containing benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

An approach for the preparation of polysustituted furans through a metal&#8208;free base&#8208;catalyzed oxacyclization of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols is described. With this approach 32 new compounds were obtained. Furthermore, natural population analysis by DFT calculations, highlighted experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran.







Abstract
An efficient base catalyzed oxacyclization of Z&#8208;enynols has been developed under transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, thus resulting in a variety of new di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. This approach allowed us to obtain 32 new compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were realized to depict a relationship between the natural population analysis and experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran. A one&#8208;pot Sonogashira/oxacyclization approach offers a flexible, robust and efficient alternative to base catalyzed cyclization is also carried out.

         <title>Recent advances in the chemical synthesis of capuramycin nucleoside antibiotic</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capuramycin is an important lead nucleoside antibiotic for the development of new therapeutic agents against the multidrug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Due to the poor accessibilities, the heterogeneous issues and difficulties in the modification of capuramycin at the specific positions, in&#8208;depth studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR) of capuramycin are hampered. Chemical synthesis is a reliable and effective method to provide the capuramycin and analogues. Thus far, only four different synthetic routes toward capuramycin have been reported. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on the chemical synthesis of capuramycin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Catalyzed Cyclization of Bis(enones): A Viable Approach to the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclopentane Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor.







Abstract
Photoredox catalytic cyclization of aryl enones in the presence of visible light, promoted either by metals or organic dyes, represent a valuable strategy for the synthesis of cycloalkanes. The development of a stereoselective version of such transformation, in the presence of the metal&#8208;free catalyst Eosin Y was studied, with the aim to realize an efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings, taking advantage of the flow reactors technology. The use of a chiral auxiliary on the bisenone to be cyclized offers a straightforward and convenient option to exert a stereocontrol on the light&#8208;driven cyclization. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, a functionalized 1,2&#8208;trans cyclopentane ring in up to 83/17 enantiomeric ratio. When the reaction was performed in continuo, in a homemade coil photoreactor, high yields were observed. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor, without any change in the diastereoseletctivity of the process.

         <title>Recent Advances in Direct C&#8208;H Radical Alkylation of 1,4&#8208;Quinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Quinones display unique redox and biological properties and have multiple applications in a wide array of fields, including health. Synthesis of diversely&#8208;substituted quinone&#8208;based compounds remains difficult and usually consists of multiple step sequences. Interest in direct C&#8208;H radical alkylation of 1,4&#8208;quinones has thus continuously grown over this last decade. These reactions involve addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated from radical precursors through decarboxylative alkylation, hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction, or by carbon&#8208;halogen bond reduction. Recent progresses in radical chemistry, including photoredox catalysis, have provided useful tools for quinone functionalization. This review describes the recent progress with these methodologies, including the new promising three&#8208;component cascade reactions involving quinones and alkenes, allowing the preparation of complex substituted 1,4&#8208;quinones in a single step.</dc:description>

Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt3/NEt3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first&#8208;order in catalyst and zero&#8208;order in aldehyde over a broad range of aldehyde concentrations. The observed reaction rate is higher for catalysts bearing N&#8208;aryl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. A concurrent, NHC&#8208;independent substrate isomerization was also observed and found to demonstrate a first&#8208;order dependence on aldehyde concentration. The reported data are consistent with deprotonation to form the Breslow intermediate being turnover&#8208;limiting in this process.

The wide variety of heterocycles that can be prepared using these precursors, together with the high regioselectivity they usually provide in type [3+2] and [3+3] cyclocondensation reactions, makes these powerful starting materials one may have in hand.

         <title>Studies Toward the Total Synthesis of Schinortriterpenoids: Diastereoselective Synthesis of the Left&#8208;Hand Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. The left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, has been synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. In this study, the left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, was synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity. This stereoselectivity was investigated by computational studies. Further selective transformation provided a tricyclic skeleton with the desired stereochemistry.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation on Modified Analogues of an Argininocalixarene Based Non&#8208;viral Gene Vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of eight novel calix[4]arene&#8208;cone amphiphiles bearing different types and numbers of cationic headgroups at the upper rim and different alkyl chains at the lower rim were synthesized and studied in pDNA binding and cell transfection in order to dissect the role of each of these structural elements on gene delivery properties of this promising class of non&#8208;viral vectors.







Abstract
The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene 1 has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different types of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by negligible toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, and v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg, might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into the cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carboborylation for the Synthesis of Borylated Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interception of &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;palladium complexes in catalysis is a powerful strategy for the generation of molecular complexity. We have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes, which proceeds in good yields and moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reaction were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and chiral deep eutectic solvents (CDESs) in asymmetric organocatalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this minireview we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Protosilylation/Protoborylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroallenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective protosilylation and protoborylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford tertiary and secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallyl compounds have been developed. The reactions proceed under very mild reaction conditions and provided the corresponding products in high efficiency.







Abstract
We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford gem&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. It is different from non&#8208;fluorine allenes in which nucleophiles are added to &#947;&#8208;position of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;addition products. Not only monosubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes but also disubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes could react well with silaboronate (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The protocol is simple and efficient to construct compounds which contain tertiary/secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. Moreover, diverse organofluorine compounds can be converted from these organoboronates and silanes.

         <title>Study of Rhodamine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Organic Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives were used as fluorescent probes in the detection and real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates in different solvents. Mechanism studies reveal a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring with the presence or absence of radicals.







Abstract
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives for the detection of radical intermediates in organic reactions were synthesized and used as fluorescent probes over a wide range of solvents. The mechanistic studies confirm a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

Bio&#8208;based methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) has been oxidized to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Densely functionalized methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate is stable at low temperatures but slowly dimerizes by a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Accordingly, methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been developed as a new dienophile in the classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes







Abstract
Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by the addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <title>Strigolactones: Phytohormones with Promising Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6a,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  &lt;p&gt;Multigram synthesis of oxa- and azabicyclo[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;.1.0]alkan-1-yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5-step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An approach to the synthesis of oxa- and azabicyclo[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;.1.0]alkan-1-yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2-bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera-substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing-metathesis, mild palladium-catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).&lt;/p&gt;

  An approach to 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isostere of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained in multigram scale through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
