         <title>Substituted Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters (SMAHOs): Greener Nucleophiles for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted malonic acid half&#8208;oxyesters (SMAHOs) constitute an original family of malonic acid derivatives. They could be used as pro&#8208;nucleophiles through decarboxylative processes, making them enolate equivalents for the elaboration of greener methodologies. In addition to the native ester function, the presence of a substituent on the malonic position affords additional opportunities for structural diversification. These reagents are particularly well&#8208;suited for the development of organocatalyzed processes, which has recently led to olefination and addition reactions as relevant synthetic routes to elaborated structures under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylation of Aldehydes in the Total Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarbonylation of aldehydes is an important reaction used for defunctionalization of molecules. The aldehyde functional group can act as a traceless and transient directing group and its removal can be accomplished with different transition metal catalysts. This Review focuses on the application of the decarbonylation of aldehydes in the total synthesis of natural products with metal&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Decarbonylation is an invaluable reaction, utilized by nature and chemists alike. In different life forms, such as prokaryotes, plants and animals, this transformation is catalyzed by aldehyde decarbonylases. In the laboratory, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) decarbonylation, which was first achieved in 1959, is by and large the dominant way for conducting this reaction. The carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage is most often made possible by RhCl(PPh3)3 i.&#8201;e. Wilkinson's catalyst, but other metals are also used, both in academia and in industry. In this review, we chose to present the applications of TMC decarbonylation in the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. More than 30 examples are showcased and categorized into three categories based on the essence of the role of the aldehyde group in the synthesis. A short outlook is given in the end, listing the different advantages and disadvantages of Wilkinson's catalyst, as well as offering a brief prospect for the future.

         <title>Scope, Limitations and Mechanistic Analysis of the HyperBTM&#8208;Catalyzed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Heterocyclic Alcohols**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isothiourea HyperBTM catalyzes the acylative kinetic resolution of a wide range of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols under mild conditions with high selectivity. The synthetic utility of the methodology has been demonstrated with the preparation of two bioactive targets. Kinetic analysis reveals a fractional reaction order with respect to the alcohol concentration.







Abstract
The full scope and limitations of the catalytic acylative kinetic resolution of a range of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols (78 examples, s up to &gt;200) is reported under operationally&#8208;simple conditions, using low loadings of a commercially available Lewis basic isothiourea catalyst, HyperBTM (generally 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The protocol is highly effective for the kinetic resolution of 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindole and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;hydroxylactam derivatives bearing up to three potential recognition motifs at the stereogenic tertiary carbinol center. The full power of this methodology has been showcased through the synthesis of highly enantioenriched biologically&#8208;active target compounds in both enantiomeric forms. To provide further insight into the reaction mechanism, a detailed kinetic analysis of this Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of tertiary alcohols is reported using the variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) method.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Addition to Levoglucosenone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) transfer is applied to the stereoselective addition of alkanes, acetales, ethers, formamide and aldehydes to levoglucosenone. Bond dissociation energies and partial charges have been calculated in order to discuss the highly selective HAT at cyreneTM.







Abstract
Using photocatalysis with tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT), alkanes, cyclic acetals, cyclic ethers, formamide and aldehydes were added in a stereoselective way to levoglucosenone (LGO). A hydrogen atom is transferred from the donor compound to the photochemically excited TBADT, and the resulting radicals add onto LGO in a stereoselective way. In the case of the addition of adamantane, two regio&#8208;isomers were obtained which form a crystalline solid solution. Cyrene&#8482;, obtained by hydrogenation of LGO, was added under the same conditions. In this case, only two of 32 possible isomers of the resulting Cyrene&#8482; dimer were formed. The regio&#8208;selectivity of the HAT step is discussed in detail. For this purpose, bond dissociation energies and partial charges have been calculated. Transition state calculations of the radical addition to LGO explain the stereospecificity of this reaction step.

&lt;p&gt;Using photocatalysis with tetra-n-butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT), alkanes, cyclic acetals, cyclic ethers, formamide and aldehydes were added in a stereoselective way to levoglucosenone (LGO). A hydrogen atom is transferred from the donor compound to the photochemically excited TBADT, and the resulting radicals add onto LGO in a stereoselective way. In the case of the addition of adamantane, two regio-isomers were obtained which form a crystalline solid solution. Cyrene&#8482;, obtained by hydrogenation of LGO, was added under the same conditions. In this case, only two of 32 possible isomers of the resulting Cyrene&#8482; dimer were formed.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed aminofluoroalkylative cyclization of unactive alkenes with iododifluoromethyl ketones was developed to construct versatile difluoroalkylated Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles including aziridines, pyrrolidines and piperidines in moderate to high yields. This method features a broad substrate scope and has been demonstrated on gram scale.

         <title>Direct Difluoromethylation of Heterocycles through Photosensitized Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, direct C(sp2)&#8208;H difluoromethylation of heterocycles through visible light&#8208;induced electron transfer was developed. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles by only using photoexcited diacetyl. The reaction showed a broad substrate tolerance and gave the products in good yields. Moreover, the representative products exhibited potential drug activity and showed good antifungal activities.







Abstract
Difluoromethylation is of prime importance for its applicability in functionalizing diverse fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles, which are core groups in diverse biologically and pharmacologically active ingredients. Herein, we report a novel transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free visible light&#8208;photoinduced protocol for direct C(sp2)&#8208;H difluoromethylation of heterocycles. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles without using colored organic dyes and metal catalysts in good yields and showed a broad substrate tolerance. Moreover, the representative products exhibited potential drug activity, and one product showed good antifungal activities against Rhizoctorzia solani (62.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Synthesis of Adamantyl H&#8208;Phosphinate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein described several methods for the preparation of 1&#8208;adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters. Either H&#8208;phosphinic acids are esterified with 1&#8208;adamantanol, or adamantyl hypophosphite reacts through phosphorus&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;formation. Adamantyl esters are significantly less reactive than their primary or secondary alkyl counterparts.







Abstract
Adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters have been described by Leclaire, Giordano, and coworkers as &#8220;universal precursors of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds&#8221; after resolution by chiral HPLC, because these esters resist racemization during displacement with organometallics. In that work, the racemic esters were prepared from phosphorus trichloride or dichlorophosphines (RPCl2). We decided to investigate alternative methods for the preparation of these important precursors. Esterification methods included EDC, PivCl, and T3P. A protocol to avoid chromatographic purification was also developed and used for multigram&#8208;scale synthesis. Finally, adamantyl hypophosphite 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was also prepared and used in the synthesis adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters, thereby providing an alternative to the esterification of H&#8208;phosphinic acids, although 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was much less reactive than other hypophosphite esters.

         <title>Investigation of Squaramide Catalysts in the Aldol Reaction En Route to Funapide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric aldol reaction of an industrially viable synthesis of funapide, a promising analgesic agent, was studied with a range of squaramide catalysts. Compared to previously employed thiourea structures, these catalysts provided a non&#8208;negligible improvement in the enantioselectivity of the reaction, while keeping similar activity.







Abstract
Funapide is a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;spirocyclic oxindole with promising analgesic activity. A reported pilot&#8208;plant scale synthesis of this chiral compound involves an asymmetric aldol reaction, catalyzed by a common bifunctional thiourea structure. In this work, we show that the swapping of the thiourea unit of the catalyst for a tailored squaramide group provides an equally active, but rewardingly more selective, catalyst for this aldol reaction (from 70.5 to 85&#8201;% ee). The reaction was studied first on a model oxindole compound. Then, the set of optimal conditions was applied to the target funapide intermediate. The applicability of these conditions seems limited to oxindoles bearing the 3&#8208;substituent of funapide. Exemplifying the characteristics of target&#8208;focused methodological development, this study highlights how a wide&#8208;range screening of catalysts and reaction conditions can provide non&#8208;negligible improvements in an industrially viable asymmetric transformation.

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides through Electrochemically Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. The principle of the oxidation of symmetrical disulfides was expanded to the conversion of in&#8197;situ generated unsymmetrical disulfides yielding the respective thiosulfonates. A strong dependency of the regioselectivity for the formation of the unsymmetrical thiosulfonates was encountered and allows their regioselective formation in the future.







Abstract
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realized. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby using a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were generated in&#8197;situ through metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiosulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalization or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The reaction scope was investigated by converting differently functionalized aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.

         <title>Organocalcium Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Coupling of Hydrosilanes with Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a calcium alkyl complex [LCaCH2SiMe3] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(tBu)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3) as the catalyst, the reactions of n&#8208;HexSiH3 with terminal alkynes are able to provide trialkynylsilanes. On the other hand, the reactions of Et2SiH2 with terminal alkynes give monoalkynylsilanes efficiently.







Abstract
Alkynylsilanes are an important class of organic compounds and dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes provides a convenient and simple route to alkynylsilanes. On the other hand, calcium is an abundant, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly element and using organocalcium complexes as catalytic reagents in organic synthesis recently attracted increasing attentions. Here we report an organocalcium complex&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes. With a calcium alkyl complex [LCaCH2SiMe3] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(tBu)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3) as the catalyst, the reactions of n&#8208;HexSiH3 with terminal alkynes provide trialkynylsilanes and those of Et2SiH2 with terminal alkynes give monoalkynylsilanes efficiently.

Transformation of cyclopropylcarbinols 7 to 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes 9 established a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality&#8208;exchange method in two steps: i) BF3&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening cyclization of D&#8208;A cyclopropylcarbinols 7 (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) to afford aryldihydronaphthalenes 8, which bear ortho&#8208;R substituents on the benzene ring; ii) dehydrogenation of the obtained aryldihydronaphthalenes 8 by using DDQ furnished the axially chiral arylnaphthalenes 9 with 90 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Transformations of enantioenriched donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) cyclopropylcarbinols to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes that bear an ortho&#8208;substituent on a benzene ring provided a successful chirality&#8208;exchange method with a high level of stereoinduction. A central chirality&#8208;transfer step, i.&#8201;e., a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening cyclization of enantioenriched D&#8208;A cyclopropylcarbinols (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), afforded 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes with an ortho&#8208;substituent (Me, Br, OMe, OBn, or OiPr) on the benzene ring with high enantioselectivity (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality&#8208;exchange step, i.&#8201;e., the dehydrogenation of the obtained enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes using DDQ, furnished the axially chiral 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes with high enantioselectivity (90 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Importantly, we developed a highly enantioselective synthesis of a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an ortho&#8208;alkoxy group on the benzene ring. Moreover, we improved the chirality exchange to furnish a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzene ring in high yield with high ee.

         <dc:description>
The acceleration of 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl allylic carbamates under microwave irradiation was described. The implementation of these unconventional thermal conditions allowed the development of an original synthetic route to new heterocycle products such as (E)&#8208;5&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxaninane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones.







Abstract
In a first instance, the effect of the microwave irradiation on the 1,3&#8208;Dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl allylic carbamates was investigated. Under these new conditions, the reaction acceleration was clearly highlighted compared to conventional heating conditions. Depending on the electronic nature of substituents on the aromatic group, this type of rearrangement can be faster with similar or improved yields. Due to this experimental improvement, the diversity of aryl allylic carbamates able to undergo this rearrangement in a reasonable reaction time (30&#8197;min.) and with acceptable to high yields was greatly extended. Finally, an original synthetic way involving this microwave&#8208;assisted process to access new six&#8208;membered heterocyclic structures such as (E)&#8208;5&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was developed from Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts showing the interest of this molecular rearrangement approach. DFT and Fragment Distortion studies showed in general polar transition structures and connected high deformation and interaction energies with lower activation barriers.

         <title>N&#8208;Thiocyanato&#8208;2,10&#8208;camphorsultam Derivatives: Design and Applications of Original Electrophilic Thiocyanating Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral electrophilic thiocyanating reagents was designed and synthesized through an efficient protocol. These bench&#8208;stable and robust reagents were applied for the functionalization of electron&#8208;rich (hetero)arenes and the difunctionalization of alkenes.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable electrophilic thiocyanating reagents was depicted in two steps from readily available starting materials in good yields. These newly designed electrophilic reagents were successfully applied for the thiocyanation of different nucleophiles under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary experiments for the asymmetric C3&#8208;thiocyanation of an oxindole derivative were also conducted leading to the expected product with no induction of chirality, although opening possibilities for accessing chiral compounds.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Dimerization of Xanthenyl Radicals and Dynamic Qualities of a Congested Ethane: Diethyl Dixanthenyl&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;Dicarboxylate</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermolysis of the central weak C&#8722;C bond in a symmetrical xanthenyl dimer produces two carbon&#8208;centered xanthenyl radicals. Dissociation is highly reversible &#8211; the radicals couple exclusively in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion that reforms the original sterically congested ethane, which itself exhibits restricted rotation about the central ethane C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Exploration of the sterically&#8208;congested ethane diethyl dixanthenyl&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate has revealed the dynamic behavior arising from its congested C&#8722;C bond. Interlocking &#8216;geared&#8217; substituents and favorable dispersion interactions around this bond result in a conformational preference for partially cofacial xanthene moieties both in solid state and as dilute solutions. The weak, centrally located C&#8722;C bond is 1.628&#8197;&#197; long and permits selective thermolysis to yield two carbon&#8208;centered ethyl xanthenyl&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate radicals, which dimerize with high fidelity into the original sterically&#8208;congested ethane. Recombination of the radicals into this symmetrical head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimer is highly reproducible &#8211; by observing the equilibrium, the bond dissociation enthalpy was calculated to be 20.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The substituents around the central carbon provide insufficient stabilization against oxygen, which consumes the radicals and unbalances the dimer&#8208;radical equilibrium.

         <title>Front Cover: Photocatalytic Radical Addition to Levoglucosenone (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the stereo and regio selective addition of radical species such as alkyl or formamidyl radicals to levoglucosenone. Levoglucosenone is a biobased platform chemical obtained from celluloses. The radical intermediates are generated by hydrogen atom transfer involving photocatalysis with tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT). Cover picture created with the help of Tony Leclet. More information can be found in the Article by N. Hoffmann et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Properties of Bis(naphthocyclobuta)pyrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 1, January 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New polycyclic conjugated scaffolds combining pyrene and cyclobutadienoid were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds show different aromaticity and photophysical properties as a result of the fusion patterns of pyrene and cyclobutadienoid. Moreover, tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking of bisnaphtho[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:3,4]cyclobuta[1,2&#8208;e:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;l]pyrene leads to a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor.







Abstract
This study explored new polycyclic conjugated scaffolds combining pyrene and cyclobutadienoid rings. Regioisomeric bis(naphthocyclobuta)pyrenes were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. It was found that the regioisomeric polycyclic conjugated scaffolds exhibit different local aromaticity and photophysical properties as a result of the different fusion patterns of pyrene and cyclobutadienoid. Tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking of bisnaphtho[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:3,4]cyclobuta[1,2&#8208;e:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;l]pyrene by changing the length of the alkyl substituents led to a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor for solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors.

         <title>Mechanistically Guided One Pot Synthesis of Phosphine&#8208;Phosphite and Its Implication in Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of hybrid phosphorus ligands is a multistep, time&#8208;consuming exercise. This limitation has been addressed by meticulous understanding of the process of formation of hybrid ligands and a one pot synthesis of a phosphine&#8208;phosphite ligand (L1) is reported for the first time. L1 coordinates to Rh and catalyzes asymmetric hydrogenation of 15 substrates with a high TOF of 2289 and enantiomeric excess of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although hybrid bidentate ligands are known to yield highly enantioselective products in asymmetric hydrogenation (AH), synthesis of these ligands is an arduous process. Herein, a one pot, atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a hybrid phosphine&#8208;phosphite (L1) is reported. After understanding the reactivity difference between an O&#8208;nucleophile versus C&#8208;nucleophile, one pot synthesis of Senphos (L1) was achieved (72&#8201;%). When L1 was treated with [Rh], 31P NMR revealed bidentate coordination to Rh. Senphos, in the presence of rhodium, catalyzes the AH of Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;3&#8208;phenylacrylate and discloses an unprecedented turn over frequency of 2289, along with excellent enantio&#8208;selectivity (92&#8201;%). The generality is demonstrated by hydrogenating an array of alkenes. The AH operates under mild conditions of 1&#8211;2&#8197;bar H2 pressure, at room temperature. The practical relevance of L1 is demonstrated by scaling&#8208;up the reaction to 1&#8197;g and by synthesizing DOPA, a drug widely employed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Computational insights indicate that the R isomer is preferred by 3.8&#8197;kcal/mol over the S isomer.

The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Dendrimer&#8208;Like Oligoguanidines and Their Use in a Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active organic dendrimers are of interest for a variety of applications, e.g. as components in optoelectronic devices and energy&#8208;storage (battery) materials, and were also used to model enzymatic reactivity. Here, we report the first synthesis of redox&#8208;active dendrimer&#8208;like oligoguanidines, assembling six or twelve guanidino groups attached to aromatic cores in one molecule. The novel oligoguanidines, being strong electron donors, are characterized in their stable (neutral and dicationic) redox states. Redox processes occur preferrentially at the core, while the periphery provides highly Br&#248;nsted basic sites. The combined electron and proton acceptor properties of the molecules in their stable oxidized dicationic redox state motivate applications in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. In this work, we test their application in a representative intramolecular oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of pyranocyclopentaindolines representing the western sections of janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Reactions Controlled by Ring&#8208;Chain Tautomerism of 2&#8208;Formylbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is an intensive area of research as it has found utility in the creation of molecular assemblies, complex systems, and ordered frameworks. Herein we demonstrate the development of dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) of common N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;mononucleophiles by controlling ring&#8208;chain tautomerism of 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acid. The regulation of distinct dual reactivity of interconverting open aldehyde and cyclic hemiacetal forms, the thermodynamic stabilization through chelation and delocalization, as well as the kinetic effect resulting from neighboring group participation, enabled the realization of DCRs of a broad range of alcohols, thiols, primary amines, and secondary amines exhibiting high efficiency and fast equilibrium. The dynamic nature of the system was verified through component exchange, and the switch of DCRs was achieved through the manipulation of substrate selectivity. The investigation of mechanism shed insights on the dependence of reaction pathways on nucleophiles, laying the foundation for future design and application.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction has been stablished as an important C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming transformation between carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and activated olefins. However, the slow reaction rate usually observed with electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners hinders a more widespread use of this reaction. In order to overcome this drawback, the effects of several Br&#248;nsted acids on the rate of DABCO&#8208;catalyzed MBH reactions were evaluated. The protocol is operationally simple, involving neat and open&#8208;flask conditions, and is compatible with a wide range of reagents. We suggest a general acid catalysis mechanism to be responsible for the rate increase. The synthetic versatility of the MBH adducts is exemplified with a two&#8208;steps diastereoselective synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;sitophilure. We hope this acid&#8208;mediated protocol to have potential use as a general methodology for the MBH reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study of the Lewis Acid Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions of Nitrones with Nucleophilic Ethylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The BF  3  Lewis acid (LA) catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of 1&#8208;pyrroline&#8208;1oxide (PNO) with 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran (DHF) has been studied within the molecular electron density theory (MEDT) at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/6&#8208;311G(d,p) computational level. Electron localization function (ELF) characterizes PNO and the corresponding PNO:BF  3  complex as zwitterionic species. Conceptual DFT indices allow classifying PNO and DHF as marginal electrophiles and strong nucleophiles, while the PNO:BF  3  complex is a strong electrophile. Consequently, while the non&#8208;catalyzed 32CA reaction is non&#8208;polar, the BF  3  catalyzed one has a high polar character, revealed by the analysis of the global electron density transfer (GEDT) at the transition state structures. The BF  3  catalyzed 32CA reaction, which is classified as of reverse electron density flux (REDF), presents high  exo  stereoselectivity, and total  ortho  regioselectivity. The presence of the BF  3  catalyst decreases the activation enthalpy of the 32CA reaction in dichloromethane by 7.5 kcal mol  &#8208;1  , as a consequence of the increase of the polar character of the reaction, in complete agreement with the experimentally observed acceleration.</dc:description>

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently we reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15 &#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient and convenient method for the water&#8208;involved synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto dithiocarbamates has been developed. In the presence of minimal water, the desired products were obtained in good to excellent yields by using thiuram disulfide reagents and substituted &#945;&#8208;haloacetophenones as starting materials. This protocol features high atom economy, mild conditions, good functional tolerance and good to excellent yields, showing potential value for the preparation of some biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper describes the stepwise aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of 1,1&#162;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with a paramagnetic isocyanate, namely, 3&#8208;isocyanato&#8208;2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl, and then with substituted arylisocyanates. The intermediate product (a paramagnetic betaine), which is the product of an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom of the iminophosphorane moiety on the carbon atom of the carbodiimide functional group, was isolated and structurally characterized. Subsequent interaction of the betaine with arylisocyanates under mild conditions gave spin&#8208;labeled ferrocenophanes with the 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimine coupler. It was found that the mutual arrangement of the substituents in the latter depends on the nature of the substituents in the arylisocyanate. Iodophenyl derivatives of 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimines were cross&#8208;coupled with the gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex, thus yielding diradicals: metallocenophanes functionalized with various types of nitroxide substituents. Molecular and crystal structures of all mono&#8208; and diradicals were solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding and transport properties of a benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;based mono&#8208;(thio)urea library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the chemical versatility of the benzo[ b ]thiophene motif, an extensive library of 24 (thio)urea receptors, with different binding properties and lipophilicities was prepared and included &#945;,&#945;&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;, &#946;,&#947;&#8208;, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;, and &#947;,&#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene positional isomers, as well as &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene&#8208;based molecules decorated with aliphatic chains or aryl moieties with different fluorination degrees. 1 H NMR titrations, X&#8208;ray crystallography studies, and DFT calculations showed that the receptors with higher chloride binding affinities were the &#946;,&#946;&#8208; and &#947;,&#947;&#8208;bis&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene and fluorinated aryl &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene derivatives that synergistically bind chloride with the urea and one or two C &#946;/&#947; &#8208;H ancillary binding groups. Experimental efflux studies showed that, among these small drug&#8208;like molecules, only the highly fluorinated analogues displayed anion transmembrane transport activity, suggesting that this property is dependent on the receptors' lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding ability. Moreover, LUV based assays, undertaken under electroneutral and electrogenic conditions, together with NMDG&#8208;Cl assays, indicated that anion efflux occurs mainly through an uniport mechanism. Further MD simulations showed that anion transport is highly dependent on the orientation and interactions of the receptors at the water/lipid interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via side&#8208;chain anchoring of the ornithine &#948;&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides represent a popular class of macrocyclic drug candidates and therefore their solid phase synthesis has attracted much attention. In this contribution we present an efficient method of side&#8208;chain anchoring for ornithine and lysine residues to be used in the standard Fmoc&#8208;based synthesis of cyclic peptides via on&#8208;resin cyclization. We demonstrate that the side chain of ornithine and lysine protected with  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;group can efficiently be converted to the isocyanate which is then immobilized on Wang&#8208;type resin in almost quantitative yield. We further show the synthesis of four biologically active cyclic peptides employing the side chain ornithine anchoring. Our method is at least on a par with the previously reported methodologies in terms of yield and the purity of the final products and is arguably operationally more straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>SNAr Isocyanide Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast method for the easy access of 4&#8208;amino substituted 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;phenyl isocyanides was developed under room temperature with moderate to high yields. The products are very reactive in a number of tested typical multicomponent reactions.







Abstract
Isocyanides are important building blocks in organic synthesis; however, their synthesis is time and resource consuming and often unpleasant due to their smelly nature. Diversification of isocyanides can be accomplished by de novo synthesis or from already existing isocyanides. In this work, we report for the first&#8208;time isocyanide diversification based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution of suitable precursor isocyanides. The mild conditions allow for easy access to multiple novel isocyanides useful in organic synthesis. The resulting isocyanides are solid and non&#8208;noxious, yet react nicely in multicomponent reactions.

         <title>2&#8208; and 6&#8208;Purinylmagnesium Halides in Dichloromethane: Scope and New Insights into the Solvent Influence on the C&#8722;Mg Bond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly functionalized purine systems were obtained using aldehydes and, for the first time, ketones through a recently developed iodo&#8208;Mg exchange methodology that works in DCM. DFT calculations suggested that the observed major stability of the C&#8722;Mg bond generated in DCM at higher temperature compared to the one in THF might be derived from a less polar character of the C&#8722;Mg bond in such non&#8208;coordinating solvent.







Abstract
The generation of positionally stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl magnesium halides is complicated by the often very rapid isomerization to give the 8&#8208;yl Grignards. By conducting the reaction in dichloromethane (DCM), we demonstrated that the anion isomerization can be stopped and these stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl Grignards react directly with a broad scope of aldehydes in good yields. Furthermore, purine functionalization with ketones has been achieved for the first time in the presence of LaCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Density functional theory calculations offer a possible explanation of the special role played by solvent in this chemistry and show that in DCM the C&#8722;Mg bond has a less polar character, whereas in THF it is predominantly ionic and much more basic in nature.

         <title>Organocatalytic asymmetric double addition of kojic acids to 2&#8208;nitroallylic carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Nitroallylic carbonates were first applied as promising bis&#8208;electrophilic C  3  synthons for bifunctional squaramide catalyzed asymmetric domino reaction with kojic acid derivatives to afford so far inaccessible nitro compounds bearing two hydroxypyranone units. The reaction products undergo non&#8208;catalytic epimerization at the carbon atom next to the nitro group. Plausible mechanism of the epimerization based on reversible formation of intermediate  aci  &#8208;nitro compound is proposed. The double addition products were transformed to configurationally stable acetates and to chiral nitro glutarates, promising precursors to chiral amino glutaric acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Entrectinib with Key Photo&#8208;Redox Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling in Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly marketed drug entrectinib was synthesized in 6 steps using photo&#8208;redox in flow as the key C&#8722;N bond forming step. Through investigating various substrates for the C&#8722;N coupling in flow it was discovered that more electron&#8208;poor aryl halides perform optimally in the coupling step. Through varying residence time, temperature, and catalyst loadings tools to reduce hydro&#8208;dehalogenation were discovered.







Abstract
By using photo&#8208;redox catalysis in flow the newly marketed drug entrectinib (referred to by the brand name Rozlytrek) was synthesized in 6 linear steps from readily available building blocks under mild conditions. Evaluation of multiple intermediates for their use in the critical C&#8722;N amination step in flow led to the finding that more electron deficient aryl&#8208;halides achieve higher conversion to the desired product. Data supports that more electron rich aryl&#8208;halides undergo a significant amount of hydro&#8208;dehalogenation compared to the productive C&#8722;N bond formation. Through evaluating various entry points into the synthesis of entrectinib, shorter routes were identified albeit in low yields. The modularity of this route will allow chemists to rapidly synthesize a diverse library of compounds through this route. Via different synthetic intermediates, a scale&#8208;up route was discovered for the synthesis of entrectinib using photo&#8208;redox in flow in less steps than previously reported, highlighting the utility of flow chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Template Synthesis of Novel Norcorrole Complexes with a Phenyl&#8208;substituted Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel norcorrole complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized as the new examples of norcorrole main&#8208;group element complexes. These phosphorus complexes were found to have aromaticity resulting from the peripheral 18&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complex exhibited unique optical properties such as a stronger Q&#8208;band than Soret&#8208;band and a fluorescent emission with significantly small Stokes shift.







Abstract
Novel norcorroles complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized by a template method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction. It was proved that these new norcorrole phosphorus complexes have aromaticity similar to the very recently reported norcorrole complex with a methoxy&#8208;substituted phosphorus center. This aromaticity results from the peripheral 18&#960;&#8208;system consisting of two methine carbons and four amine&#8208;type pyrrole units with formally pentavalent phosphorus center. On the other hand, these phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complexes showed quite characteristic and strong Q&#8208;band derived from less symmetricity of the molecules than other porphyrinoids.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Cascade Annulation Approach for Modular Assembly of Alkynyl/Benzoyl Functionalized Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and efficient synthetic method for alkynyl quinolines  via  TfOH&#8208;promoted cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/intramolecular annulation/aromatization process is established. By virtue of reactive  aza&#8208;o  &#8208;AQM (in situ generated from modular propargylamine), this reaction proceeds smoothly to afford a variety of alkynyl quinolines in good to excellent yields. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process features halo groups tolerance, such as the &#8211;Cl, &#8211;Br, and &#8211;I groups; thus, this protocol circumvents the inherent shortcomings of the existing Sonogashira coupling of halogenated quinolines.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and metal&#8208;free method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly substituted tetrahydro&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;carbolines from Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) bromides of nitroalkenes and iminoindolines has been demonstrated. Cascade reaction of MBH bromides with tosyliminoindolines occurs with regio&#8208; as well as diastereoselectivity in a formal [3+3] manner to form various tetrahydro&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;carbolines with wide substrate scope under mild conditions. All the products were obtained in high yields within a short reaction time. Also, the synthetic efficiency of the methodology was demonstrated by a gram scale experiment and by further converting them into 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;  &#945;&#8208;  carbolines.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Total Synthesis of Racemic Chebulic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid is reported, which is the aglycon of several antioxidant ingredients of the fruit of the  Terminalia chebula  tree. The route started with the straightforward preparation of an indanone&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;oxoester from a benzaldehyde derivative (84% over the first five steps). The side chain of the target compound was then introduced by conjugated addition of a cuprate reagent derived from dimethyl succinate, which was followed by the first key step of the synthesis: a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester. The second key step was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester to a &#948;&#8208;lactone. This is a new reaction which has been recently developed in our laboratories. Finally, chebulic acid was obtained after six&#8208;fold demethylation of three methyl ester moieties and three phenolic ether functions. The overall synthetic route consists of nine consecutive steps and was accomplished in 15% overall yield. Both, the synthetic, racemic product as well the natural, optically active material consist of the same two diastereoisomers (2:1  dr  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Povarov reactions: An update of a powerful catalytic synthetic methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective Povarov reaction is&#160;one of the most powerful synthetic strategy to synthesize chiral, highly functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. The present review aims to collect the most significant successful examples of highly efficient enantioselective catalytic protocols for this reaction, since 2014 to the present day. Herein, we provide a comprehensive discussion of different catalytic strategies employed in recent years to realize the enantioselective Povarov reaction; the use of chiral phosphoric acids, thio(urea) and proline derivatives, as well as transition metal complexes will be presented. Additionally, this review critically discusses the intriguing and yet obscure mechanistic pathways of this famous reaction, the controversial dispute between a concerted or a polar two&#8208;step process.</dc:description>

         <title>A mechanistic study on the non&#8208;enzymatic hydrolysis of Kdn glycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are biologically important carbohydrates that are prevalent throughout nature. We are interested in their intrinsic reactivity in aqueous solution and how such reactivity affects the design of substrates for investigation of enzymes that process these sugars. To probe the reactivity differences between two sialic acid family members  N  &#8208;acetylneuraminic acid and Kdn we measured the rate constants for hydrolysis of 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;  glycero  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;  galacto  &#8208;non&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonide in aqueous solution. The kinetic data is consistent with glycosidic C&#8211;O bond cleavage occurring via four mechanistic pathways, and these are: (i) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the neutral sugar; (ii) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic carboxylate; (iii) water&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the anionic glycoside; and (iv) base&#8208;promoted reaction of the anionic glycoside. All hydrolytic rate constants for PNP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Kdn were larger than those reported for the parent sialoside 4&#8208;nitrophenyl  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;neuraminide (  2  ). To study the effects of C&#8208;5 substitution on the Kdn glycoside we made g 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 5&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Kdn glycoside (  4  ) and determined its rate constants for hydrolysis. To probe the transition state for the water&#8208;catalyzed reaction (pathway iii) we measured hydrolysis for three aryl &#945;&#8208;Kdn glycosides; the resulting Br&#248;nsted plot exhibited a &#946;  lg  value of &#8211;1.27 &#177; 0.09.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Conjugated syn,syn&#8208;Dithienothiazine Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Dumbbells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of conjugated  syn,syn  &#8208;dithienothiazine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dumbbells is readily synthesized by Suzuki coupling or a one&#8208;pot &#945;&#8208;lithiation&#8208;zincation&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence in moderate to good yield. The title compounds are all electron&#8208;rich reversible oxidizable redox systems with a relatively narrow range of oxidation potentials according to cyclic voltammetry. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy however show a significant effect of the electronic nature of the conjugated bridging system on absorption and emission characteristics. Furthermore, a highly polar excited state can be corroborated by Lippert&#8208;Mataga analysis of the emission solvatochromicity as well as by TD&#8208;DFT calculation of absorption and emission maxima, which classify these dumbbell systems as redox active, luminescent low band gap chromophores with experimentally determined optical band gaps between 2.20 and 2.50 eV.</dc:description>

         <title>PAHs Containing both Heptagon and Pentagon: Corannulene Extension by [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic method based on hydroboration, electrophilic borylation, dehydrogenation and [5+2] annulation affords molecules with both bowl&#8208; and saddle&#8208;shape and the inclusion of a formal azulene unit. Their optical and electronic properties were studied to elucidate the ramifications of different substituents. Furthermore, their aromaticity was assessed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Utilizing Pd&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation a series of heptagon&#8208;extended corannulenes could be synthesized from a borinic acid precursor furnished by C&#8722;H borylation strategy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of two conformational enantiomers crystallizing in a racemic mixture. Through their embedded five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit both negative and positive curvature and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry experiments provided insights into the influence of larger flanking aromatic systems and electron&#8208;donating substituents encompassing the heptagonal ring. Through [5+2] annulation of acenaphthylene an azulene&#8208;containing PAH with intriguing optoelectronical properties including a very small bandgap and absorption over the whole visible spectrum could be obtained. Theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the long&#8208;wavelength absorption and aromaticity.

         <title>Tuning material properties of porous organic cage CC3 with post&#8208;synthetic dynamic covalent chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic cages (POCs) represent a new class of microporous materials with an impressive breadth of potential applications. One of their many advantages is the degree of tunability of cage properties, similar to that seen in more established microporous materials like metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Here, we use a prototypical POC, CC3, to explore the potential to tune cage properties via post&#8208;synthetic dynamic covalent chemistry. Ethylenediamine, the linker used in another POC CC1, was partially substituted into the CC3 cage structure to varying degrees based on the starting relative molar ratios. The resulting products were investigated for the relative distribution of the two linkers, crystallinity, and surface area. We found that even when small amounts of other compatible diamine linkers are introduced, they substitute into the existing cages, although some structural products are apparently favored over others within the reactant ratios investigated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free arylation of thiols with diaryliodonium salts has been developed. The application of a strong organic base enables the C&#8211;S bond formation under mild and experimentally simple conditions. The method allows for the synthesis of aryl sulfides containing a broad range of aryl groups from an array of thiols, including aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl ones. The mechanism of the reaction was studied by DFT calculations, demonstrating that it proceeds via the inner sphere pathway involving formation of an Ar  2  I(SR) intermediate, followed by the reductive elimination.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycosylation reaction involving the coupling of a glycosyl donor with a glycosyl acceptor is one of the cornerstones of chemical preparation of pure glycans and glycoconjugates of biological relevance. Catalytic glycosylation of glycosyl ester donors and thioglycosides is an attractive but underexplored topic in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, Triflic imide (Tf 2 NH)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of various O &#8208;, S &#8208;, and C &#8208;nucleophiles has been achieved using disarmed glycosyl ortho &#8208;isopropenylphenylacetates (GIPPAs) and ortho &#8208;isopropenylbenzyl thioglycosides &#160;as glycosylating agents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions to give the desired glycosides in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Of particular note, the comparable reactivity for the a&#8208;isomers and the &#946;&#8208;ones of GIPPAs is observed. The mechanistic investigation demostrates that the isopropenyl group is essential for the reaction and its preferential protonation triggers the reaction. This work provides another member to the arsenals of glycosyl ester and thioglyoside donors suitable for acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to create various glycosidic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>From Simple Alkenes and CO2 to Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids: Computational Studies and Predictions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated carboxylic acids can be envisaged as future synthetic targets because of their potential applications in materials science and medicinal chemistry. Computational studies suggest that these interesting compounds may be easily accessed from simple alkenes containing &#8722;CF3 or &#8722;SCF3 groups and carbon dioxide by means of a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation sequence.







Abstract
Fluorinated carboxylic acids may soon become a relevant class of compounds for new materials development and as synthons in medicinal chemistry. In this report, a potential method based on a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation reaction sequence has been computationally explored to check whether these moieties could be synthetically accessible. DFT calculations fully support the possibility of obtaining fluorinated carboxylic acids from simple fluorinated alkenes and gaseous carbon dioxide, paving the way to future preparation of this class of chemicals.

Computational studies suggest that these interesting compounds may be easily accessed from simple alkenes containing &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or &#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups and carbon dioxide by means of a hydroboration/copper-catalyzed carboxylation sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated carboxylic acids may soon become a relevant class of compounds for new materials development and as synthons in medicinal chemistry. In this report, a potential method based on a hydroboration/copper-catalyzed carboxylation reaction sequence has been computationally explored to check whether these moieties could be synthetically accessible. DFT calculations fully support the possibility of obtaining fluorinated carboxylic acids from simple fluorinated alkenes and gaseous carbon dioxide, paving the way to future preparation of this class of chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>An efficient catalytic preparation of synthetically useful new &#946;&#8208;borylated enamides was achieved under relatively mild conditions  via  a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp  2  )&#8210;H borylation.

         <title>Synthesis of a Substituted [10]Cycloparaphenylene via [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and investigation of a substituted [10]Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) incorporating a diethylphthalane unit. An efficient strategy relying on a symmetric built&#8208;up starting with propargyl ether as [2+2+2] cycloaddition precursor was developed. The straightforward synthesis required overcoming unexpected obstacles within the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, protection and aromatization. These results give valuable insights for accessing CPPs with highly substituted subunits. Finally, a seven&#8208;step synthesis with an overall yield of 14% provided the target nanoring, including good to excellent yields for the critical macrocyclization and aromatization. The synthesized nanohoop exhibits a hypsochromic shift in fluorescence and absorption, compared to the unsubstituted [10]CPP. This observation is proposedly caused by an increased torsion angle between the bivalent substituted phenyl moieties and the adjacent units.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated amides synthesis starting from carbohydrates based on the Claisen rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for new methods for installation of fluorine atoms into organic molecules is still a widely studied issue. In this paper an efficient synthetic protocol towards the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing amides derived from sugar has been presented. This approach involved the Claisen rearrangement of previously obtained fluorinated vinyl ethers. The three fluorinated olefins: 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (2H&#8208;PFP), 1,2,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (1H&#8208;PFP) and hexafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (HFP) were used as a source of fluorine. New compounds were characterized by  1  H,  19  F and  13  C NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry. The X&#8208;Ray crystal structures of some fluorinated derivatives were obtained confirming the structure, geometry and the absolute configuration. The resulting molecules, due to possibility of further transformation of their functional groups, can be valuable fluorinated scaffolds for the synthesis of subsequent chemical compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent and practical synthesis of fluorescent triphenylamine derivatives and their localization in living cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for new fluorescent triphenylamine (TP) derivatives, we studied the influence of the position and substitution of diverse heterocyclic substituents. A library of 10 fluorescent triphenylamines bearing either oxazoles or thiazoles and pyridiniums, substituted at different positions has been developed. The approach is based on a convergent C&#8208;H activation reaction between pyridine&#8208;oxazoles or pyridine&#8208;thiazoles and di&#8208;iodo triphenylamine. We showed that the nature and substitution pattern of the 5&#8208;membered&#8208; (oxazole, thiazole) or 6&#8208;membered heterocycle (pyridine) has a strong influence on their fluorescence properties and on their localization in living cells as they stain either the nucleus or mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transformation of Lignin and Lignin Model Compounds into Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve selective depolymerization and valorization of lignin due to their complex structure and relatively stable bonds. We herein report an efficient depolymerization strategy that employs 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as oxidant/catalyst to selectively convert different oxidized lignin models to a wide variety of 2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazole&#8208;based compounds in up to 94% yields, by reacting with o&#8208;phenylenediamines with varied substituents. This method could take full advantage of both C  &#946;  and/or C  &#947;  atom in lignin structure to furnish the desirable products instead of forming byproducts, thus exhibiting high atom economy. Furthermore, this strategy can effectively transform both the oxidized hardwood (birch) and softwood (pine) lignin into the corresponding degradation products in up to 45 wt% and 30 wt%, respectively. Through a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; process, we have successfully realized the oxidation/depolymerization/valorization of natural birch lignin at the same time and produced the benzimidazole derivatives in up to 67 wt% total yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Dyn[n]arenes: Versatile Platforms to Study the Interplay between Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dyn[n]arenes are the strict polydisulfide&#8208;based analogues of pillar[n]arenes. Although less famous than their static homologues, these dynamic cavitand possess unique (stereo)chemical features. The disulfide bridge between monomeric units not only provides these architectures with constitutional lability but also an additional stereogenic element. As a result, the covalent assembling process can be guided by supramolecular interactions with or without a targeted partner, enabling to decipher supramolecular at work from the synthetic stage. Not only can the size and functions can be chosen on demand, but the stereochemical features can be precisely controlled by careful choice on the assembling conditions. Eventually, deciphering the interactions at work during self&#8208;assembly opens the way toward innovative applications such as biomolecules sensing. The account describes the synergistic interplay between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds found in dyn[n]arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemistry at Scale: Wireless Light Emitters Drive Sustainability in Process Research &amp; Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study demonstrates a seamless scale&#8208;up of photochemical C&#8722;C&#8208;cross&#8208;couplings of aryls and alkyls via dual Ir/Ni photoredox catalysis. The herein described novel type of internal illumination using wirelessly powered LEDs inside the reaction media allows for efficient scaling and intensification of those reactions, maintaining virtually identical reaction profiles over all scales. The system is readily applicable to other light&#8208;driven reactions as well.







Abstract
Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation by dual Iridium&#8208;Nickel photoredox catalysis has gained a lot of attention for late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;couplings of alkyls with aryls. However, the scalability of such reactions is greatly impeded by the poor light penetration depth into the strongly absorbing reaction media. Wireless internal illumination is a novel technique which circumvents the light penetration issue efficiently and therefore allows to scale photon&#8208;driven reactions by conventional methods. Here we demonstrate that industrially relevant photoredox C&#8722;C couplings can be scaled seamlessly to different volumes, achieving qualitatively and quantitatively the same results at all scales. The use of conventional reactor types allows stirred, bubble column or fixed&#8208;bed operation mode and is fully compatible with heterogeneous reaction mixtures. By minimizing reflection losses, we could also show a significant advantage in the reaction rate over an externally illuminated setup at the same light intensity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes: Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Heterocycles with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;neutral Pd&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized perfluoroalkyl halide is presented. This transformation enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of perfluoroalkyl radicals from the single electron reduction of palladium(0) to perfluoroalkyl halides.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;neutral palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized difluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl halide is presented here. This transformation proceeds smoothly at low temperatures and enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivatives with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested an operative radical mechanism and the initiation of the inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer between a dual phosphine ligand&#8208;coordinated palladium(0) species and perfluoroalkyl halides.

         <title>Trapping Experiments during Reductive Debrominations of Aminotribromosilanes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive debrominations of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 (3) and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 (4) with Mg* in the presence of ethylene revealed the occurrence of transient amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (1) and (2) via the corresponding cycloaddition products. This was confirmed by using 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene in the reductive debromination of (4) that yields the disilabicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (7). Using 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene as trapping agent in the reaction of (4) with Mg* showed that a cyclotrisilene was generated during the reduction.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ generated amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (SiMe3)2N&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 1 and (SiMe3)DippN&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)Dipp 2 were observed examined upon the reductive dehalogenation of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 3 and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 4 with Rieke magnesium (Mg*). Both disilynes were trapped with ethylene to yield the double [2+1] and [2+2] cycloaddition products 5 and 6, respectively. The transient disilynes 1 and 2 were investigated with DFT calculations that revealed 1 to feature more triple bond character than 2. The in&#8208;situ generated disilyne 2 was further quenched with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene to yield the double [2+2] cycloaddition product 7. In the presence of cyclooctatetraene, the reductive debromination of 4 with Mg* generates the bromo&#8208;substituted silacyclopentene 8. This species was also isolated with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene used as trapping reagent as the major product 9, besides the side product 10, that comprises two cyclotrisilene rings linked via a butene unit. The formation of 10 shows that a cyclotrisilene can occur as a side product during the reductive debromination of 4 in the presence of the alkene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N1 Coupling of 3&#8208;Aminoindazoles and Related Aminoazoles with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupling between 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and aryl bromides, selectively occurring at the N1 position, was developed using copper catalysis. The transformation allows the use of a variety of heterocycles for both coupling partners and provides rapid access to arylated aminoazoles of high interest in drug discovery.







Abstract
The N1&#8208;selective arylation of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles using copper catalysis is herein reported. The reaction uses readily accessible aryl bromides as coupling partners, including those from heterocycles, and allows easy access to a broad variety of substituted 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The methodology was also examined on other aminoazoles of interest for the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract
A novel approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones was developed. A series of title compounds were obtained with good functional group tolerance and good yields by I2/DMSO&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;(benzylamino)benzamides to form C=N double bonds. This method was applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A proposed reaction pathway based on some control experiments was also provided.

         <title>Primary Amine Catalyzed Activation of Carbonyl Compounds: A Study on Reaction Pathways and Reactive Intermediates by Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offline ESI&#8208;MS experiments can be easily pursuit to select optimal (catalyst, cocatalyst, reaction time, reagent amounts) working conditions for the primary amines catalyzed activation of carbonyl compounds. Combining MS and MSn experiments with enantioselective HPLC analysis, the catalytic cycle together with its active (typically enamine or iminium ions) intermediates and the stereochemical induction processes were elucidated.







Abstract
The field of organocatalysis is expanding at a fast pace. Its growth is sustained by major stimuli, such as the effort toward an understanding of the mechanisms of reaction and catalytic processes in general, the elucidation of basic properties leading to stereocontrol and the search for broad applicability and scalability of the synthetic methodology. This paper reports a thorough study based on ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry of amino&#8208;organocatalyzed model reactions under different experimental conditions. Off&#8208;line reaction monitoring of mixtures containing different catalytic systems, by ESI&#8208;MSn showed the presence of several putative intermediate species, either in their protonated or sodiated forms. In addition, enantioselective chromatography of crude reactions provides the stereochemical outcome of asymmetric reactions. The bulk of the data collected offers a clue of the intricate pathways occurring in solution for the studied reactions.

         <title>On the Shape and Synthesis of Extended Fluorenones: Recent Advances and Upcoming Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and octa&#8208;cyclic extended fluorenones and their topological diversity. This Review provides an overview of the literature up to March 2021.







Abstract
Extended fluorenones represent a particular class of polycyclic compounds. The extension of the aromatic system through the fusion of additional benzene rings onto the central tricyclic fluorenone gives rise to an impressive topological diversity and allows to modulate the properties of the original molecule. The multiple ways this aromatic extension can be joined onto the tricyclic core generates multiple spatial arrangements from linear, angular, mixed linear&#8208;angular, to helical. This extensive range of shapes and their subsequent applications has piqued the curiosity of the scientific community, who now creatively compete to develop selective and direct routes to these valuable molecular architectures. Potential applications of these diverse domains have also driven the development of strategies for the installation of various substituents at selected sites of the carbon backbone. This Review intends to provide the reader with an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of the methods for constructing extended fluorenones and their properties.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Organocatalytic Kinetic Resolution of Oxazinones through Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study of a new effective approach to obtain orthogonally protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids via the kinetic resolution of oxazinones has been performed. From the computational study, the orientations of the reactants and the mechanism have been elucidated. Finally, the reaction involving a 7&#8208;memebered ring to access enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated.







Abstract
A complete computational study has been performed in order to rationalise the results of a new organocatalytic approach to the kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;substituted oxazinones which results in highly enantioenriched and orthogonally&#8208;protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids. DFT&#8208;analysis elucidated the preferable binding orientation of the 4&#8208;oxazinone under study, predicted the formation of the observed major R product with a calculated ee in good agreement with the experimental data and allowed a complete mechanistic and stereochemical understanding of the catalysis. The alcoholytic kinetic resolution of a 7&#8208;memebered ring analogue to generate enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated for the first time.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Doped PAH Electrochromes: Difurano, Dipyrano, and Furano&#8208;Pyrano Containing Naphthalene&#8208;Cored Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of naphthalenyl&#8208;cored O&#8208;doped small molecule electrochromes was achieved. In a single intramolecular Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano products could be obtained. All molecules showed p&#8208;type semiconducting and electrochromic properties, with the colour of the transition being dependent on the O&#8208;ring.







Abstract
In this work, we report the synthesis of O&#8208;doped naphthalene&#8208;based electrochromes. Exploiting the CuO&#8208;mediated Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, a series of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;cored dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been prepared. Steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission investigations showed that the spectroscopic profile strongly depends on the O&#8208;doping topology, with the dipyrano and the difurano derivatives demonstrating the most red&#8208;shifted and blue&#8208;shifted electronic transition, respectively. Computational investigations revealed that the cycloetherification reaction raises the HOMO energy level (while the LUMO remains largely unaffected), with the dipyrano derivatives displaying the highest values. Spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that, depending on the O&#8208;topology and the type of O&#8208;ring, different electrochromic responses could be obtained with colour transitions featuring high contrasts involving yellow, pink, orange or blue colours.

         <title>A Hexagonal Shape&#8208;Persistent Nanobelt of Elongated Rhombic Symmetry with Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;Planes by a One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triptycenes with their predefined D 3h &#8208;symmetry are excellent molecular building blocks to construct shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles having &#960;&#8208;orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane. However, up to now, there are only a very few examples of fused and rigid iptycene macrocycles synthesized in several consecutive steps in overall yields below 1%. Here we present the simple one&#8208;step one&#8208;pot approach to an iptycene nanobelt, which forms in &gt;2% and can readily isolated from the polymeric by&#8208;product by gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of azido&#8208;dienediols by enzymatic dioxygenation of benzylazides: an experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic azides are a versatile structural motif in organic synthesis because the proximal double bond enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, named as the Winstein rearrangement. In this manuscript an experimental and theoretical study on the double Winstein rearrangement occurring in azidodienediols derived from the biocatalytic dihydroxylation of substituted benzylazides is presented. Substrates bearing a methyl group in  ortho  or  meta  position produced exclusively rearranged exo&#8208;diendiols with the azide group  anti  to the diol moiety as the major constituent. In the case of  para  methyl substrates, an equilibrium mixture of rearranged and non&#8208;rearranged products was observed, indicating that a full conversion to the exo&#8208;dienediols is not possible within this substitution pattern. On the other hand, the presence of a chloro substituent in the diene moiety completely precluded the Winstein rearrangement to take place, giving rise exclusively to the traditional  cis  &#8208;cyclohexadienediols. The observed results were analyzed to determine the mechanistic and kinetic aspects and scope limitations of the reaction as a synthetic tool.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their or&#173;igins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S&#8208;con&#173;figura&#173;tions of their stereocenter had been deduced from expres&#173;sion ex&#173;periments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts. Our syntheses used the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18 as a con&#173;junctive re&#173;a&#173;gent. It was combined with the l&#8208;serine derivatives (S)&#8208;19 or (S)&#8208;21 (&#8220;Western building blocks&#8221;), respectively, through aminolyses.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants, Which Circumvent a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis in the Sequel</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;sty&#173;rene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosub&#173;stituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused octa&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7a&#8208;b and 9a&#8208;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing meta&#173;theses pro&#173;vided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8a&#8208;b and 10a&#8208;c. Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a&#8208;disubstituted (in 8a&#8208;b) or a&#8208;monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a&#8208;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone &#8208; or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone &#8208; 6a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7&#8208;benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Wittig reaction of 3-hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho-sty&#173;rene-2-carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosub&#173;stituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3-carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C-allylated. This furnished the benzene-fused octa-1,8-dienones 7a-b and 9a-c, respectively. Ring-closing meta&#173;theses pro&#173;vided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8a-b and 10a-c. Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a-disubstituted (in 8a-b) or a-monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a-c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone - or 6,7-benzotropolone - 6a: The MeO- and PhS-con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7-benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3. The same in&#173;termediate resulted from the dichloroben&#173;zocy&#173;cloheptadien&#173;one 8b and NaOMe.

         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent-less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc-(Ala-Phe-Gly)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
