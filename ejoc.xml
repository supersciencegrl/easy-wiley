         <title>A Solid Alkylation: Highly Recyclable, Flow Chemistry&#8208;Ready, Resin&#8208;Supported Thioimidazoliums Alkylate Sulfur&#8208;Centered Nucleophile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of readily regenerable thioimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids possessing the ability to transfer an alkyl group to a nucleophile are immobilized on crosslinked polystyrene beads. Different alkyl groups can be loaded onto the resin, highlighting the tunability of the material. The efficiency of these materials is demonstrated by their screening against a series of nucleophiles, showing a particular preference for thiols. Finally, these materials were evaluated for use under continuous flow conditions. The flexibility, ease of use, safety, and recyclability of these alkylating resins shows promise for their use in large scale and automated applications.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;1&#8208;yl derivatives are proposed as promising building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Scalable, efficient, and diastereoselective approach to their preparation via the difluorocyclopropanation of (2&#8208;methylene&#173;cyclopropyl)methanol is developed. Stability of the title scaffolds towards common reaction conditions is confirmed by a series of typical functional group transformations. Physicochemical characte&#173;ristics (pKa, LogP, and aqueous solubility) and structural features of the key 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;yl derivatives are established and compared with those of non&#8208;fluorinated analog, 2,2&#8208;difluorinated isomer, as well as monocyclic&#160;gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804; 2), i.e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time in the literature. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1 H NMR and UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Complementary Cooperative Catalytic Systems in the Aerobic Oxidation of a Wide Range of Si&#8211;H&#8208;Reagents to Si&#8211;OH&#8208;Products: From Monomers to Oligomers and Polymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the applicability of cooperative [M]&#8208;/Organo&#8208;catalytic systems in aerobic Si&#8211;H&#8208;functionalization. A thorough kinetic study allowed us to identify two &#8220;complementary&#8221; catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant [M]&#8208;catalysts and inexpensive commercially available organic catalysts. The first system, Co(OAc)  2  /N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide, made it possible to oxidize a Si&#8211;H&#8208;group to a Si&#8211;OH&#8208;group in a wide range of monomers, including previously unknown ones, that dramatically differ in their reactivity. However, this system failed in the case of oligomeric and polymeric substrates. This problem was solved by application of the Cu(OAc)  2  /N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide system. A wide potential for gram&#8208;scale (50&#8208;100 g) preparation of Si&#8211;OH&#8208;containing products with molecular architectures of different complexity was revealed using the established &#8220;substrate&#8208;reactivity&#8208;catalytic system&#8221; relationship. In particular, previously unknown types of dumbbell&#8208;shaped and graft polymers were synthesized using alkoxysilanols.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent developments in the synthesis of polyhydroxylated indolizidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since their discovery, polyhydroxylated indolizidines have been the focus of attention for both biologists and synthetic chemists. They are classified as iminosugar alkaloids: nitrogen&#8208;based carbohydrate mimetics that are potent inhibitors of glycosidases. Many discovered glycosidase inhibitors were found to possess biological activity, and they are therefore considered to be potential therapeutics in the treatment of various diseases such as viral infections, diabetes, or cancer. Not surprisingly, the interest in the preparation of these substances has been enormous. This review presents the latest developments in the synthesis of naturally occurring polyhydroxylated indolizidines and their synthetic enantiomers. In addition, the synthesis of several novel polyhydroxylated indolizidines, which were discovered to have inhibitory activity, is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Imidazolium Salt as Dual Lewis Acid and Redox Catalyst for the Aerobic Synthesis of Quinazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low transition temperature mixture formed with &#160;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(methoxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium chloride and iron(III) chloride has proven to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of quinazolines following a sequence of condensation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;oxidation reactions. The protocol is simple and effective for coupling 2&#8208;acylanilines and benzylamines to form nitrogen containing heterocycles with moderate to excellent yields (up to 93%), being possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale. The functionalized imidazolium salt is crucial for the activation of the reagents under solvent&#8208;free conditions, and the presence of iron in the&#160;catalyst mediates the oxidation step with atmospheric oxygen. These features make the presented procedure better, from an environmental point of view, than other processes previously described. For this comparison, different "green" metrics have been used, such as atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, E&#8208;factor and EcoScale.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes as Support for Pd Nanoparticles: a Recyclable System for the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes have been covalently functionalized with catechol moieties through the formation of the corresponding aryl radicals obtained by reacting 4&#8208;aminocatechol with isoamyl nitrite. The functionalized multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes have been in turn used to immobilize Pd(II) ions on its surface forming catechol&#8211;Pd complexes, which were reduced to Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so&#8208;obtained hybrid material has been characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This latter technique allowed to estimate the nanoparticle size (5.7 &#177; 2.8 nm) whereas a palladium loading of 20.3 wt% has been found by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The carbon nanotube&#8208;catechol&#8211;Pd hybrid was used as catalyst in two C&#8211;C coupling reactions, namely Suzuki and Heck reactions, resulting recyclable for at least 9 times in the latter process. During the reuse Pd nanoparticles increase their dimension to 19.3 &#177; 11.7 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;mediated C4&#8208;selective C&#8208;H&#8208;sulfonylation of pyridine.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct regioselective C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of simple, unfunctionalized pyridines is considered a long&#8208;standing challenge in heterocyclic chemistry. Herein, we report a novel one&#8208;pot protocol for the C4&#8208;selective sulfonylation of pyridines via triflic anhydride (Tf2O) activation, base&#8208;mediated addition of a sulfinic acid salt and subsequent elimination/rearomatization. Contrary to previous approaches employing tailored blocking groups, positional selectivity can be controlled by using N&#8208;methyl piperidine as simple, readily available external base. This method offers a highly modular and streamlined access to C4&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious Synthesis of a Glycopeptide Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactor design with optimized reaction conditions provides a route for glycopeptides synthesis within minutes by using equimolar quantities of glycosylated amino acids. This enabled the assembly of a proteoglycan&#8208;derived glycopeptide library in a matter of hours.







Abstract
Short proteoglycan fragments are of great importance for biochemical research. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis of such glycopeptides relies on excessive use of glycosylated amino acids, extended reaction times, and additional post&#8208;assembly deprotection protocols. We employed high&#8208;shear mixing for expedient and equimolar O&#8208;glycopeptide assembly. We further developed a stirring&#8208;based deprotection on the solid support, thus completing the synthesis of a glycopeptide library in a minimal amount of time and purification hurdles.

         <title>Synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes containing a H&#8208;bond between the encapsulated water molecule and the amide moiety on the rim of the orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Further hydrolysis of an open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with an epoxy moiety on the rim of the orifice led to the formation of a new open&#8208;cage fullerene with a 17&#8208;membered orifice and an amide group directly above the orifice. The water encapsulation ratio in the new open&#8208;cage compound reached 100% as a result of heating with water at 80 O C. The amide group above the orifice completely blocks the opening and forms H&#8208;bond with the trapped water molecule. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure shows that the bond length between the trapped water oxygen and the amide oxygen is 2.859 &#197;. The H&#8208;bond energy is about &#8208;3.83 kcal/mol as shown by theoretical calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Functionalization of the Octreotide Peptide Macrocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of the disulfide bridge by other types of side chain linkages has been a continuous endeavor in the development of cyclic peptide drugs with improved metabolic stability. Octreotide is a potent and selective somatostatin analog that has been used as an anticancer agent, in radiolabeled conjugates for the localization of tumors and as targeting moiety in peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe an on&#8208;resin methodology based on a multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the substitution of the disulfide bond by a tertiary lactam bridge functionalized with a variety of exocyclic moieties, including lipids, fluorophores, and charged groups. Conformational analysis in comparison with octreotide provides key information on the type of functionalization permitting the conformational mimicry with the bioactive peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis and Chemoinformatics: A Fruitful Synergy towards Better Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In these two decades, Diversity Oriented Syntesis (DOS) has evolved significantly. A shift in the focus of DOS library design was observed, passing from structural diversity to biological relevance. New approaches have been developed taking advantage of chemoinformatics tools, in order to increase the biological outcome of the library.







Abstract
In these two decades, Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis (DOS) has changed significantly: from the historical focus on structural diversity, new approaches have been developed in order to increase the biological outcome of the molecules within the library, such as the privileged&#8208;based DOS or the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Fluorescence Library Approach (DOFLA). In this context, chemoinformatics can assist organic chemists in identifying biologically&#8208;relevant regions of the chemical space not yet explored. Also, chemoinformatics tools can be used to graphically visualize and/or predict the structural diversity and complexity of the compounds within the library. This review highlights the improvement that DOS has received from chemoinformatics, presenting recent articles (published between 2016 and 2021) in which DOS libraries are analysed by chemoinformatics tools.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8208;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a blueprint for the design of a multivalent ligand of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN. The compound features a tetravalent rigid scaffold that enables for the multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion. This molecular architecture achieves strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over the C&#8208;type lectin langerin, which is characterized by a distinct spatial arrangement of the carbohydrate recognition domains. Cover&#160;design by Mr. Francesco Frullini. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fieschi, A. Bernardi et&#8197;al.

         <title>Annelated Pyridine Bases for the Selective Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acylation of primary over secondary hydroxyl groups in 1,2&#8208;ethanediols depends strongly on size effects and noncovalent interactions between the alcohol side chains and the catalysts surface.







Abstract
A set of 24 annelated derivatives of 4&#8208;diaminopyridine (DMAP) has been synthesized and tested with respect to its catalytic potential in the regioselective acylation of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates. The Lewis basicities of the catalysts as quantified through quantum chemical calculations vary due to inductive substituent effects and intramolecular stacking interactions between side chain &#960;&#8208;systems and the pyridinium core ring system. The primary over secondary hydroxyl group selectivities in catalytic acylations of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates depend on the size and the steric demand of the Lewis base and the anhydride reagent.

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S-trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized S-aryl S-perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

Allylation of aldehydes is possible by a real photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.







Abstract
Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.

A conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall was facilely synthesized. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by different techniques. Its photophysical properties and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices were further studied.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices.

&lt;/b&gt;) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The structure of &lt;b&gt;[9]CPPH&lt;sub&gt;2,11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed by HR-MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom-up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole- and electron- transport devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaching Room&#8208;Temperature Mesomorphism through Expansion of the Tristriazolotriazine Core with Alkoxybenzoate Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and efficient form of derivatization of the TTT center is presented, where the self&#8208;assembly was enhanced upon the introduction of benzoate groups to the core, drastically lowering the transition temperatures and increasing the mesomorphism range.







Abstract
The tristriazolotriazine (TTT) N&#8208;heterocycle, despite being a relatively new mesogenic core for use in discotic liquid crystals, has already demonstrated its importance and promising characteristics. In this work, we extended the knowledge about the TTT, increasing the core size with alkoxybenzoate units, as well as evaluating how the expansion and number of peripheral chains affected the thermal and photophysical properties, both in solution and spin&#8208;coated films. Their thermal behaviour and self&#8208;assembly were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, while the photophysics was investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that, despite a considerable decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield with the core expansion, the mesomorphic properties are significantly enhanced, with two products showing Colh mesophase at room temperature, with large range of mesomorphism and very good thermal stability. It was also demonstrated how structural changes affected the self&#8208;assembly properties.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Isosorbide Imidates by Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regiodivergent synthesis of exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates containing biologically relevant N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzothiazole, benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole) has been achieved by oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis starting from aldimine starting materials. A large library of unprecedented high value&#8208;added products has been obtained with good levels of yield and regioselectivity.







Abstract
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;promoted regiodivergent protocol for exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates synthesis is described. The disclosed strategy allows the straightforward synthesis of monoimidate&#8208;isosorbides (MIIs) endowed with the biologically relevant benzothiazole (BTA) moiety under mild oxidative conditions, starting from easy&#8208;accessible aldimines. Process optimization encompassed the use of stoichiometric diquinone as well as atmospheric oxygen as oxidant species, focusing on reaction dichotomy between oxidative and oxygenative pathways. The reaction scope was investigated on a representative selection of BTA&#8208;containing aldimines and further extended to congeners bearing different biologically pivotal N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole), observing good levels of yield (up to 87&#8201;%) and regioselectivity (exo/endo up to 10.0; endo/exo up to 7.0). Furthermore, the employment of an immobilized&#8208;NHC under heterogeneous conditions was assessed, showing satisfactory selectivity towards exo&#8208;MIIs (exo/endo=3.8). Overall, the methodology presented provided an unprecedented collection of high value&#8208;added products with potential applications in different fields.

         <dc:description>
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one&#8208;pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The combination of a N&#8208;phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity. The reaction scope was investigated with a range of aromatic aldehydes and the corresponding vinylene carbonates were obtained with 32&#8211;86&#8201;% isolated yields (14&#8197;examples).

Abstract
Alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;propargyl phthalimides were used as valuable building blocks for the selective formation of the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The key factors addressing the product selectivity control were determined. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were tested. Reaction mechanisms of the different reaction pathways are assumed.

&lt;p&gt;Alkyl- and aryl-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-propargyl phthalimides were used as valuable building blocks for the selective formation of the corresponding &#945;-fluoro, &#946;-phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;-difluoro, &#946;-phthalimido ketones or &#946;-phthalimido &#945;-diketones by means of gold-catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The key factors addressing the product selectivity control were determined. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido-protecting group were tested. Reaction mechanisms of the different reaction pathways are assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This work reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA residues. The desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group.







Abstract
The manuscript reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy with rational protecting group manipulations. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA and the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc residues. The introduction of the desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group on the protected trisaccharide. 1,2&#8208;cis aminoethyl glycoside with central glucosamine is used at the reducing end to the leave the scope for further glycoconjugate formation with suitable aglycone without hampering the anomeric stereochemistry.

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 29, August 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent antagonists able to reach the four carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of DC&#8208;SIGN have been prepared. The extended rigid core of these glycodendrimers allows multivalent presentation of glycomimetic molecules in a spatially defined fashion, providing high affinity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and selectivity over other C&#8208;type lectins featuring distinct CRD arrangements. The constructs successfully inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and DC&#8208;SIGN mediated trans&#8208;infection by Ebola virus.







Abstract
Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. In this work, we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus trans&#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Cycloaddition/Annulation Reactions by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric cycloaddition/annulation reactions have contributed greatly to the synthesis of a variety of novel cyclic compounds used in organic synthesis, natural product synthesis, material science, and chemical biology. Thus, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition reactions have received the attention of synthetic community to design new vital asymmetric reactions and synthesize complex molecules for the past two decades. Although several review articles on organocatalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition reactions can be found in the literature, there has been no specific review on CPA&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition/annulation reactions. Herein, the most recent research progress on chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric [3+2], [4+2], [2+2], [3+3], [4+3], [4+1] annulation and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions have been compiled and analyzed to demonstrate the importance of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in asymmetric cycloaddition or annulation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzothiazinones are a structural motif found in biologically active compounds, such as the clinical candidates BTZ&#8208;043 and Macozinone for the treatment of tuberculosis. We describe a robust, two&#8208;step method to synthesize 2&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted benzothiazinones from benzoyl thiocarbamates, which were prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure from benzoyl chlorides. The intramolecular cyclization and ethoxy displacement steps were also amenable to adoption in continuous flow as exemplified by select substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of a Bioactive Lignanamide Using a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;Type Cyclization of Activated Cyclopropylcarbinols and Synthetic Support for the Reaction Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide with high enantiomeric excess was accomplished. The key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a D&#8722;A cyclopropylcabinol, which proceeds with a very high level of stereoinduction. Based on the obtained experimental evidence, a feasible mechanism for the crucial 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization is proposed.







Abstract
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide was achieved with high enantiomeric excess. Key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization that proceeds with a very high degree of stereoinduction. The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. Based on these experimental results, the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an SN1 mechanism with high trans&#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation of (i)&#8197;the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an SN2 mechanism and/or (ii)&#8197;a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an SN1&#8208;like mechanism.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Azidation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic azides have found wide application in various fields of science and technology. This review summarizes recently developed approaches to the direct, one&#8208;step synthesis of diverse organic azides utilizing hypervalent iodine reagents. The first part of review deals with the azidation using unstable azidoiodinanes generated  in situ  from common hypervalent iodine reagents (such as diacetoxyiodobenzene or iodosylbenzene) and a source of azide anion (TMSN3  or NaN3  ). The second part of review is dedicated to the application of stable azidobenziodoxoles as useful azidating reagents that allow selective direct azidation of C&#8208;H bonds or double carbon&#8208;carbon bonds under mild reaction conditions. The use of azidobenziodoxoles eliminates the main disadvantages of the traditional approaches to organic azides, such as the need in pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates and harsh reaction conditions. Synthetic application of azidobenziodoxoles made possible direct selective azidation of a plethora of organic substrates including complex molecules at the late synthetic stage.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;H Activation Based Functionalizations of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Furfural and related compounds are building blocks of industrial interest, obtained from renewable raw biomasses containing C5&#8208; and C6&#8208;monosaccharides. In recent years, their use as precursors of basic and fine chemicals has gained increasing attention as a green alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived compounds. Several works have reported the functionalization of furfurals to obtain a wider range of chemicals, opening up new synthetic possibilities and applications, ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Among these works, processes based on C&#8211;H activation are the most attractive ones for their atom economy and the possibility to use non&#8208;activated substrates. This minireview summarizes the reported methods of direct transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. In particular, the selective functionalization of each C&#8211;H bond of the heteroaromatic nucleus of these molecules is systematically discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mannich Reaction: An Alternative Synthetic Approach for Various Pyrrole&#8208;Based Anion Receptors and Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented review highlights the synthetic development of structurally diverse pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases. The Mannich reaction approach discussed here serves as an alternative reaction strategy compared to the conventionally employed condensation reactions. Applications of Mannich bases as anion receptors, chelating ligands, and precursors for further reactions are described.







Abstract
This review article highlights the synthetic design of various pyrrole&#8208;based acyclic, tripodal, macrocyclic, and macrobicyclic Mannich bases and their applications, mainly as anion receptors. By varying the amine&#8208;types and molar proportions of reagents, a range of value&#8208;added Mannich bases are obtained. Herein, the synthesis and properties of several azacalixpyrroles, azacalixdipyrrolylmethanes, and azacryptands are discussed. Emphasis is also given to the applications of pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases in the construction of some chelating ligands as one of the steps in multistep organic syntheses. In addition, the use of Mannich products as ligands for synthesizing metal complexes is also described. More importantly, the establishment of Mannich reactions as an alternative approach for traditionally used Schiff's base or aldehyde/ketone&#8208;condensation reactions is delineated.

         <dc:description>A series of&#160;L&#8208;lyxo&#160;and&#160;L&#8208;xylo&#8208; pentofuranose&#8208;mimetic iminosugars and derivatives were efficiently synthesized in a stereoselective manner, through a concise strategy which involves an organocatalyzed Mannich reaction of an imine and a protected dioxanone as key step, using&#160;D&#8208;proline as catalyst. A prelimiary evaluation of their activity as potential anti&#8208;trypanosomal agents was studied.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Racemic Cyclic Allyl Bromides with Organolithium Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organolithium reagents are one of the most widely used reagents in chemical synthesis. Herein, we reported the first study of organolithium reagents used in asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) reactions with racemic cyclic substrates. A simple and efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cycloalkene derivatives from various racemic cyclic allylic bromides was developed. The standard method employed 5% CuBr&#183;SMe  2  in combination with phosphoramidite ligand  L2  in DCM. Meanwhile, transfer of the reactions into flow condition for more convenient application was also studied. This new Cu&#8208;catalyzed protocol was speculated to undergo an enantioconvergent transformation mechanism here.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethylated Indolopyranones through Regioselective Annulation of Indole Carboxylic Acids with Unsymmetric Internal Trifluoromethylated Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cross coupling/annulation of indole carboxylic acids with unsymmetric internal trifluoromethylated alkynes was accomplished for direct access to diverse trifluoromethylated indolopyranones, which combined indole, pyranone and trifluoromethyl, three valid pharmacophores, into one molecule. Both indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids proved to be suitable reaction partners with good functional group tolerance. Excellent regioselectivity was dominated by electron difference of unsymmetric alkynes. Moderate to good yields, high efficiency and atom economy were achieved for a broad substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylamine derivatives are biologically relevant compounds widespread in Nature, but the synthesis of this motif has been little addressed and its access with control of configuration at the anomeric carbon is challenging. Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric  N  &#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which can be conveniently trapped by one&#8208;pot nucleophilic addition with alcohols or amines to afford  N  &#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas, respectively. The rearrangement follows a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic pericyclic mechanism as illustrated by the stereospecificity of the reaction, with nitrogen being delivered at the anomeric position to the same face from which the oxygen at C&#8208;3 has departed. Thus, glucal and galactal give &#946;&#8208;  N  &#8208;glycosides exclusively while allal furnishes &#945;&#8208;  N  &#8208;glycosides.  cis  &#8208;Dihydroxylation of the synthesized unsaturated  N  &#8208;glycosides afford different 1&#8208;aminosugars with good selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared and Dual Emissions of Diphenylamino Group&#8208;Substituted Malachite Green Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel triarylmethanols and triarylmethyl cations with diphenylamino groups were designed and synthesized. The triarylmethyl cations exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in toluene solution, solid film state, and polystyrene (PS) film. The emission intensities of the triarylmethyl cations were strongest in the PS film. The relative quantum yield of the PS film increased as the number of diphenylamino groups increased. In addition, triarylmethanols exhibit dual emission in their aggregated state owing to the intermolecular interactions between triphenyl amine moieties and/or hydroxy groups. These findings are interesting because NIR and dual emissions are not observed in the dimethylamino group&#8208;substituted triarylmethyl cation, which is referred to as the &#8220;malachite green,&#8221; and the corresponding triarylmethanol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of Lithium Phosphine Oxides bearing an Alkyne chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of functionalized alkynyl phosphine oxides is described. The current approach is based on the activation of the phosphorus&#8211;hydrogen bond (P&#8211;H bond) of a secondary phosphine oxide. After the deprotonation step using  n  &#8208;butyllithium, the  in&#8208;situ  generated LiP(O)RR&#8217; undergoes further condensation with a wide variety of electrophiles, and without a cyclisation step into the alkyne as a side reaction. In particular, the addition to aldehydes proceeds quickly and gives access to  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxy phosphine oxides, with a diastereoselectivity rate up to 80/20.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation of the Thorpe&#8208;Ingold and Reactive Rotamer Effect by Using the Formation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geminal dialkyl effect is widely used in organic synthesis to promote cyclization reactions, although the exact origin of its rate enhancement remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate the applicability of this effect for the intramolecular formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions and assign it to angle contractions provided by introduction of sterically demanding substituents. Due to the cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines the acceleration of this ring closure cannot be explained by an increased population of reactive gauche rotamers and therefore agrees with the original Thorpe&#8208;Ingold theory. Furthermore, introduction of strained aliphatic rings resulted in internal angle expansions and were accompanied by a preliminary decrease of rate constants for the investigated aziridinium ion formation. These results lead to a linear correlation between internal angle and relative reaction rate, supported by computational and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[n]arenes in Action: Recent Applications in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of calix[  n  ]arenes as organocatalysts has increasingly been considered a prime focus due to their adjustable three&#8208;dimensional molecular structure, easy synthesis, and versatile structural modification at the upper and lower edges. For instance, these macromolecules have been described as efficient catalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions, asymmetric Michael addition, esterification and transesterification, dehydration, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and multicomponent reactions. Furthermore, calix[  n  ]arenes also tolerate aqueous or solvent&#8208;free reaction systems and can be supported on solid and/or magnetic particles, showing cost, time and energy savings, easier experimental procedures, and chemical waste reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Halocyclized Products by Using Various Catalysts: A State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogens play a crucial part in synthetic organic chemistry. The excellent electrophilicity properties and the leaving group abilities are responsible for the activation and structural derivation of various organic compounds. The cyclization reactions in the presence of halogens allow the researchers to construct diverse carbocycles and heterocycles. The halogen&#8208;induced cyclization reactions work very well under mild reaction conditions and do not produce any side products. The halogen&#8208;controlled transformations are very stereoselective and hold huge importance in asymmetric organic transformations. The halo&#8208;cyclized products hold numerous applications in the pharmaceutical industries, agrochemicals, natural product synthesis, and material chemistry. Thus, this review will discuss the role of various catalysts, such as from metal&#8208;catalysts to organocatalysts, under different conditions to synthesize various halocyclized products. The synthesis and catalytic mechanisms underlying the different asymmetric transformations will also be covered by emphasizing the enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, and regioselectivities from the existing pieces of literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)amine&#8208;Based Ion Pair Receptors for Selective Lithium Salt Recognition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tripodal ion pair receptors 1 and 2 consisting of tris(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)amine as a cation binding site linked with nitrophenyl urea or amidonitroindole groups as anion binding motifs have been synthesized. 1 H NMR spectroscopic analyses carried out in 10% DMSO in acetonitrile revealed that both ion pair receptors 1 and 2 are able to bind the LiCl ion pair with high selectivity over NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl. 1 H NMR spectroscopic analyses in combination with molecular mechanics calculations proved that the lithium cation is bound to the tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)amine subunit while the chloride anion interacts with the NHs of urea or amido indole groups via hydrogen bonds. The addition of fluoride to the lithium cation complexes of receptors 1 and 2 leads to the release of the lithium cation from the receptors whereas chloride and bromide are co&#8208;bound with lithium forming LiCl and LiBr ion pair complexes, respectively. The affinity of receptor 1 for the lithium cation was found to be improved by 5.0&#8208;fold when the counter anion of Cl &#8208; is co&#8208;bound within the receptor.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric &#947;&#8208;boryl substitution of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkenes has been investigated. A variety of substrates were reacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron in the presence of a copper(I) salt and optically active  C  1  symmetric QuinoxP*&#8208;type bisphosphine ligand as the catalyst. The optically active silyl&#8208;substituted&#160;  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylboronates products bearing a stereogenic C&#8211;B bond, which have never been synthesized before, were obtained in good yield with high enantioselectivity (up to 83% and up to 86% ee, respectively). The resulting allylboron compounds undergo a stereoselective allylboration with a range of aldehydes to afford chiral silyl&#8208; and difluoromethylene&#8208;containing homoallylic alcohols without significant loss in their enantiomeric purity. The resulting silyl groups in the derivatives can serve as cross&#8208;coupling sites, allowing further transformation into structurally complex fluorinated chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Angelica Lactone Catalysed Oxidation of Pyrrolidines to Lactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient protocol for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactams from pyrrolidines and oxygen. The strategy follows a two&#8208;step process involving an initial generation &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals from pyrrolidines and oxygen in presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) followed by trapping of the radical with oxygen species. This protocol demonstrates good functional group acceptance and provides a direct method to access &#947;&#8208;lactams. The lactam derivatives were obtained in up to 98% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Parallel Screening with 14C&#8208;Labeled Carbon Dioxide: De&#8208;risking the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates how radiolabeling using 14C&#8208;labeled CO2 was used to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig reaction, as a general methodology for the direct functionalization of CO2. In the presence of various additives, it easily allowed for the identification of side reactions, leading to the preparation of thiocarbamates. Cover design by Antoine Sallustrau.

         <title>DNA&#8208;templated formation and N,O&#8208;transacetalization of N&#8208;methoxyoxazolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;templated formation and N,O &#8208;transacetalization of N &#8208;methoxyoxazolidines have been studied. Compared to the reaction without a DNA&#8208;catalyst, the hybridization&#8208;driven N &#8208;methoxyoxazolidine formation shows a marked rate acceleration, whereas the rate of corresponding N,O &#8208;transacetalization is limited by the rate of decay to aldehyde intermediates. In both cases, the equilibrium yield increases markedly on the DNA template. Different hairpin architectures have been studied to evaluate the role and limits of the template effect. Furthermore, an attention has been paid to stereochemical integrity ( R/S ) of the N &#8208;methoxyoxazolidine linkage. The N &#8208;methoxyoxazolidine formation represents a dynamic pH&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;templated ligation that occurs readily in slightly acidic conditions (pH 5).</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of C&#8208;H and N&#8208;H Bonds: a Hydrogen Evolution Strategy for the Construction of C&#8208;N Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The progress in C&#8208;N bond construction is significant in synthetic and biological chemistry. Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of C&#8208;H and N&#8208;H motifs serve as a unique class of the most atom&#8208;economical and straightforward strategies for constructing C&#8208;N bonds. Herein, we enclosed the most updated methodologies developed in the assembly of C&#8208;N bonds  via  photo&#8208;catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, electrochemical and metal&#8208;free amination and amidation reactions of saturated and unsaturated C&#8208;H bonds. Compared with the well&#8208;established transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed protocols, electricity or visible light&#8208;mediated amination and amidation reactions are competent and appealing. Plausible mechanistic pathways are also described in representative amidation and amination reactions to provide insights for the future development of environmentally kind processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Bound Halogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent organocatalysts utilizing halogen bonding have emerged in the last decade as efficient alternatives to more established hydrogen bonding donors. However, currently they often cannot be recycled and, in some cases, even stoichiometric amounts need to be used. Herein, we present the first generation of recyclable, polymer&#8208;bound halogen bonding catalysts which are able to catalyze a halide abstraction reaction. To this end, bis(benzimidazolium)&#8208;based halogen bonding units were attached to a polystyrene polymer, yielding insoluble catalysts. These could be recycled up to three times with little loss in catalytic activity. The overall performance of the catalysts is comparable to that of a free (non&#8208;polymer&#8208;bound) halogen bond donor. Interestingly, catalysts featuring a preorganized and a non&#8208;preorganized halogen bond donating unit showed comparable activity, in contrast to the situation of the free donors. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study provides the basis for further steps towards more sustainable halogen bonding organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Photocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Oxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes Promoted by Benzeneseleninic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzeneseleninic acid was used under visible light irradiation (white LEDs) to promote the oxidative cyclization of  N  &#8208;propargyl amides to the respective 2&#8208;substituted oxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes. A total of twelve 2&#8208;aryl oxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes, six of them so far unprecedented, were prepared in 30&#8208;90% yield in just 1 hour of reaction at room temperature. No metal catalysts, nor strong oxidants or heating were necessary, making this a mild method to access a valuable class of compounds. The only co&#8208;products are water and diphenyl diselenide, that can be recovered and converted to new benzeneseleninic acid for a new reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and operationally straightforward synthesis of 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;arylethyne derivatives is described based on a desilylative Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and a silylated surrogate for methylthioacetylene (Me3SiCCSMe). Extension of the process to a selection of other thioether types is also documented.







Abstract
1&#8208;Methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;arylethynes were prepared in typically good to excellent yields from aryl iodides and 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)ethyne by a desilylative Sonogashira process employing Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), CuI (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), and K2CO3 (6 eq) in MeOH&#8208;Et3N&#8208;THF (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2) at rt for 16&#8197;h (16 examples, 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield). Thienyl and pyridyl iodides (all regioisomers) were similarly converted to 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;heteroarylethynes (5 examples, 54&#8211;82&#8201;% yield). The process was extended with similar results to comparable thioalkynes substituted on sulfur by n&#8208;alkyl, s&#8208;alkyl, and aryl groups.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aryl Lactams by Heck&#8208;Matsuda and Heck&#8208;Mizoroki Arylations of Enelactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective enantioselective arylation of enelactams using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands was accomplished by using arenediazonium salts or aryl iodides. The use of these distinct electrophiles allowed for the synthesis of several enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams in moderate to good yields in enantiomeric ratios of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. A rationale for the enantioselective process was constructed by an extensive investigation using DFT calculations.







Abstract
The chiral aryl lactam nucleus is a common motif present in many bioactive natural products and the development of effective enantioselective methodologies for its preparation is of great interest. In this work, we report the synthesis of several enantioenriched aryl lactams in good yields and enantiomeric ratios using a combined strategy employing arenediazonium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, aryl iodides with electron&#8208;donating substituents, and chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. The chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams were obtained in yields of up to 78&#8201;% and enantiomeric ratios up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands as a viable alternative to the phosphine&#8208;based ligands in the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Mizoroki reactions using aryl iodides. The origins of the enantioselectivity and the full catalytic cycle for the Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation of the enelactams were investigated through DFT calculations.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Ynenamides through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using gold(I) catalysts, terminal acetylenes bearing different substituents can be added to ynamides. The hydroalkynylation reaction is highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysis is a useful tool for C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. Of special interest is the hydroalkynylation reaction of alkynes, which provides a simple method for the synthesis of enynes representing interesting structural motifs in organic chemistry. So far, there are only a few examples of gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions. Herein, we were able to show experimentally that the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of ynamides leads regio&#8208; and stereoselectively to the corresponding ynenamides, a rather unknown type of molecule. A wide range of products could be generated with yields up to 90&#8201;% and, in contrast to many other gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne dimerization reactions, alkyl groups are tolerated. Quantum chemical calculations and NMR labelling experiments reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.

         <title>Polyazaacene and Cyclazaacene Precursors Synthesized by Dehydration Condensation from a Versatile Bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone Unit Having an Anthracene Skeleton</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azaacenes are acene analogs containing nitrogen atoms in their carbon&#8208;based molecular skeletons, and are attracting significant attention because of their potential application in organic electronics. However, polyazaacenes have solubility and stability issues. In this study, we report a modular approach employing 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4:8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(  1H  ,  4H  )&#8208;tetraone (  1  )  &#160;  as a key compound for &#960;&#8208;extension with commercially available materials to synthesize a series of polytetraazaacene thermal precursors. Exploiting this strategy, tetraazaheptacene, tetraazanonacene and tetraazaundecacene precursors were successfully synthesized. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the tetraazanonacene precursor can be converted to its corresponding tetraazanonacene in a nitrogen atmosphere. To extend the applicability of this method, compound  1  was also used to synthesize the cyclazaacene precursor at 0.8% yield. This approach provides a new perspective for exploring the synthesis of polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors by using a crucial key compound via dehydration condensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) Promoted Highly Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ortho&#8208;Nitration of Anilines Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and practical strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective ortho&#8208;nitration of aniline carbamates under mild and neutral conditions have been disclosed using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as a cheap nitrating agent. The electrophilic reaction exhibits a simple and straightforward pathway to obtain exclusively ortho&#8208;nitration products in good to excellent yields with outstanding functional groups tolerance for both electron rich and highly electron&#8208;deficient anilines. The highlight of this protocol is the role of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as a cheap nitrating agent that (Ce+4) via chelation with the directing group controls the regioselectivity of electrophilic nitration without the requirement of additional metal catalyst and external oxidant.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3,4,5&#8208;Tetra(hydroxyalkyl)pyrrolidines through 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions were conducted starting from azomethine ylides and enantiomerically pure sugar&#8208;derived dihydropyranones. The ylide intermediates were generated from imines obtained by condensation of glycine or L&#8208;alanine esters and 2,2&#8208;dimethoxyacetaldehyde. This aldehyde was employed as precursor of a dimethoxymethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring, instead of the usual aryl group derived from aromatic aldehydes. Under silver catalysis the cycloaddition was highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective, affording good yields of the 2,5&#8208;cis cycloadducts, with the endo configuration strongly prevailing. The enantioselectivity was controlled by the acetal stereocenter of the pyranone: the (S)&#8208;isomer gave a pyrrolidine with a defined configuration for the four asymmetric ring carbons, while the (R)&#8208;dihydropyranone gave the enantiomeric ring. A sequence of reactions applied to the cycloadducts derived from (S)&#8208;enone afforded the target 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetra(hydroxyalkyl)pyrrolidines. The enantiomers were obtained from cycloadducts synthesized from the (R)&#8208;enone. The pyrrolidines were evaluated as inhibitors of the &#946;&#8208;galactofuranosidase from Penicillium fellutanum.</dc:description>

         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship study onto six different BODIPY photocatalysts was performed towards a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction. The presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core was revealed to be essential for high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at the meso position deteriorated the catalytic performances, consistently with the proposed reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>NIS&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;H Oxidation of 2&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Benzamides
</title>

         <dc:description>
A new N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidation to construct C&#8722;O bonds has been developed. The reaction differs in the construction of the C&#8722;N bond from the classic and modified Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we describe the N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated benzyl sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted benzamide derivatives. This Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) type reaction involving intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;O bond formation differs from the construction of the C&#8722;N bond in the classic and modified HLF reactions. This reaction proceeded smoothly via 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer of N&#8208;centered radicals directly afforded by in&#8197;situ N&#8722;I bond generation, providing iminoisobenzofuran derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with exclusive chemoselectivity.

         <title>Stereocontrolling Effect of a Single Triisopropylsilyl Group in 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation with thioglucosides with a single triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group at O&#8208;2 is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective when weak nucleophiles (ROH) are used. Glycosylation proceeds along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via glycosyl cation, which is locked in 4H3 conformation with bulky TIPS group in the pseudo&#8208;equatorial position.







Abstract
Glycosylation with phenyl 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;2&#8208;O&#8208;triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective, while the use of 2,3&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS glucosyl donor with benzoyl groups at O&#8208;4 and O&#8208;6 results in the loss of &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity (&#945;/&#946;=3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol with 2&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS substituted glucosyl donors could only be achieved in glucosylation of weak nucleophiles. In this case, the glucosylation seems to proceed along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via the 4H3 conformer of glycosyl cation stabilized by the bulky TIPS group at O&#8208;2.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxyenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved route for the highly stereoselective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;oxyenamides is reported.

The desired products can be accessed in only three steps from aminoacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal as

common, readily available building block in a highly modular fashion. The improved procedure has been

applied to the synthesis of various acylated and sufonylated oxyenamides. Mechanistic and theoretical

studies provide a conclusive rationale for the observed stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergic Palladium Catalysis for Aerobic Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative coupling is a dehydrogenative organic transformation in which molecular oxygen acts as a re&#8208;oxidant for the catalyst system. Pd has emerged as one of the most popular transition metal catalysts for such reactions. Combinations of Pd with other transition metal catalysts can also provide effective catalytic cycles together with highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical organic transformations. A synergic Pd catalyst system can promote such reactions with a high degree of efficiency based on a re&#8208;oxidation step exhibiting improved kinetics in which two electrons are transferred from another transition metal. This occurs in conjunction with a lower energy barrier than that associated with direct re&#8208;oxidation by molecular oxygen. This review highlights recent developments in aerobic oxidative coupling reactions catalyzed by synergic combinations of Pd with other transition metals. Highlighted reactions include dehydrogenative C&#8208;C bond formation such as arylation of arenes, heteroarenes, alkenes and dehydrogenative C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O bond formations with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as alkenes, 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes. Moreover, mechanistic insights into these aerobic reactions based on experimental, computational and optical studies are detailed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Enaminones with p&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to 4H&#8208;Chromene and 4H&#8208;Chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of oxygencontaining heterocycles such as 4H&#8208;chromenes and 4Hchromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been established through the reaction of enaminones with  p  &#8208;quinone methides (  p  &#8208;QMs). This transformation basically involves an acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6conjugate addition of enaminones to  p  &#8208;QMs followed by annulation. In the case of reaction between 2hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted  p  &#8208;quinone methides and  N  ,  N  dimethyl enaminones, 4H&#8208;chromene derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. Similarly, the reaction between simple  p  &#8208;quinone methides and 2hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyl enaminones led to 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Isomerization of Unprotected Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Lewis Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of C5&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) to more Lewis basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including unprotected mNHO, MIC, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange reactions of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.







Abstract
Recently, novel C5&#8208;position&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids during experiments. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.

         <title>A Green Multicomponent Domino Mannich&#8208;Michael Reaction to Synthesize Novel Naphthoquinone&#8208;Polyphenols with Antiproliferative and Antioxidant Activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC50 values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.







Abstract
This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8211;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8211;47.95&#8197;&#956;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.

         <title>H&#8208;Bonded Counterion&#8208;Directed Catalysis: Enantioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition to 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones as a Case Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. The addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).







Abstract
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.

&lt;p&gt;H-bonded counterion-directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization-addition to 2-alkynyl enones. The addition of C-, N- or O-centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-bonded counterion-directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen-bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H-bonded counterion-directed catalysis to the Au(I)-catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization-addition reaction of 2-alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C-, N- or O-centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL-derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high-throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reassignment of Improbable Natural Products Identified through Chemical Principle Screening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure elucidation of complex natural products remains exceedingly reliant on a multitude of spectroscopic outputs, resulting in an elevated propensity to propose erroneous solutions. In this work concepts aimed to assist practitioners in identifying erroneous chemical structures are presented, along with nine examples to demonstrate approaches to solve and reassign natural product chemical structure employing a combination of CASE and DFT spectrum prediction with chemical intuition oversight.







Abstract
Natural products continue to be reported at an astonishing rate from a wide range of multidisciplinary research activities in the pursuit of understanding the chemistry of biodiversity. However, the elucidation of chemical structure in the modern era is heavily reliant on the analysis and interpretation of multiple spectroscopic outputs, and in most cases this activity is by no means trivial. Structural errors continue to be described given the inherent complexity of natural products. Computer&#8208;Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) continues to provide improved resolving power in this regard, but for enhanced accuracy quantum chemical spectrum prediction methodology is paramount. Reported herein are a range of counterfactual natural products, identified through chemical principal screening, which have been reassigned using a combination of chemical intuition, chemical synthesis, CASE and DU8+ spectrum prediction.

         <title>C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by well&#8208;defined copper and nickel complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This minireview presents well&#8208;defined copper and nickel complexes that have been used in the formation of C&#8208;S bonds. The use of Cu or Ni catalysts represent an advantage in comparison with those based on precious metals such as Pd, by being two of the most abundant metals in the earth&#8217;s crust and thus cheaper. As can be expected the catalytic activity of the different Cu and Ni complexes is strongly dependent on the nature of the ligands used. Thus, multidentate and strong electron&#8208;donating ligands are of common use to design highly active species since such ligands are capable to stabilize species in high oxidation states which are key intermediates in the reaction mechanisms of these processes. This being particular true in the case of copper, where Cu(III) produces unstable and reactive species that require an &#8220;extra stabilization&#8221; during the reaction mechanism. Hence, the reaction mechanisms using copper and nickel complexes as catalysts are also discussed in this paper, including the role of the different ligands during the catalytic processes. Although there are an increasing number of reports on C&#8208;S cross coupling reactions, due to the relevance of this transformation, they are often difficult to reproduce and not of general use due to the fact that the actual catalytic species are not identified, thus we hope that this report will help to promote the search and synthesis of new ligands for the design of more active well defined complexes that can be used as catalysts in a more rationale manner in the formation of valuable C&#8208;S bond containing species.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies Towards the Total Synthesis of Amycolamicin: A Chiral Auxiliary&#8208;Based Diels&#8208;Alder Approach towards the Decalin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective synthesis of (1  S  ,2  S  ,5  R  )&#8208;5&#8208;((4&#8208;methoxybenzyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;8&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a&#8208;octahy&#8208;dronaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (  2  ) is described, which comprises the bicyclic core structure of the natural product amycolamicin (  1  ). The bicyclic ring&#8208;system was established  via  an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a triene carrying a SuperQuat chiral auxiliary. The latter could be readily removed by methanolysis in excellent yield, which allowed for effective conversion of a hydroxy group at C(8) into the methylene group present in the natural product. The intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction could also be performed with a triene incorporating a classical, phenylalanine&#8208;derived Evans auxiliary, but the removal of the latter from the initial Diels&#8208;Alder product was hampered by competing attack of nucleophiles on the endocyclic carbonyl group in the oxazolidinone ring. Acid  2  could be converted into an acyl cyanide that features as a key advanced intermediate in one of the three total syntheses of amycolamicin reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Catalytic Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, synergistic dual catalysis has been in the spotlight as a robust strategy for carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. This review highlights the unique strategies of dual catalysis achieved in the past two decades, involving Pd&#8208;catalyst combined with various first&#8208; and second&#8208;row transition metals (like Cr, Fe, Cu, Ru, etc.), Lewis acids (based on Yb, Mg, Ti, Al, etc.) or organocatalysts (like squaramide, CPA, and NHC) to achieve valuable heterocyclic cores. Heterocycles find wide applications in pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Several organocatalysts like chiral phosphoric acid, NHC, squaramide, etc., and metal salts work in synergy with palladium to provide high&#8208;value products taking advantage of the vast development in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This review is a comprehensive collection of such dual&#8208;catalysis strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Properties of a Trigonal Iminoboronate Ester Cage Self&#8208;Assembled from Hexahydroxytriphenylene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (DAP), 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) into a trigonal&#8208;prismatic molecular cage through reversible iminoboronate ester motifs is reported. The organic cage generates solvates with acetonitrile and nitrobenzene, exhibiting vapochromic behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis evidenced the inclusion of nitrobenzene within the cage cavity. The resulting host&#8208;guest complex is stabilized by donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor interactions between the nitrobenzene guest and the &#960; electron&#8208;rich HHTP units of the cage.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, safe, convenient and efficient protocol for regioselective chlorination of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles with dichloro(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3  &#8208;iodanes has been developed under very mild conditions. The present approach avoids the need of toxic chlorinating reagents, strong stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts and harsh reaction conditions. And 36 examples of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycle substrates were investigated to deliver the chlorinated products with in moderate to excellent yields. Control experiments indicate that the chlorinated reaction proceeds through an electrophilic aromatic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Oxidation of Indoles Using Molecular Oxygen over a Copper Nitride Nanocube Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative transformation of indoles is a promising approach for synthesizing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds; however, conventional methods use toxic oxidants and additives. Herein, we report for the first time the catalytic oxidative trimerization and the oxygenative cleavage (Witkop oxidation) of indoles using molecular oxygen under additive&#8208;free conditions accomplished by a copper nitride nanocube (Cu3N NC) catalyst. The Cu3N NC catalyst exhibits excellent activity to produce various indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;ketoanilides with high functional group tolerance. Owing to this excellent catalytic performance, the Cu3N NC catalyst is distinguished from the conventional copper catalysts, demonstrating the high catalytic potential of metal nitride in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Terpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of terpenoids: An organocatalytic coupling and annulation methodology was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally complex cedrane scaffolds in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. It represents a highly economical, novel, and green method for the cedrane scaffolds synthesis.







Abstract
Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner. A combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions were used as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes with catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperatures for a few hours. This is a unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.

This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition&#8208;metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.

         <title>Phenanthrene&#8208;Embedded Carbaporphyrinoids and Related Systems: From Ligands to Cages and Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The review discusses the recent developments in the field of synthetic chemistry of PAH&#8208;porphyrin hybrids, emphasizing phenanthrene&#8208;embedded carbaporphyrinoids and related systems. The discussion covers various aspects of phenanthriporphyrin and its derivates chemistry, including their spectroscopic features, aromaticity, core reactivity, and coordination properties. The development of expanded phenanthriporphyrinoids is outlined, followed by the presentation of related carbaporphyrinoids incorporating hydrocarbon moieties such as fluorene, biphenyl, terphenyl, and dibenzo[  g  ,  p  ]chrysene. The exploitation of phenanthriporphyrinoids as a unique class of ligands for organometallic chemistry is discussed, with their use for the construction of conformational and stereochemical switches. The perspective for using related macrocycles as building blocks for carbaporphyrinoid cages is also outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Triphenylphosphine and Potassium Iodide system in the Decarboxylative Alkylation of 3&#8208;Cyanochromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylation of 3&#8208;cyanochromone using triphenylphosphine and potassium iodide as photoredox&#8208;mediators have been described. Low price of potassium iodide as well as triphenylphosphine compared to standard photocatalysts, made this method cost&#8208;effective and interesting. Visible light, cheap and readily available substrates, anhydrous solvent and inert atmosphere constitute the key parameters for the success of the developed transformation. The method allows for obtaining a number of products with very good yield and benefits from broad scope including both  N  &#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimides and 3&#8208;cyanochromones.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Hindered 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO) Emitters: Synthesis, Spectroscopic Studies, and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe various synthetic pathways to introduce sterically hindered substituents (mesityl, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl, anthracene) to the proton donor side of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;capable 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzoxazole (HBO) fluorophores. Two original synthetic approaches were investigated in order to synthesize seven HBO derivatives. Optimization studies concluded that electron rich and bulky phosphine ligands such as SPhos or S&#8208;bidime are required to ensure completion of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a bulky aromatic boronic acid. The photophysical properties of all dyes were evaluated in toluene, ethanol and in the solid&#8208;state. A strong influence of the nature of the solvent on the optical properties was evidenced, as protic solvents tend to stabilize enol tautomers and induce dual emission. Unlike the majority of organic dyes, ESIPT fluorophores do not undergo &#960;&#8208;stacking in the solid&#8208;state which led to a mild influence of steric hindrance. The nature of the excited&#8208;states was explored by  ab initio  calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Cuneanes through Enantioselective Constitutional Isomerization of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Cubanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Substituted cuneanes were obtained by metal&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubanes and are stable cage&#8208;like hexahedral compounds with C2v symmetry. In this process, the chiral cage&#8208;like hexahedral hydrocarbon in one step. The asymmetric induction was performed using chiral P&#8722;C&#8722;P pincer Pd catalyst. The obtained cuneane will be a novel chiral scaffold.







Abstract
2,6&#8208;Disubstituted cuneane has potential as a p&#8208;disubstituted benzene bioisostere and a novel chiral scaffold. It is a constitutional isomer of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane obtained via a metal&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement. Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6&#8208;disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing C2 symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd&#8208;pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.

Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4-disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6-disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd-pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics via Successive Vinylic/Aromatic C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic / aromatic carbon&#8211;fluorine (C&#8211;F) bond activation. The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of (1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl)biaryls with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208; endo &#8208; trig cyclization yielded 2&#8208;fluorobenzofurans (indoles) with a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. The obtained 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles underwent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8211;F/C&#8211;H coupling to yield tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacyclic heteroaromatics. This protocol allowed the synthesis of various substituted benzo&#8208;fused dibenzofurans and carbazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Thiiranes from Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes from alkenes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Thiiranes, the corresponding sulfur analogues of epoxides, are less studied and less encountered in literature. This might be due to the limited existing synthetic approaches for their synthesis. Herein, a mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized. Both aromatic and aliphatic moieties are well tolerated, leading to thiiranes in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical/experimental study is presented for a set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs). Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.







Abstract
A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) were synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment (&#956;0) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (Ea), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;0 and a lowering of the Ea value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8211;30&#8197;kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment.

         <title>Cyclization Strategies Using Imide Derivatives for the Synthesis of Polycyclic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main synthetic strategies to convert cyclic imides into polycyclic amine derivatives are revised. These synthetic routes have been classified according to their key features: N&#8208;acyliminium ions&#8208;based reactions, electrophilic activation of imides, use of strong nucleophiles, radicals&#8208;based methods, and miscellaneous strategies.







Abstract
Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods. This review is not comprehensive. It aims to provide the reader with a selection of representative synthetic strategies available in the area up to date.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

Condensation with 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde provides easy access to a protected phosphoramidite building block of (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol, used as the backbone scaffold in the synthesis of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane nucleic acids (MOANAs). The resulting N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane moiety is stable under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis but readily hydrolyzed afterwards. Stability of the protection can be adjusted predictably by changing the substituent on the phenyl ring.







Abstract
Dependence of the hydrolysis rate of a series of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinanes on the Hammett substituent constant of the substituent of the phenyl ring was determined, yielding a reaction constant &#961;=&#8722;1.40&#177;0.05. Based on this information, 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde was selected as a protecting group for a new (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol phosphoramidite building block. The yield of the preparation of this building block as well as its coupling in automated oligonucleotide synthesis were greatly improved compared to the method reported previously. The 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazine protection persisted throughout the synthesis of short oligonucleotides but was rapidly removed when the oligonucleotides were released from solid support and dissolved in water.

         <title>Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical reagents and methodologies (tools) employed for accurately and precisely programming over time the pH of a water solution are described in detail. For each tool, a number of selected examples is reported in order to show its feasibility and usefulness







Abstract
The chemical reagents used to achieve a predictable and programmable time control of the pH of water solutions are reviewed with the purpose to present a toolbox of instruments to be used when a precise pH vs time profile is needed. These tools are particularly useful in view of the growing interest on dissipative systems, many of which operate in water solutions, under the action of reagents (chemical fuels) that allow for programmed pH evolution. After a brief introduction describing the importance of such tools for the operation of dissipative systems in water, five sections follow, which illustrate the different method used so far to temporally control the pH of a water solution. In particular, time&#8208;programmable pH variations based on: 1) bubbling of gases (CO2, N2, Air), 2) hydrolysis of esters, lactones and sultones, 3) enzymatic and biocatalytic networks, 4) decarboxylation reaction of activated carboxylic acids, and 5) pH&#8208;oscillators are described together with selected examples of application.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Chlorodifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes by a Hypervalent Iodine EDA Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex enabling direct chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes is described. This method provides the privileged moiety with mild conditions across a broad range of functional groups and bioactive scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions and key control experiments are reported as well. The core EDA complex is studied spectroscopically, enabling further synthetic applications in the future.







Abstract
A novel EDA complex comprised of a bis(chlorodifluoroacetoxy)iodoarene and 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene is described, which enables the direct radical C(sp2)&#8722;H chlorodifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes under monochromatic visible&#8208;light irradiation. The procedure is mild, operationally simple, and utilizes commercially available reagents. The developed conditions demonstrate compatibility with a host of commonly encountered functionalities and biologically relevant scaffolds, whilst showcasing the post&#8208;functionalization capabilities of the &#8722;CF2Cl moiety. Various mechanistic studies were performed to explore the EDA complex and radical generation pathway.

         <title>Biocatalytic Kinetic Resolution to Access Enantiomerically Enriched Dihydropyrimidinone/Thiones through Recognition of a Remote Stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

         <title>Parallel Screening with 14C&#8208;Labeled Carbon Dioxide: De&#8208;risking the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA drugs.







Abstract
Carbon isotope labeling is a useful technology for tracking the fate of organic compounds in the environment and in living organisms. In this context, the development of robust and general methodologies amenable to the direct functionalization of CO2 remains a significant task. In this communication, a de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence for carbon isotope labeling. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA approved drugs.

A selective deconstructive strategy of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizines to hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed and applied to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of cuscutamine. Additionally, controversy of the absolute configuration of the natural products was clarified.







Abstract
The general approach for accessing to a tetracyclic hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;indolizino[8,7&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;one alkaloids is that what involves the construction of the &#947;&#8208;lactam ring from a tricyclic precursor. Here in this report, we disclose a new synthetic strategy that permits the direct deconstruction of the tetracyclic indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizine motif into the tetracyclic hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one scaffold of the naturally occurring (+)&#8208;cuscutamine without the use of either transition or precious metals. Additionally, the current total synthesis of both enantiomers provides structural clarification of the natural occurring alkaloid.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles was well established, which exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, this environmental&#8208;friendly methodology also finds application in the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH for the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmental&#8208;friendly process exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8722;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive computational study of the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism is reported. Up to 32 &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical/organic halide combinations are explored to understand the effect of the C&#8722;X bond, the influence of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical properties and the alkyl or aryl character of the reactive C center in the reactivity.







Abstract
Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8211;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents, although the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 32&#8197;reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8722;X and Cy&#8722;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Photocatalyzed Halogen&#8208;Radical Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis is a method of choice for the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Review collects the recent examples exploiting this manifold to generate highly aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. Available strategies to influence site&#8208;selectivity of the hydrogen atom transfer step have also been discussed.







Abstract
The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.

         <title>Robust Synthesis of Tetra&#8208;Boronate Esters Analogues and the Corresponding Boronic Acids Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and robust synthetic strategy that could build a series of tetra&#8208;boronate analogues in gram&#8208;scale is reported. Further, a universal deprotection condition that allows the direct transformation of tetra&#8208;boronates to their corresponding boronic acids is also included in this study.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications, because of their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkene Formation from Reductive Aldehyde Homo&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the PIII of a phosphanyl phosphonate reagent MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2 (see Figure) renders the reductive aldehyde coupling of aldehydes selectively for the thermodynamically less stable Z&#8208;olefin product.







Abstract
Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E&#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z&#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2, 6, with an electron&#8208;deficient MesF=2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z&#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient MesF, which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of MesF, the E&#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P&#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of the Z&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

     alt="Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape-selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme-like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

Room temperature, Liquid assisted grinding was used for the synthesis 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and atom economic process bearing wide substrate scope and the isolation of products is chromatography free. It shows an efficient application of mechanochemical synthesis and also exemplifies green chemistry.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

         <title>Remote Functionalization of 8&#8208;Substituted Quinolines with para&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to Unsymmetrical Tri(hetero)arylmethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient method for the preparation of unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes from para&#8208;quinone methides and derivatives of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline under copper catalysis is described.







Abstract
A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8-aminoquinoline derivatives with &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron-rich and electron-deficient substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

Based on SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed.







Abstract

Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.
