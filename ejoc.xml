         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of 7,20&#8208;Epoxy, 3,20&#8208;Epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;Kaurane Diterpenoids</title>

         <dc:description>The genus Isodon is a well&#8208;known traditional medicinal herb that serves as a rich source of cytotoxic ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids, which bear the same tetracyclic core of ent&#8208;kaurane with different oxygenation, bond&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement patterns. The 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids are the most studied subclass, which showed promising anti&#8208;cancer activities. Moreover, they also have the potential for transforming to other subclasses of ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids. Herein, we report the details of our study on developing a highly diastereoselective synthetic strategy for the 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoid (5 natural products) and its conversion to the 3,20&#8208;epoxy (2 natural products) and 6,7&#8208;seco derivatives (2 natural products). Our synthetic strategy features a thermal Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of the AB ring system, an intramolecular Mukaiyama Michael/carbocyclization cascade reaction for establishing the CD ring system, a site&#8208;stereoselective oxidation/reduction strategy for completion of the total syntheses of several representative 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids and the divergent syntheses of Isodon diterpenoids in the 3,20&#8208;epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco subclasses via bioinspired strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypodiboric Acid&#8211;Sodium Carbonate Mediated Reductive Cyclization of Nitro(hetero)arenes: Synthesis of Imidazopyridines, Benz(oxa/thia)zoles, Benzoxazolones and Benzoxathiones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hypodiboric acid&#8211;sodium carbonate mediated reductive cyclization of nitro(hetero)arenes has been developed for the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines, benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles, benzoxazolones, and benzoxathiones. The reaction demonstrates broad scope and is compatible with a wide range of functional groups. This protocol is highly efficient, allowing nitro compounds to directly participate in the reaction. Control experiments highlight the necessity of sodium carbonate as an additive. Using this methodology, biologically active compounds such as zolimidine, miroprofen, and chlorzoxazone were successfully synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Terminal Alkenes Catalyzed by a Scandium Metalloligand Supported Ni(0) Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported zero&#8208;valent nickel complex is reported. The resting&#8208;state complex containing a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Redox neutral catalytic cycles based on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is disclosed.

Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported Ni(0) complex are studied. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov products are obtained in 62&#8211;89% yield, along with the alkanes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenyldisilane as minor products. The resting&#8208;state complexes of hydrosilylation reactions are isolated and characterized by spectroscopic method and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which represent rare&#8208;example of Ni(0) silyl complexes supported by scandium ions via a Ni(0)&#8594;Sc(III) interaction. The catalytic cycle is proposed to be redox neutral with Ni(0) center, and is facilitated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving the Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation for Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Wittig&#8208;Type Olefination from Alcohols in Air</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot in situ alcohol oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction in air using aphosphine&#8208;free Fe(II) catalyst (1) bearing a redox&#8208;active tridentate arylazo pincer was used to synthesize a broad range of substituted E olefins by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Mechanistic investigations revealed active participation of the arylazo scaffold as an electron and hydrogen reservoir in the catalytic cycle.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem in&#8201;situ oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported for the synthesis of alkenes. Using a bench&#8208;stable Fe(II) catalyst with a redox&#8208;noninnocent 2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand scaffold, a broad spectrum of substituted E olefins is synthesized in good yields by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. Control reactions and spectroscopic studies indicate synergistic participation of the ligand, which acts as a reservoir of electrons and hydrogen, during the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with the phosphorus ylides.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation and Tandem Allylation&#8211;Cycloisomerization of Stannylated Propargyl Acetates with Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.

Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes.

&lt;p&gt;A mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5-enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5-enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. However, gold(I)-catalyzed 1,5-enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5-enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The catalytic system ((4-MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAuCl/AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5-enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)-catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes with high regiocontrol.

         <title>Improved Chemical Synthesis of Avenanthramides Family and its Analogs by Mixed Anhydride Method</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable phytochemicals, including avenanthramides A, B, C, E, and some analogs, have been rapidly prepared as carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives in acetone, achieving high yields by crystallization.. This process utilizes the mixed anhydride method with a triethylamine&#8208;isobutyl chloroformate reagent system. The protection can be readily removed on demand by treating it with morpholine in methanol for one hour, yielding almost quantitative amounts of free avenanthramides.

Amides derived from common hydroxycinnamic acids&#8212;including 4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dimethoxycinnamic acid, and 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxycinnamic acid&#8212;along with various free aminobenzoic acids, such as 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzoic acid, a key component of the avenanthramide family, have been rapidly synthesized using an innovative, environmentally friendly synthetic methodology. This approach, grounded in traditional chemistry, utilizes mixed anhydrides to simultaneously protect and activate hydroxycinnamic acids through the actions of triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate while employing acetone as a green solvent. The resulting amides, formed from the coupling with free aromatic amino acids, are constructed as O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives with high yields and purity, isolated directly via crystallization, thus eliminating chromatographic or HPLC purifications. Furthermore, free phenols can be conveniently released on demand using morpholine in methanol. Under these conditions, C&#8208;protected aromatic amino acids remain unacylated. This synthetic strategy represents a significant advancement over conventional acyl chloride methodologies, which often rely on toxic reagents and solvents and entail time&#8208;consuming and complex procedures. It enhances the production of important phytochemicals such as avenanthramides and opens doors to various analogs, paving the way for potential pharmacological applications.

         <title>Electroreductive Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Type Cyclization for the Synthesis of Benzofused Oxygenated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive strategy for synthesizing diverse benzofused oxygenated heterocycles via 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization. This method eliminates the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts while suppressing competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate tolerance, and improves atom economy.

Conventional synthetic routes to benzofused oxygenated heterocycles, such as dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives, often involve complex synthetic conditions, high costs, and environmental concerns. The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#63743;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, a convenient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free electroreductive tandem reaction is developed for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.

         <title>Assembly of Molecular Complexity by Carbene Organocatalytic Multi&#8208;component Reactions involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of molecular complexity is central to modern organic synthesis, as complex molecules are essential across various fields. The development of catalytic multi&#8208;component transformation strategies provides an efficient approach for the rapid and selective construction of complex molecular frameworks. Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool in multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs), enabling precise control over selectivity, stereochemistry, and functional group compatibility that significantly facilitate the assembly of complex molecular structures. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in carbene&#8208;catalyzed MCRs involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, with an emphasis on reactions incorporating three or more reactants. These transformations are categorized into electron&#8208;pairing and radical pathways, with a detailed discussion of their mechanisms, scope and limitations. Ultimately, this review aims to advance the development of catalytic strategies that leverage carbene organocatalysis to enable the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added molecules from simple precursors.</dc:description>

Especially the selective desulfurization of thioamides usually requires hazardous highly reactive reagents or transition metal catalysts in high&#8208;pressure conditions. Herein, we presented a novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system. Notably, the selectivity of the reaction was effectively controlled with a simple Lewis acid additive through computational design. The combination of DFT and experimental mechanism studies revealed the important synergistic cooperation by DMAB and Lewis acid additive to facilitate the hydrogenative desulfurization process in an aqueous solution.</dc:description>

A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed fluoro/fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium salt as a bifunctional reagent is described, which allows for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluoro sulfamoyl fluorides under mild conditions.

In this study, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;component &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes is demonstrated. The bench&#8208;stable reagent, N&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium tetrafluoroborate can be used as a photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursor and also as the fluoride source. This transformation can convert a series of styrenes to functional group&#8208;enriched products, including substrates with electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, as well as di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituents on the C&#63743;C double bond.

         <title>Benzochalcogenodiazoles, synthesis and applications in medicinal chemistry and photomedicine.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzochalcogenodiazoles BXDs (BOD: benzoxadiazole, BTD: benzothiadiazole, or BSD: benzoselenadiazole) are aromatic bicyclic compounds, containing chalcogen atoms, with applications ranging from material to medicinal chemistry. The recent developments in their preparation and functionalization are taking advantage of new methodologies such as C&#8208;H activation and photocatalysis. After being almost restricted to organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronics applications, they are gaining more and more interest in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatic fragments. Their unique optical properties make them attractive in biological imaging and in photomedicine, with emission up to the near infrared biological transparency window. The nature of the chalcogen atom influences their optical properties, with sulfur and selenium atoms favoring phototherapy over fluorescence. This review will not describe optoelectronic materials and fluorophores based on BXD but will focus on the preparation of BXD containing compounds, and their medicinal and photomedicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) are atom&#8208;economic, ecofriendly methods for synthesizing complex molecules. Palladium and other transition metals serve as efficient catalysts by enabling C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation, offering energy savings and chemical diversity. Pd&#8208;MCRs are highly valued in synthetic chemistry for their excellent stereoselectivity, chemoselectivity, and remarkable functional group tolerance.

Multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) involve the reaction of three or more compounds to yield a single product. Typically, MCRs are eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical processes, widely used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant compounds with diverse applications in both medicinal and synthetic chemistry. Nowadays, transition metals are widely used as catalysts in MCRs due to their exceptional ability to create both C&#8211;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Metal&#8208;catalyzed MCRs offer optimal chemical diversity, excellent atom economy, and energy savings.

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, stannous chloride catalyzed phosphorylation of alcohols and selective phosphorylation of carbohydrates are explored, giving a new approach to obtain biologically active phosphorylated molecules.

Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. Herein, the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates is demonstrated. Notably, the reaction efficiency is found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy is established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach is further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Promoted Direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se Bond Formation from Csp3&#63743;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the significant advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct chalcogenylation of Csp3&#63743;H bonds over the past decade (2014&#8211;2024). The discussion is organized by transition metal catalysts, with particular emphasis on mechanistic insights of these transformations. Additionally, the review highlights the direct incorporation of various sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing functional groups via diverse catalytic systems.

The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from C&#63743;H bonds has emerged as an efficient synthetic strategy for constructing previously inaccessible organochalcogen compounds, opening a new gateway to late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical&#8208;relevant molecules and organic functional materials. C&#63743;Y bonds (Y&#63742;S, Se, Te) also show outstanding strategic relevance as handles to access other valuable functional groups downstream in a synthetic route. Despite the significant progress, the chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and enantioselective C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from unactivated Csp3&#63743;H bonds is still challenging owing to its low polarity and inertness. Here, a comprehensive overview of the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct conversion of unactivated Csp3&#63743;H to C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bonds in the last decade is provided, looking to motivate the continuous discovery of innovative and efficient systems for these transformations.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the significant advancements in transition metal-catalyzed direct chalcogenylation of Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bonds over the past decade (2014&#8211;2024). The discussion is organized by transition metal catalysts, with particular emphasis on mechanistic insights of these transformations. Additionally, the review highlights the direct incorporation of various sulfur- and selenium-containing functional groups via diverse catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition metal-catalyzed direct C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Se bond formation from C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bonds has emerged as an efficient synthetic strategy for constructing previously inaccessible organochalcogen compounds, opening a new gateway to late-stage functionalization of pharmaceutical-relevant molecules and organic functional materials.

         <dc:description>
We rapid here a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction strategy for synthesizing unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;arenes from para&#8208;quinone methide (pQM) and arylhydrazine. This facile and straightforward base&#8208;mediated strategy tolerates a wide range of substrates and synthesizes several interesting azo&#8208;arenes in good yields with excellent stereospecificity. Additionally, DFT calculations are performed to support the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
A simple and straightforward method has been developed for the direct synthesis of unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;aryl compounds from p&#8208;quinone methide (p&#8208;QM) and arylhydrazine. This reaction strategy is executed in air under basic conditions and affords exclusively Z&#8208;isomers in good yields with a broad substrate scope. The stereochemistry of our synthesized azo&#8208;arenes has been confirmed by 2D&#8208;NMR analyses.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

The design of original disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The conditions are optimized and a wide range of boronic acids are used to determine the scope and limitations of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura or Chan&#8211;Lam reactions.

The design of some novel disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The series are developed from quinuclidinone, which afford versatile platforms bearing one lactam function in position C&#8208;2 that is then used to create C&#9472;N bond using the Chan&#8211;Lam coupling reaction or in&#8201;situ C&#9472;O bond activation via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The conditions are optimized and a wide range of boronic acids are used to determine the scope and limitations of each method. To complete this study, a flow Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura process is established to afford polyfunctionalized 1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives in high yields with a very efficient process (10 min).

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethyl Carboxylic Esters via Asymmetric Barbier Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Barbier reaction toward &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters is studied. Utilization of indium and (+)&#8208;cinchonine or (&#8211;)&#8208;cinchonidine as chiral additives gives access to both enantiomers. By using different allyl and propargyl bromides 10 different derivatives of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters are obtained in up to 81% yield and 98%ee.

Despite the occurrence of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester motif in many natural products, no attempt is made to synthesize this core structure via a racemic and enantioselective Barbier reaction. In this study, the optimized reaction conditions for the achiral Barbier reaction between allyl bromide and a 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxopropanoate are found, yielding the desired &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester in up to 64%. Therefore, different metals, additives, solvents, and solvent mixtures are tested. The optimized reaction conditions are then used to expand the substrate scope of the Barbier reaction by using five structurally different allylic and propargylic bromides. By using (+)&#8208;cinchonine and (&#8211;)&#8208;cinchonidine as chiral additives along with indium in a tetrahydrofuran/hexane solvent mixture, it is possible to obtain 10 different &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters in an enantioenriched fashion with up to 81% yield and 98%ee.

         <dc:description>An efficient access to 2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazin&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one via the nitro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of nitrobenzene with gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene is developed under mild reaction conditions. This strategy features good functional group tolerance, good to high yields and free of catalyst.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Three&#8208;Component Halophosphorothiolation of Enamides/Enoates for Regioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Halogenated Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates with P(O)SH compounds and NXS (X = Cl, Br) under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions has been demonstrated. This strategy readily affords an array of valuable amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in good to excellent yields, featuring with simple operations, diverse functional group tolerance and easy scale&#8208;up. Preliminary studies reveal that the electrophilic phosphoranesulfenyl chlorides/bromides generated in situ may be a key intermediate. Furthermore, phosphorothioated lactams can be easily obtained through the intramolecular substitution reaction of chlorophosphorothiolated amides. Notably, all of the tested products displayed potent and selective inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthesis of valuable 3&#8208;selanylindoles by selenylation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines under metal&#8208;free and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions is described. The reaction involves a radical pathway and features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and straightforward operation.

An electrocatalytic cascade selenylation/oxidation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines enables the assembly of various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;selanylindoles in one&#8208;pot under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. A series of functional 3&#8208;selanylindoles are smoothly furnished in acceptable yields. This electrocatalytic strategy is flexibly suitable for diverse diaryl diselenides and 2&#8208;alkenylanilines. This method is highlighted by broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, mild conditions, and easy operation. The preliminarily mechanistic experiments suggest that a radical pathway is probably involved in this protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing attention has been paid to nitrene transfer reactions as they afford a direct access to nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds of utmost interest in life and material sciences. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, organized by the protocols for the nitrene formation: direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes.







Abstract
Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8722;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes.

     alt="Recent Advances on Light-Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing attention has been paid to nitrene transfer reactions as they afford a direct access to nitrogen-containing compounds of utmost interest in life and material sciences. This review summarized the advances in photo-mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, organized by the protocols for the nitrene formation: direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8722;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco-friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible-light-mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo-mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;We report pyridine N&#8208;oxides as neutral ligands in cerium photocatalysis. By using those neutral ligands, photoactive Ce(IV)&#8208;species are generated, that show an extensive bathochromic shift compared to previously employed cerium&#8208;based complexes. This allows the effective utilization of green light in the redox&#8208;neutral CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules under very mild photocatalytic conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Treatment of Lawesson's reagent with selected alkyl or aryl alkynes results in the formation of cyclization products such as 3H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;dithiaphosphole&#8208;3&#8208;sulfide or unprecedented 1,3,2,4dithiadiphosphinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;disulfide derivatives.

Density functional computations (PW6B95D3/6311+G(d,p)&#8208;PCM(toluene)//B97D3/6&#8208;31G*) explain the formation of the dithiaphosphole product from alkynes and Lawesson's reagent via a sequence of [2+2] addition, electrocyclic ring opening, S&#8208;S&#8208;bond forming ring&#8208;closure and P(III)&#8208;oxidation by sulfur transfer from Lawesson's reagent. Based on DFT calculations the formation of a 1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiphosphinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;disulfide is rationalized by a sequence of cyclization, electrocyclic ring opening and dipolar cyclization steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Free Strategies for the Transformation of Amides into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review articulates the recent advances in transition metal&#8208;free methodologies for amide bond activation. By integrating mechanistic insights with synthetic applications, it delineates sustainable strategies for the construction of carbonyl frameworks. Emphasis is placed on nucleophilic substitution, radical&#8208;mediated processes, and catalyst&#8208;driven approaches, providing a valuable resource for the efficient transformation of amides into esters, ketones, imides, and aldehydes.

Amides are fundamental functional groups in organic synthesis and play crucial roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Traditionally, amide transformations have often relied on transition metal catalysts; however, recent advances have demonstrated efficient transition metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond activation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging methodologies that enable selective formation of C&#63743;N, C&#63743;C, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;H, and C&#63743;X bonds. Key developments that offer sustainable and practical alternatives to conventional approaches include borate&#8208; and boronic acid&#8208;mediated transamidations, phosphoric acid&#8208;promoted transformations, and radical&#8208;based strategies. Additionally, nucleophilic substitutions with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles have expanded the synthetic utility of amides by yielding diverse carbonyl and heterocyclic compounds. Mechanistic insights into these transformations reveal the role of electronic and steric effects in amide reactivity. By categorizing these methodologies based on amide substrates and reaction pathways, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking efficient, metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond manipulation.

         <title>Cu&#8208;catalyzed Bilateral Linkage of Sulfenamides for the Construction of Benzothiophene&#8208;based Cyclic Sulfilimines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed bilateral linkage of sulfenamides and diaryliodonium salts was developed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of Benzothiophene&#8208;based cyclic sulfilimines. The challenging cyclic sulfoximines can be efficiently obtained via subsequent oxidation. Photophysical properties and DFT calculations reveal that cyclic sulfoximines, compared to cyclic sulfilimines and sulfones, exhibit larger Stokes shifts and reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO orbital overlap.

Carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO demonstrated the effectiveness of structurally rigid planar COPV platform for full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism. Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 achieved a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) &#8805;0.90 in aprotic solvents, with a 0.74&#8197;eV shift between cyclohexane and methanol. [Ph&#8322;N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]&#8322;CO demonstrated lower PLQY but enhanced sensitivity to water content and extinction coefficient of up to 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism was demonstrated using two carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO with a push&#8211;pull system, where the donor and acceptor moieties are diphenylamino and a carbonyl group, respectively. In non&#8208;polar cyclohexane, the molecules exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#955;PL=443 and 464&#8197;nm) with a locally excited character, while in polar solvents, a charge&#8208;transfer character emerged. In methanol, red emission was observed (&#955;PL=602 and 572&#8197;nm). The difference in luminescence maxima between cyclohexane and methanol corresponds to 0.74 and 0.59&#8197;eV for Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO, respectively, which are larger than those of previously reported push&#8211;pull systems. The photoluminescence quantum yields of Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 in aprotic solvents were 0.90 and higher regardless of solvent polarity, while they decreased in protic solvents. The molecules also display high extinction coefficients of up to 2.8x104 and 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of structurally rigid planar COPV framework. Furthermore, [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO showed significant responses to water content in tetrahydrofuran&#8208;water mixed solvents, which highlights its potential for sensing applications.

         <dc:description>
A formal hydroamidation of alkynes to afford a broad range of &#945;&#8208;acrylamides is described. This method has various practical merits, including a mild reaction temperature and short reaction times. In addition, it allows the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the target compounds.







Abstract
The formal hydroamidation of alkyne is a powerful synthetic method that enables the formation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. In this article, the efficient formal hydroamidation of terminal and internal alkynes is described, which constitutes the Ni&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalumination of alkynes and subsequent treatment with isocyanates. This method is gram&#8208;scalable and the synthetic utility is highlighted by the synthesis of a &#946;&#8208;lactam from &#945;&#8208;phenyl acrylamide.

Abstract
Spirobenzoxazines are a unique class of heterocyclic compounds that combine the structural features of spiro and benzooxazine frameworks, offering enhanced chemical stability and diverse biological activities. Their rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures make them ideal candidates for interacting with biological targets, contributing to their potential in various therapeutic applications, including anticancer, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibition. However, the development of efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazines remains a challenge in organic synthesis. In this work, we present a novel and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazine derivatives. Utilizing water as a green solvent, this methodology offers an efficient and sustainable route for constructing these complex heterocyclic frameworks. By emphasizing eco&#8208;friendly practices, this approach aligns with the principles of green chemistry, providing both high yields and operational simplicity. This advancement not only highlights the potential of spirobenzoxazines in the pharmaceutical and material sciences but also paves the way for future research in sustainable synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work described the synthesis of stannylenoid 2 from dialkylstannylene and sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP). The stability of 2 in THF and its reactivity under irradiation, leading to the formation of compound 7, are investigated. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveals an Sn&#8322;P&#8322; four&#8208;membered ring, shedding light on stannylenoid reactivity and its synthetic potential.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid 2 through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid 2 exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, 2 undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound 7. The solid&#8208;state structure of 7, determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals a diamond&#8208;shaped Sn&#8322;P&#8322; moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8722;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Mechanochemical Dissociation of Singlet Carbene&#8211;CS2 Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical release of carbon disulfide (CS2) from singlet carbene&#8211;CS&#8322; adducts is explored. While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC) adducts exhibit complete conversion, cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) adduct undergoes decomposition. DFT calculations reveal how electronic structure influences CS2 release, offering insights into the reactivity of singlet carbenes&#8211;small molecule adducts.







Abstract
Owing to the extensive application of singlet carbenes, their generation through the release of small molecules from stable adducts is attracting increasing research interest. This study explores the mechanochemical release of CS2 from Carbene&#8211;CS2 adducts formed by three distinct singlet carbenes: cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC); N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC); and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC). Under ball&#8208;milling conditions, these adducts exhibit notably different reactivities; DAC&#8211;CS2 releases CS2 completely within 20&#8197;min, NHC&#8211;CS2 has a slower release rate, while CAAC&#8211;CS2 decomposes into a complex mixture. DFT calculations reveal that the release of CS2 from CAAC&#8211;CS2 requires the highest activation energy (32&#8197;kcal/mol), suggesting that it is inaccessible under the reaction conditions. This is likely because of the higher HOMO energy of CAAC, which correlates with a stronger bond with CS2, thereby limiting its dissociation. This study highlights how the electronic structures of carbenes influence their interactions with small molecules, paving the way for controlling the reactivity of carbene&#8211;small&#8208;molecule adducts.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of n&#8208;Nonanal and Aldehyde&#8208;Containing Polysiloxanes via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation Enhanced by A New Silicon&#8208;Tethered Multidentate Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two tetradentate P&#8208;ligands based on the 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (ViD4) and tetrakis(dimethyl(vinyl)silyl) silicate (SiV4) was reported for application in Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, which provide a facile process for the catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes and aldehyde&#8208;functional polysiloxanes with good regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes presents a significant challenge in homogeneous catalysis and organic synthesis due to the difficulty in regioselective control. Here we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed high chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene that would be highly useful intermediates in chemical industry. Notably, the easy made tetradentate P&#8208;ligands L1 and L2 can effectively suppress hydrogenation and isomerization reaction of olefins and give the desired aldehydes in high yield and good regioselectivity. Control experiments reveal the tetradentate P&#8208;ligands is important for controlling selectivity because the high regioselectivity is found to benefit from the presence of four phosphorus atoms manifesting in the formation of much more efficient coordination interactions to give relatively stable rhodium complexes.

         <title>Front Cover: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence Solvatochromism of Push&#8208;Pull Type Indenoindene Derivatives (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 16/2025)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows how full&#8208;color solvatochromic fluorescence has been achieved by using a push&#8211;pull type &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule (placed in the flask) featuring a rigid, planar indenoindene core as the fluorophore. The fluorescence quantum yield exceeds 0.90 in aprotic solvents, and the emission color ranges from blue to red depending on solvent polarity, as represented by the colored smoke in the flask.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition and Substitution Reactions with Grignard Reagents: Do We Know It All?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses advancements in catalytic asymmetric conjugate additions with Grignard reagents, emphasising both established knowledge and unexplored areas. Metal catalysis is crucial for forming enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. Key factors such as metal source, ligands, substrates, temperature, and solvent have been well&#8208;studied. Recent computational chemistry insights have elucidated reaction mechanisms and critical steps.







Abstract
Catalysis has been a cornerstone in organic synthesis, enabling a variety of highly efficient and selective C&#8722;C bond formation reactions, in particular enantioselective addition and substitution of Grignard reagents. Throughout time, we have gained significant understanding into how various factors, such as the influence of the metal source, the nature of the ligands, the substrates or temperature, affect these processes. Recent advances in computational chemistry have further enriched our understanding of this chemistry by elucidating the potential reaction mechanism and providing insight into the rate and enantio&#8208;determining steps in these catalytic transformations. However, challenges persist, and aspects such as ligand optimisation, full mechanistic understanding and scalability remain underexplored. Computational methods, however, present a remarkable potential to surmount these enduring challenges.

         <title>Pincer Ligand Facilitated Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer ligands exhibit features of stability and control of activity and selectivity during catalysis. They participate in multicomponent reactions by either coordinating with single metals or integrating into metal nanoclusters, triggering the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds with high efficiency.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions hold a significant position in the field of organic synthetic chemistry as they can rapidly construct structurally diverse molecules with high atom economy. Pincer ligands possess unique structural and electronic properties, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity in multicomponent reactions. This review systematically elaborates on the research progress of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands, thoroughly discussing their mechanism of action in different reaction systems, including crucial aspects such as substrate activation modes, the formation and transformation of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, an in&#8208;depth analysis of the relationship between the structures of various pincer ligands and their reaction performance is carried out, and multiple representative reaction examples are presented, such as multicomponent transformation processes of carbon&#8208;carbon bond and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond formation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8208;pincer complexes or metal&#8208;pincer nanoclusters. Furthermore, the future development of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands are prospected. It is anticipated that they will play a more crucial role in the development of novel organic synthetic methodologies, drug synthesis, and materials science, providing valuable references and inspiration for researchers in related fields.

         <title>Catalytic Reactions of Alkynyl Sulfides: Versatile Tools in Synthetic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a review of recent advances on catalytic transformations of alkynyl sulfides since 2004. Four different types of reaction modes, including the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization, electrophilic addition, radical&#8208;initiated functionalization, and formal [2+n] cycloaddition, are presented, with an emphasis on analysis of reaction mechanisms and key facts for controlling the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Alkynyl sulfides, a significant class of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkynes, have garnered considerable attention within the synthetic community because of their distinctive characteristics, such as the enhanced reactivity, precise selectivity control, and facile derivatization via C&#8722;S bond couplings. Their transformations can provide a direct access to functionalized organosulfur and even sulfur&#8208;free compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, which is very attractive for many fields, including organic synthesis, material science, medicinal chemistry, and life science. This review summarizes the recent progresses on catalytic reactions of alkynyl sulfides, such as the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed controllable functionalizations, including hydro&#8208;, hetero&#8208;, and carbofunctionalizations, electrophilic additions, radical addition&#8208;initiated functionalizations, and formal [2+n] cycloadditions, in which the reaction mechanism, selectivity control, scope and limitations are discussed in detail. Given the rapidly increasing interests and applications of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in both chemistry and life science, it can be anticipated that this review will be valuable for synthetic chemists and may contribute further development of the alkynyl sulfide chemistry.

         <title>Photochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article covers the recent development achieved in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multicomponent synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds and six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindoles.







Abstract
Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini&#8208;review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.

&lt;p&gt;This review article covers the recent development achieved in the visible-light-induced multicomponent synthesis of six-membered heterocyclic compounds and six-membered heterocycle containing spirooxindoles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini-review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six-membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six-membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible-light-induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Strategies for the Synthesis of Functionalized Cis&#8208;Hydrindanes in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cis&#8208;hydrindanes have attracted significant interest in the scientific community due to their prevalence in natural products and relevance in medicinal chemistry. This review discusses various synthetic strategies developed since 2000 for constructing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes, with a focus on their application in natural product synthesis and highlighting their importance in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The cis&#8208;hydrindane motif is a bicyclic structure commonly found in many natural products that exhibit significant biological activity. This structural feature is present in a variety of bioactive compounds, particularly terpenoids, steroids, and alkaloids, which are known for their therapeutic potential, including anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Due to its prevalence and biological relevance, the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework has attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists, who have devoted substantial effort toward developing efficient and diverse methods for constructing this important motif. Many of the synthesized cis&#8208;hydrindane compounds have been used as key intermediates or building blocks in the total synthesis of complex natural products. This review provides an overview of strategic approaches for synthesizing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes and its derivatives from 2000 to the present day, focusing on their application in natural product synthesis. By examining the diverse methods and their impact on natural product synthesis, this review will underscore the enduring importance of the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework in both synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit significant potential for applications in electroluminescence, owing to their distinctive electronic structures and varied chemical properties. Phosphorus heterocycles serve multifunctional roles within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including as emitters, host matrices, and electron and hole blocking layers, contributing to enhanced device performance. Their intrinsic structural characteristics confer key advantages, including superior thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and suitable energy level alignment, all of which are essential for optimizing electroluminescent efficiency. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclics materials and discuss their structure property relationships, which would provide insights into expanding the applicability of OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of the Transfer Rate&#160;of Porphyrins from Polysaccharides to Lipid Membranes in the Preparation of Lipid Membranes Incorporating&#160;Porphyrins by the Host&#8208;Exchange Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing straightforward and efficient methods for incorporating functional hydrophobic guest molecules into lipid membranes is essential for the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems. In a previous study, we reported the preparation of lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated C60, C60 derivatives, and C70 (LMICx) through a host&#8208;exchange method, wherein these molecules were transferred from &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin to liposomes. In this study, we applied a similar host&#8208;exchange approach to prepare lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated porphyrins (LMIPors), transferring porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes. However, until now, there has been no means to determine the transfer rates. To determine the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes, we developed a method involving the collapse of LMIPors via complex formation between lipids and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin. We believe that this method is general and can be deployed to liposomes incorporating various guest molecules prepared as drug delivery systems on the host&#8208;exchange process.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh catalysts are the preferred catalyst type for the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate to the pharmaceutically interesting racemic &#946;&#8208;aldehyde. High regioselectivities of 88&#8211;93&#8201;% to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained with various phosphine ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. In contrast, adding triphenylphosphine as common phosphine ligand shifts the regioselectivity to the undesired &#945;&#8208;aldehyde.







Abstract
Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh catalyst sample named &#8220;[HRh(PPh3)4]&#8221; due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91&#8201;%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77&#8201;%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93&#8201;%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.

         <title>Synthesis of Rhamnose&#8208;Modified Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Saponins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide, in which the l&#8208;fucose residue is replaced by l&#8208;rhamnose. These triterpenoid saponins were designed as negative controls for dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing non&#8208;integrin (DC&#8208;SIGN)&#8208;targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins were synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions were performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provided excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane&#8208; and oleanane&#8208;type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ectocarpin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.

A total enantioselective synthesis of ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of ectocarpin A.

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of 1,7&#8208;Dienes Induced by &#945;&#8208;Oxyalkyl/Acyl Radicals to Access Functionalized Benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cascade cyclization strategy is presented that enables the efficient transformation of 1,7&#8208;dienes with readily available radical precursors, including alcohols, ethers, and aryl aldehydes, into structurally diverse benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives.

A metal&#8208;free cascade oxidative cyclization method has been developed for synthesizing functionalized benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,7&#8208;dienes using alcohols, ethers, or aryl aldehydes. The reaction generates &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl or acyl radicals by direct C(sp3)&#63743;H or C(sp2)&#63743;H cleavage, avoiding photocatalysts and transition metals. This approach offers a mild strategy for the synthesis of benzo[b]azepine derivatives with high atom economy and efficiency. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis, confirm a radical&#8208;mediated pathway involving cyclization and single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, an azine NNN&#8208;Pd(II) non&#8208;palindromic pincer complex was generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) was explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, we report the selective synthesis of C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles (CAIs). Remarkably, this catalyst enables bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) synthesis by tuning the reaction conditions from the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C&#8208;3 functionalization of indole involves a &#8220;Borrowing Hydrogen Process.&#8217;&#8217; The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Method for Decarboxylative Halogenation of Aryl Propynoic Acids with Potassium Halides under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative halogenation of aryl propynoic acids has been established to synthesize haloalkynes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This electrochemical decarboxylation and iodination or bromination of aryl propynoic acids feature simple reaction steps, inexpensive materials, good functional group tolerance, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions.

Herein, an electrochemical method for the decarboxylative halogenation of aryl propynoic acids under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. In an undivided cell, diverse aryl propynoic acids and KX are employed to synthesize a series of haloalkynes. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the possible involvement of a free&#8208;radical intermediate in the transformation.

This overview highlights their chemistry, focusing on their reactivity and applications in polymerizations, total syntheses, pharmaceuticals, and bio&#8208;based chemical conversions; promoting sustainable and green chemical processes.

As one of the twelve fundamental principles of green chemistry, the employed feedstocks in chemical processes received substantial attention over the past decades. These efforts can be attributed to Werpy's 2004 list of top&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass. Conventional fossil&#8208;based feedstocks are both depleting and environmentally damaging, leading to the transition towards renewable, bio&#8208;based platform chemicals. Terpenes and terpenoids are a group of bio&#8208;based compounds well known throughout the scientific community. Although their acquirement from natural feedstocks is well known, comprehensive overviews of their applications in synthetic&#160;chemistry remain limited. Herein, a full comprehensive overview of the reported chemistry with terpenes is provided, while specifically highlighting their reactivity. Fifteen of the most common and useful monoterpenes and terpenoids are discussed, followed by a list of the remaining known compounds belonging to this group. These fifteen compounds have been employed in a vast number of chemical transformations with different applications including: polymerizations, total syntheses, chiral reagents/auxiliaries, pharmaceuticals, and chemical conversion to other useful bio&#8208;based chemicals. The presented chemistry in this work aims to provide chemists with a useful tool that should facilitate and stimulate the search for more sustainable, renewable, and environmentally friendly starting points for novel synthesis routes.

Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxo&#8208;Amination of Aryl Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Amino ketones were formed by rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxo&#8208;amination of aryl cyclopropanes with water and N&#8208;fluorobisbenzenesulfonamide (NFSI) under mild conditions. The good substrate scope of the reaction and radical&#8208;ionic mechanism&#8212;driven by single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and radical&#8208;polar crossover&#8212;reveal the versatility of rhodium(II) in oxo&#8208;amination chemistry.

A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed method is described for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from aryl cyclopropanes, utilizing water as an oxygen source and N&#8208;fluorobis(benzenesulfonamide) as a commercially available nitrogen source. This approach offers good substrate tolerance under mild conditions, providing a novel and practical route for &#946;&#8208;amino ketone synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal a sequential cascade pathway initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer facilitated by the rhodium(II) catalyst, followed by hydrogen atom transfer and radical polar crossover steps. These insights underscore the potential of rhodium(II) in driving radical amination reactions, enhancing the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from simple precursors.

         <title>Addressing Synthetic Complexity in Conjugated Polymers: New Synthetic Methods for the Acceptor Units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, 2,3&#8208;dihexylquinoxaline, and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In an attempt to address the growing problem of synthetic complexity in conjugated organic polymers, the synthesis of the common acceptor units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD), quinoxaline (Qx), and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) have been revisited, along with their dibromo derivatives necessary for use in catalytic cross&#8208;coupling. In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Reaction of Diiodoperfluoroalkanes with Aromatic Compounds: Divergent Synthesis of Two Product Types</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and organic&#8208;dye&#8208;catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines were attempted. In the reactions with 1,6&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacted to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gave a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide had reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yielded cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine had reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible&#8208;light reaction yielded products in which only one end had reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, we tried the reaction with various aromatic compounds and showed that it is effective for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings. We also discuss the mechanism of these reactions and point out the importance of the redox potential of the iodides.</dc:description>

Thioamides hold promise as bioisosteres for the commonly used amide pharmacophores. This paper presents a synthesis method for thioamides, achieved through the reaction of potassium acyltrifluoroborates with amines in the presence of elemental sulfur in aqueous solution. The process is simple, mild, and accommodates various polar functional groups, making it ideal for creating amide and thioamide drug libraries.

         <title>2&#8208;Formyl&#8208;5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furan (HMF) Derivatives as Active Complexing Agent for CO2 Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renewable&#8208;based furanics derived from 5&#8208;HMF are used to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) via CO2 insertion into epoxides. The BHTHF/NaBr complexing system shows high activity, achieving 94&#8211;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8211;99% COC selectivity under mild conditions. The system maintains catalytic efficiency over nine consecutive cycles without performance loss.

Renewable&#8208;based furan compounds derived from 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furan (5&#8208;HMF) are successfully employed as catalysts to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates through the reaction of carbon dioxide with epoxides. The effects of temperature, reaction time, reagent ratios, and carbon dioxide pressure are optimized before evaluating various bio&#8208;based complexing agents in combination with different alkali metal halide salts. Among them, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTHF) shows the highest efficiency as a complexing agent when paired with sodium bromide (NaBr), enabling the production of industrially relevant cyclic carbonates in high yields (12 examples, achieving 94&#8211;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8211;99% carbonate selectivity) under mild pressure conditions (carbon dioxide pressure of 1&#8211;10&#8201;bar, reaction time of 6&#8201;h, and temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the BHTHF/NaBr catalytic system demonstrates high stability, maintaining its performance over nine consecutive epoxide additions (8&#8201;mmol each) without any loss of efficiency.

The system maintains catalytic efficiency over nine consecutive cycles without performance loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable-based furan compounds derived from 2-formyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)furan (5-HMF) are successfully employed as catalysts to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates through the reaction of carbon dioxide with epoxides. The effects of temperature, reaction time, reagent ratios, and carbon dioxide pressure are optimized before evaluating various bio-based complexing agents in combination with different alkali metal halide salts. Among them, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTHF) shows the highest efficiency as a complexing agent when paired with sodium bromide (NaBr), enabling the production of industrially relevant cyclic carbonates in high yields (12 examples, achieving 94&#8211;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8211;99% carbonate selectivity) under mild pressure conditions (carbon dioxide pressure of 1&#8211;10&#8201;bar, reaction time of 6&#8201;h, and temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the BHTHF/NaBr catalytic system demonstrates high stability, maintaining its performance over nine consecutive epoxide additions (8&#8201;mmol each) without any loss of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propargyl radical is one of the important intermediates in organic synthesis due to its rich and diverse reactivity. In this review, the reactions involving propargyl radicals in recent years are summarized according to the means of producing propargyl radicals, reaction types, and asymmetric catalytic transformations.

Propargyl radical is a very important free radical in organic synthesis. The tautomerization with the allenyl radical enables the diverse reactivities, and then, propargyl compounds and allenes can be obtained. Because of its properties, how to control the chemical selectivity and enantioselectivity is the key in the radical propargyl functionalization. In this review, the reactions involving propargyl radicals in recent years are summarized according to the means for the production of propargyl radicals, different reaction types, and asymmetric catalytic transformations.

         <title>Tagitinin C, a Sesquiterpene Lactone, and Derivatives as Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tagitinin C, a germacranolide, isolated from Tithonia diversifolia was shown to have an interesting level of activity on the proteasome pathway. It is however a particularly unstable molecule, sensitive to acids, bases, nucleophiles, and light. This article describes a series of modifications aimed at improving the chemical and biological properties of the molecule and securing a solid industrial property. This study particularly focuses on the isobutyrate chain replacement by other esters or ethers. The key steps were the cross&#8208;conjugated dienone reactivity neutralization by reduction and the methylene lactone protection with morpholine or imidazole. Selective saponification of the isobutyrate was also achieved with crude pig liver esterase leading to tagitinol C with a moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constituted alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C. Some esters were more potent than the lead compound, whereas the di&#8208;ethers displayed higher activity levels, probably due to a better in vivo stability.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclization of Cyclohexadienone&#8208;Tethered Ynals to Stereodivergent 6,5&#8208;Bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;Tricyclic Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst enables the transformation of prochiral cyclohexadienone&#8208;tethered ynals into stereodivergent 6,5&#8208;bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;tricyclic products. A proposed kinetic resolution process probably enhances the enantioselectivity in the formation of bicyclic products.

Transforming a prochiral substrate into two stereodivergent products using a single chiral catalyst remains a significant challenge. Herein, an NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of cyclohexadienone&#8208;tethered ynals, enabling the preparation of two stereodivergent products: 6,5&#8208;bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;tricyclic frameworks, is reported. The reaction proceeds through two distinct pathways: an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/esterification sequence and an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/intramolecular Dieckmann condensation process. This approach represents a novel and efficient strategy for transforming a prochiral substrate into two products in a stereodivergent manner.

A complementary route to the synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolones is developed, which involves a CsF&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;4] tandem annulations under continuous&#8208;flow.

         <title>Improved Total Synthesis of Millepachine through a Negishi Acylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the acylative Negishi cross&#8208;coupling between 4&#8208;methoxycinnamoyl chloride and the suitable chromenic organozinc halide allows to develop a new protocol for the total synthesis of Millepachine, which gives the target product in improved overall yield, starting from 3&#8208;methoxyphenol.

The chalcone Millepachine exhibits interesting biological properties, such as cytotoxic and antitumor activity against various cancer cells. Despite these characteristics, the only published synthesis gives the product in modest yield. Herein, a study on the acylative Negishi cross&#8208;coupling for obtaining Millepachine in higher yield is presented. Both iodo&#8208; and bromo&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene derivatives, as precursors of the organozinc halides, are synthesized and different routes for obtaining the organometallic species are explored. The transmetalation from the aryllithium proves to be the most efficient method to obtain a reactive organozinc species for the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;methoxycynnamoyl chloride. Up to 75% yield of pure product is obtained corresponding to 43% overall yield from commercially available 3&#8208;methoxyphenol.

         <title>New Glycoconjugates Containing Selenium and Polyphenols. Stereoselective Synthesis by Pummerer&#8208;like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last 20 years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a&#160;Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work.&#160;The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available&#160;d&#8208;mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A DFT theoretical study was carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1. All compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazo Compounds Under Visible Light: Stereoselective Synthesis of Cyclic Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of diazo compounds under photochemical conditions find high selectivity. In the presence of light, diazo substrates can act as carbene precursors or radical sources depending upon the reaction conditions and catalysts used. This review focuses on recent advances (2020&#8211;2024) in stereoselective synthesis of various cyclic scaffolds via visible&#8208;light irradiation of diazo compounds.

Diazo compounds are versatile and valuable reagents in organic synthesis. The reaction of diazo substrates under photochemical conditions find high selectivity compared to that under thermal conditions. In the presence of light, they can act as carbene precursors or radical sources depending upon the reaction conditions and catalysts used. Recent years have witnessed a great advancement in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemistry of diazo compounds for asymmetric access to various cyclic compounds. In this review, recent advances (2020&#8211;2024) in stereoselective synthesis of cyclic scaffolds via visible&#8208;light irradiation of diazo compounds are summarized. This review is organized according to the ring size of the synthesized compounds, viz., three, four, five, six, seven, and higher&#8208; membered ring systems. With an emphasis of mechanistic insights and scope of the reactions, this review shades light on current trends in this emerging field.

         <dc:description>An efficient catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free amination reaction has been developed for the synthesis of various bio&#8208;inspired 6&#8208;substituted amino purine nucleoside analogues in good yields. In this sustainable approach, unprotected 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogues were synthesized via amination reactions of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine nucleosides with various&#160;amine derivatives. Notably, this method offers a simple, eco&#8208;friendly, unifying protocol for the synthesis of various bioinspired molecules with highly functional group tolerance. Additionally, to demonstrate its synthetic applicability, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction protocol has been shown for the synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;attached hybrid nucleoside containing various drug core moieties via click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bis(Phosphine) Monoxides and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphine Oxides through Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov Reactions of Phosphinite Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dihaloalkanes with methyl dialkylphosphinite esters provides a modular approach to bis(phosphine) monoxide ligands with different substituents on the two phosphorus centers. The intermediate haloalkylphosphine oxide reacts with N&#8208;arylimidazoles to give phosphine oxide&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand precursors.

A modular synthesis of bis(phosphine) monoxide (BPMO) ligands has been realized using the Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dialkylphosphinite esters. The modular synthetic method allows the chemoselective synthesis of BPMO ligands in which the substituents on the two phosphorus centers are different. This methodology also provides a route to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine oxide ligand precursors.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes from C60 and Propargylic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, open&#8208;cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open&#8208;cage fullerenes remains limited. In this study, it was discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps was initiated, resulting in the one&#8208;step synthesis of the corresponding open&#8208;cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology was confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes, and is expected to promote the widespread application of open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#63743;H Carbene Insertion</title>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H carbene insertion leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 82% isolated yield and excellent enantioselectivities up to 98% enantiomeric excess without any indication of a competing Buchner reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by a new ruthenium complex containing a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand in combination with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular carbenoid insertion into a C(sp3)&#63743;H bond leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium complex featuring a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand, combined with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand. This complex belongs to a recently introduced new class of ruthenium catalysts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 12393). Starting from N&#8208;benzyl &#945;&#8208;diazoacetamides, chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams are provided in up to 82% isolated yield with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, without any occurrence of a Buchner side reaction. Mechanistic experiments reveal that &#946;&#8208;lactam (4&#8208;membered ring) formation is inherently favored over the more common &#947;&#8208;lactam (5&#8208;membered ring) formation.

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the spiro&#8208;oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) afforded an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential "natural product in&#8208;waiting". Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported spiro&#8208;oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are "natural products in&#8208;waiting". Certain cytotoxic and anti&#8208;microbial properties of key compounds are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed/Mediated C&#8722;SCF3 Bond Formation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethylthiolated group (SCF3) is characterized by its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, excellent lipophilicity, good stability, and bioavailability, making it highly relevant for applications in drug design and development. This review summarizes recent advances in C&#8722;X (H, Cl, OTf, B(OH)2) trifluoromethylthiolation reaction from 2014 to 2024. The discussion is organized into three major sections: 1) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation reactions facilitated by directing groups (DGs), 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation via cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and 3) light&#8208;assisted transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Additionally, this review examines the substrate scope, limitations, and partial mechanisms associated with these transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven E&#8208;selective semihydrogenation scheme of alkyne compounds is developed for designing and synthesizing glioblastoma multiforme inhibitors. The representative reaction mechanism is decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments.

A visible light&#8208;driven E&#8208;selective semihydrogenation scheme of alkyne compounds is developed for designing and synthesizing glioblastoma multiforme inhibitors. Herein, room&#8208;temperature semihydrogenation reactions of various alkyne compounds are successfully achieved under the irradiation of white light. The representative reaction mechanism is decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments, revealing the critical roles played by [Ir(Cp&#8208;Me5)Cl2]2, PdCl2, DPPE and TEOA as photosensitizer, catalyst, ligand, and electron donor, respectively. This method exhibits excellent E&#8208;selectivity and broad functional group compatibility and demonstrates its practical value by producing pinosylvin and its derivatives with strong inhibitory effects on U87 cells.

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation and alkynylation reactions. Herein, we report the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones upon in situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8722;amino alcohol derivatives by post functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.) was showcased. The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance and potential application towards the synthesis chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Spiroannulation of N&#8208;Acyl Ketimines with Iodonium Ylides: Access to Spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;Ketals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed cascade [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] spiroannulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;ketals starting from 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;arylisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and iodonium ylides in &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; with high yields and excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable tool for the synthesis of bioactive molecules and complex natural products.

A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#63743;H activation/[3&#8201;+&#8201;3]spiroannulation of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;arylisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with iodonium ylides has been developed. The method facilitates the efficient and selective construction of spirocyclic compounds in a one&#8208;pot manner, offering high yields and excellent conversion. The reaction proceeds via a highly regioselective process, resulting in the formation of spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;ketals with remarkable chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a valuable protocol for the synthesis of complex spirocyclics with potential applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science.

The reaction exhibits a broad scope, good functional group tolerance, and good yields, and features ability of a gram&#8208;scaled synthesis. Results of mechanistic study reveal that the reaction initially undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form chromone 5, which can subsequently be reacted with 2a to yield C2&#8208;phosphorylated 2,3&#8208;2H&#8208;chromones through intermolecular addition.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphates is a recurring reaction in the core of microbial metabolism, a set of processes thought to date back to the origins of life. This study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation occurs in water without enzymes or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), enabled by diamidophosphate and nitrite.

The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis.

&lt;p&gt;The phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphates is a recurring reaction in the core of microbial metabolism, a set of processes thought to date back to the origins of life. This study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation occurs in water without enzymes or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), enabled by diamidophosphate and nitrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self-organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here, this study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen.

Divergent One&#8208;Pot Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Phosphoryl&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;Quinolones and 3&#8208;Indolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New methodology is being developed for the divergent synthesis of phosphonylated 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphonylated 3&#8208;indolinones based on phosphoryl&#8208;substituted ynones bearing (2&#8208;iodoaryl) group using controlled addition of anilines to them followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cyclization.

Herein, an approach is developed for the selective two&#8208;step synthesis of phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;indolinones. This is achieved through the reaction of (3&#8208;(2&#8208;iodoaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phosphonates with anilines followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of the intermediately formed regioisomeric enamines, which are selectively formed under neat conditions or in the presence of a gold complex as a catalyst. This method allows for the synthesis of a series of phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;indolinones in good yields.

         <title>Unlocking Indazole Synthesis from &#945;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ketoesters via Aryne Trapping: A Streamlined Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing demand to develop, beyond laboratory scale, more efficient, safer and ecofriendly, as well as scalable mechanochemical transformations, the direct synthesis of 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles via &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters aryne trapping is reported. The results reveal the unexpected formation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates, likely facilitated by a thia&#8208;fries rearrangement. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the various reaction products.

Indazoles are high&#8208;value chemical building blocks used in medicinal chemistry and materials science for their distinct structural and functional features. This study details a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between various aryl&#8208;ketodiazoesters and ortho&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates under mild conditions, leading predominantly to 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles. N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates are also observed as other products. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable synthetic approach. Mechanistic insights, derived from control experiments and density functional theory calculations, elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the products. Collectively, these findings underscore the method's potential for synthesizing complex indazole derivatives, which hold significant promises for applications in pharmaceutical development and advanced materials research.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) strategy has opened new avenues in organic synthesis. By leveraging the reductive generation of metal hydride species, particularly Co(III)&#8208;H, this approach facilitates the addition of hydrogen and various functional groups to alkenes under milder conditions. Crucially, it avoids the need for stoichiometric amounts of oxidants and hydride donors, allowing for a wide range of transformations.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.

         <title>Monomers with Spirocyclic Acetal Units for Synthesis of Sustainable and Recyclable Polymers with Improved Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress on the molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures, particularly bio&#8208;based ones, is highlighted and their use for preparation of high&#8208;Tg polymers is discussed. The impact of the spirocyclic acetal structures on the properties and possibilities for chemical recycling of the resulting polymers are briefly summarized

Multi&#8208;functional molecules with spirocyclic acetal structures are emerging as attractive monomers to prepare high&#8208;performance polymers designed to be depolymerized and recycled under specific physicochemical conditions. Spirocyclic acetal structures are formed by condensation of a suitable aldehyde or ketone with a polyol so that the functionalities necessary for the polymerization are retained. In general, rigid spirocyclic acetal units can efficiently enhance the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. This typically increases, for example, the stiffness and use&#8208;temperature of the materials. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of spirocyclic acetal units to acidic conditions may be utilized to develop polymers that may be conveniently and selectively cleaved into, for example, monomers or oligomers under controlled acidic conditions. This opens up opportunities for producing new chemically recyclable polymers and plastics. Herein, the recent progress in molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures and their use for the design and preparation of chemically recyclable high&#8208;Tg polymers is highlighted. Monomers and polymers with the potential to be derived from sustainable bio&#8208;based resources are given special attention.

         <title>Latent Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Two N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands: Synthesis and Catalytic Activity with Distinctive Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ruthenium complexes were synthesized and tested as latent olefin metathesis catalysts. Catalysts containing a diisopropylphenyl substituent on the NHC were thermally activated at relatively low temperatures compared to catalysts with mesitylene substituents. Complexes with mixed saturated/unsaturated NHCs excelled in high&#8208;temperature reactions with challenging substrates. UV&#8208;C light activation was successful with complexes with benzylidene ligands exclusively.

Novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [NHC]) ruthenium complexes of the form (NHC1)(NHC2)Ru(=CRR')Cl2 (where NHC represents N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and CRR&#8217; denotes Ph&#8208;indenylidene or benzylidene moieties) are prepared from second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation Grubbs catalysts. These complexes exhibit thermal latency in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), and several ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. Upon UV&#8208;C (255&#8201;nm) irradiation, two complexes that contained benzylidene ligands prove to be highly effective for the ROMP of cyclooctadiene. The most active species incorporate IPr or SIPr as at least one NHC ligand, highlighting how bulky isopropyl substituents enhance NHC lability. Beyond their utility in UV&#8208;C&#8208;initiated ROMP, these complexes show promising activity for high&#8208;temperature CM and RCM of alkenyl&#8208;nitrile substrates.

UV-C light activation was successful with complexes with benzylidene ligands exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene [NHC]) ruthenium complexes of the form (NHC&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)(NHC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)Ru(=CRR')Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where NHC represents &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene ligands and CRR&#8217; denotes Ph-indenylidene or benzylidene moieties) are prepared from second- and third-generation Grubbs catalysts. These complexes exhibit thermal latency in ring-closing metathesis (RCM), cross-metathesis (CM), and several ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. Upon UV-C (255&#8201;nm) irradiation, two complexes that contained benzylidene ligands prove to be highly effective for the ROMP of cyclooctadiene. The most active species incorporate IPr or SIPr as at least one NHC ligand, highlighting how bulky isopropyl substituents enhance NHC lability. Beyond their utility in UV-C-initiated ROMP, these complexes show promising activity for high-temperature CM and RCM of alkenyl-nitrile substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Cyanoxazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical protocol enables the rapid synthesis of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles from 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles and aliphatic amines in the presence of dipotassium phosphate. The method achieves high yields within minutes under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, offering improved sustainability for the construction of oxazole scaffolds.

A mechanochemical methodology for the preparation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles through the reaction of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with primary or secondary aliphatic amines (or their respective salts) in the presence of dipotassium phosphate is reported. The process is carried out by processing the mixture of starting materials in a mixer mill, with ethanol used as a liquid&#8208;assisted grinding additive. Dipotassium phosphate serves as a cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;toxic inorganic base, ensuring 100% carbon economy of the process. The reaction produces the corresponding oxazole products with up to 97% yield in just 10&#8201;min. However, preparative scope of the method is restricted to highly nucleophilic and sterically unobstructed primary and secondary aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines display low reactivity at room temperature. For instance, indoline achieves only 43% conversion to its oxazole product after 3&#8201;h.

         <title>Reactions of Halogermylenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of halogermylenes&#160;with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to form halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts is explored. Structural analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal their polarized covalent Ge&#63743;C bonds and dynamic NHC ligand exchange.

The reactions of the Rind&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (1a), and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (1b), with two types of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2 and Im&#8208;Me4) result in the formation of the halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts, (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(Eind)GeBr (2a') and (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(EMind)GeCl (2b'), and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(Eind)Ge]+[Br&#8722;] (3a) and [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(EMind)Ge]+[Cl&#8722;] (3b). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligands, whose structures are confirmed by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)&#160;calculations of 2a&#8217; and the cationic part of 3a, it is concluded that while the Ge&#63743;C(Eind) and Ge&#63743;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&#63743;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands.

     alt="Reactions of Halogermylenes with N-Heterocyclic Carbenes: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of halogermylenes&#160;with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to form halogermylene mono-NHC adducts and the germyliumylidene cation bis-NHC adducts is explored. Structural analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal their polarized covalent Ge&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bonds and dynamic NHC ligand exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions of the Rind-based 1,2-dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (&lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt;), and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (&lt;b&gt;1b&lt;/b&gt;), with two types of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im-&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Im-Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) result in the formation of the halogermylene mono-NHC adducts, (Im-&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(Eind)GeBr (&lt;b&gt;2a'&lt;/b&gt;) and (Im-&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(EMind)GeCl (&lt;b&gt;2b'&lt;/b&gt;), and the germyliumylidene cation bis-NHC adducts, [(Im-Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Eind)Ge]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3a&lt;/b&gt;) and [(Im-Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(EMind)Ge]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3b&lt;/b&gt;). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donating NHC ligands, whose structures are confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) analysis. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)&#160;calculations of &lt;b&gt;2a&#8217;&lt;/b&gt; and the cationic part of &lt;b&gt;3a&lt;/b&gt;, it is concluded that while the Ge&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C(Eind) and Ge&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis-NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands. The formation mechanism of &lt;b&gt;3a&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt; and two NHC molecules via (Im-Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Eind)GeBr (&lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt;) is discussed based on DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Dehydrogenative Coupling of Hydrosilanes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article examines the potential of Earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts in the dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes and alcohols, a key transformation for sustainable organosilicon synthesis and a promising method for hydrogen production. Recent advancements, mechanistic insights, and the implications of using them as viable alternatives to platinum group metals are discussed, including transition to greener and more cost&#8208;effective catalytic processes.

The dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols or water is a fundamental transformation in organosilicon chemistry, enabling the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes&#8212;key materials for coatings and adhesives. Traditionally, these reactions have relied on catalysts based on platinum group metals, which are costly and scarce. The development of Earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAM) catalysts offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative. This concept article highlights recent advancements in homogeneous EAM catalysis for these transformations, focusing on mechanistic insights, reactivity trends, and catalytic efficiencies. Catalysts based on manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, or zinc are reshaping the field by offering efficient and selective processes for the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes. Moreover, a key feature of these catalytic systems is their ability to generate dihydrogen as a byproduct, offering potential applications in hydrogen storage and utilization. Despite the good performances of EAM catalysts in the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of silanes, challenges remain, including improving turnover numbers, substrate scope, and catalyst stability. Future developments integrating computational and experimental approaches will be key to optimizing these systems.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three prenylated pterocarpans including erybraedin A and erybraedin C have been synthesised from (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin, itself prepared in four simple steps starting from resorcinol and 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenylacetic acid.

Chromium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Geminal Difluoroalkenes with Aliphatic Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides is catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2 combining with dtbpy ligand. It provides a viable strategy to stereoselectively form alkylated Z&#8208;fluoroalkenes, achieving the compatibility to a wide range of functionalities such as iodide, bromide, chloride, cyano, amino, and ester.

Herein, an effective, mild, and practical approach to stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides by cost&#8208;effective chromium catalysis is reported. This reaction is promoted by inexpensive CrCl2 combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri&#8208;substituted Z&#8208;fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility with a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to Z&#8208;alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of &#946;&#8208;fluoride atoms.

This reaction is promoted by inexpensive CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri-substituted &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility with a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of &#946;-fluoride atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Electricity in Dehydrogenative Coupling: Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Quinoline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing easy access to quinoline derivatives under room temperature, transition metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions using electricity as an oxidant through a dehydrogenative pathway. A wide range of functional groups are tolerated, giving the desired quinoline product in good yields.

An efficient strategy is demonstrated for the electrocatalytic synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl quinoline derivatives via an anodic dehydrogenation of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol molecules followed by condensation with carbonyl compounds at room temperature. The current protocol requires only electricity as the green oxidant, provides the desired products in good to excellent yield, and is compatible with a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Homocoupling of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system for the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes has been developed. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand, air as the oxidant, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications in the construction of symmetric 1,3&#8208;diyne derivatives.

The homocoupling of terminal alkynes is a key approach for constructing 1,3&#8208;diynes, typically relying on copper&#8208;based bimetallic systems. Herein, a catalytic system is developed based on nickel chloride, using 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand and air as the oxidant, which successfully enables the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Amphiphilic Fluoro&#8208;Functionalized Cellulosic Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Organic Dye Adsorption Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New amphiphilic fluoro&#8208;functionalized cellulosic materials are being yielded through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Covalent attachment of fluorinated moiety into biopolymers is being&#160;assured with full characterization. Fluoro&#8208;functionalized materials are being incorporated in alginate beads to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. Functionalization is leading to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency, the resulting functionalized&#8208;beads can be also easily recycled .

The growing interest toward biopolymers application in amphiphilic conditions prompts one to explore the preparation of fluorinated cellulosic materials. Cellulose (CE) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are functionalized with highly fluorinated pendants, through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on 3&#8208;pentadecafluoroheptyl&#8208;5&#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole (FOX) leading to the corresponding fluorinated biopolymers CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX. Structural and thermal stability confirm covalent attachment of the fluorinated moiety onto the cellulosic skeleton and highlighted an interesting 2D texture of the CMC&#8208;FOX material. Hybrid and amphiphilic features of CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX, are confirmed by water and oil contact angle measurements. Applications as adsorbent material for organic contaminants from an aqueous solution are tested by previously incorporating the functional biopolymer into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel beads. Rhodamine B (RhB) is used as a model wastewater pollutant. Fluoro&#8208;functionalization led to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency of the SA&#8208;incorporated biopolymer with respect to the corresponding non&#8208;fluorinated material (from 11% to 48% for SA/CE vs SA/CE&#8208;FOX beads and from 11% to 94% for SA/CMC vs SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads). Recyclability tests show good residual performance of SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads after seven desorption/reuse cycles opening the way to more sustainable adsorbing processes for the removal of emerging pollutants from contaminated water.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Difunctionalization of Carboranes with Benzoxazoles, Indoles, and Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the article, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed to incorporate benzoxazoles into m&#8208;carborane structures without preactivation using alkyllithium reagents. Subsequent regioselective iodination and the second cross couplings with various NH heterocycles and anilines yield the desired difunctionalized products. Challenging substrates such as heteroanilines and benzamide are also tolerated under the developed condition.

Icosahedral carboranes have a wide range of applications in medicinal chemistry, material science, and catalysis. Although various methods have been disclosed for functionalizing carborane structures, the methods to incorporate different types of heterocycles are still lacking. This limitation is likely due to the functional group incompatibility under previously reported reaction conditions. In this article, a streamlined protocol is presented to prepare a new class of vicinal difunctionalized carboranes containing benzoxazoles, NH heterocycles, and anilines. This method involves a direct cross&#8208;coupling between 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;m&#8208;carborane and benzoxazoles, thereby eliminating the necessity for preceding deprotonation of the acidic C2 proton present in benzoxazole. Subsequent regioselective iodination at the B(10) vertex of the carborane and the second cross&#8208;coupling reactions with diverse indoles and anilines result in the formation of the desired vicinal difunctionalized products.

Abstract
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxocyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthesize several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).

Herein, a novel DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene) mediates the synthesis of quinoxalines from o&#8208;phenylenediamines and sulfoxonium ylides. The method requires no metal catalysts and oxidizers, is economical and environmentally friendly, and has superior functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies have shown that DBU proceeds by inducing reactions through nucleophilic attack on sulfoxonium ylides. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and various cross&#8208;reactions further demonstrate the merits of this strategy.







Abstract
A novel method for the synthesis of quinoxalines from o&#8208;phenylenediamines and sulfoxonium ylides, mediated by DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene), is presented. This method does not require metal catalysts or oxidants, making it economical and environmentally friendly, while exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies suggest that DBU facilitates the reaction through nucleophilic attack on sulfoxonium ylides. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and various cross&#8208;reactions further highlight the advantages of this strategy.

         <title>Synthesis of C2&#8208;Silylated Indoles and Indolines Enabled by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Indolines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of indolines and hydrosilanes is presented to access C2&#8208;silylated indoles. Additionally, a rare example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed direct C2&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of indolines has also been established.

An efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot protocol is reported for the synthesis of C2&#8208;silylated indoles from indolines and hydrosilanes. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the transformation proceeds through a tandem dehydrogenation/C&#8211;H silylation pathway. Furthermore, an example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed direct C2&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of indolines is also disclosed.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4+1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4+1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8208;Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#8208;N bonds and the direct construction of indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles, but also enriches the research contents of formal (4+1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences.
