         <title>Photoinduced DNA cleavage using bioinspired photostable flavin analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the photosensitization capability of the naturally occurring flavin derivatives, viz. riboflavin (RF),flavin mononucleotide&#160;(FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and their photodegradation susceptibility due to the presence of ribityl/phosphate group; the current manuscript investigates the N10&#8208;modified flavin analogues for their reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capability and DNA cleavage activity, when irradiated with blue light. The effectiveness of superoxide anion generating property of photoexcited flavin analogs were determined using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and gallic acid quenching experiments. Among the flavin analogues studied, the simple propylflavin (PFl) was found to be most photostable and efficient in the conditions studied. The carboxyl&#8208;flavin (10Flc) displays behavior like that of FMN while the flavin&#8208;aspartic acid conjugate (FA) was found to show properties in between the&#160;PF&#160;and the&#160;10Flc.</dc:description>

Abstract
We herein developed a mild and ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman alcohols (MBHAs) and aryl triazenes. After thorough screening of the acids, nitric acid (HNO3) was unexpectedly found to be the most effective promoter for in&#8197;situ generation of arenediazonium salts. This coupling reaction allows for a highly selective production of a various &#945;&#8208;arylmethyl &#946;&#8208;keto esters from readily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Modern Approaches for Asymmetric Construction of CF3&#8208;All Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters from Prochiral Trifluoromethyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the research of organofluorine chemistry is a leading and rapidly emerging area of life sciences. Organofluorine molecules have drawn much attention by displaying a wide variety of applications in agrochemicals, medicines, fire extinguishers, and blowing agents. In the present review, the great advances made in the last decade for the asymmetric construction of quaternary stereocenters bearing trifluoromethyl group from the corresponding prochiral&#8208;trifluoromethylated substrates are discussed. A variety of catalytic frameworks have been designed in this field for asymmetric induction. The main prochiral&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates chosen for this review are &#946;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted nitro alkenes and &#945;, &#946;&#8208; unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones. Moreover, this review describes the further utilization of obtained CF3&#8208;quaternary centres to access the important organofluorine molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;C Coupling of Ketones with Ethanol and Methanol Enabled by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have reported the application of C1 and C2 alcohols for the C&#8208;C coupling with ketones enabled by nickel. De&#8208;hydrogenation of ethanol took place under relatively milder conditions (100 oC) and resulted the functionalized 1,5&#8208;diketones with acetophenone derivatives in one pot operation. Further, multi&#8208;component strategy using ketones, and methanol in combination with various nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles resulted the &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation under nickel&#8208;catalysis. For a synthetic application, a series of tetra&#8208;substituted pyridines have been demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, control experiments and deuterium labelling studies were established the interrupted borrowing hydrogen (I&#8208;BH) strategy. The catalytic transformations are highly sustainable and released water and dihydrogen as by products.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;promoted tandem synthesis of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridine and its derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we proposed a simple approach for synthesizing 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridine through, which was a tandem reaction and promoted by base. 2'&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and LiN(SiMe3)2 were simply added and combined to obtain different structures of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenanthridines (25 examples, &#8804;90% yield). In the syntheses of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenaridine, the transition metal&#8208;free approach outlined in this paper is direct, convenient and easy to execute.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Thiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Cascade Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We established an efficient asymmetric cascade pathway for the construction of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. This reaction proceeds via a Michael addition followed by an oxa&#8208;substitution, employing in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylide and ortho&#8208;hydroxy chalcone derivatives in the presence of a chiral thiourea catalyst at ambient temperature. This method accomplishes good to excellent yields and adequate stereoselectivity, with up to 84% ee and &gt;20:1 diastereomeric ratio.

This reaction proceeds via a Michael addition followed by an oxa-substitution, employing in-situ generated pyridinium ylide and ortho-hydroxy chalcone derivatives in the presence of a chiral thiourea catalyst at ambient temperature. This method accomplishes good to excellent yields and adequate stereoselectivity, with up to 84% ee and &amp;gt;20:1 diastereomeric ratio. A key advantage of this cascade [4+1] annulation approach is its ability to construct chiral DHBs under mild conditions with notable yields and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot rapid microwave assisted method has been developed for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of biomass derived levoglucosenone (LGO) analogues. This method uses the acidic resin Amberlyst 15 as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in ethanol solution. A small library of C4&#8208;substituted LGO analogues have been synthesised and oxidised using this method giving high yields in short times in each case. The purity of the recovered products was very high removing the need for chromatographic separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Iodoimidazole Nucleosides: A Biocatalyzed Whole Cell Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleoside analogues are biologically active drugs that are well known for their therapeutic properties. Chemical synthesis of these compounds is complex due to time constraints, contaminant methodologies, and numerous steps involved. In contrast, biocatalyzed synthesis, particularly using microorganisms, offers many advantages. In this work, we introduce the synthesis of 4&#8208;iodoimidazole&#8208;ribonucleoside, through a microbial transglycosylation biocatalyzed by Erwinia amylovora whole cells, selected as the optimal catalyst for this biotransformation upon evaluating our microbial collection. Parameters were analyzed to optimize the reaction, and the use of this biocatalyst in transglycosylation with other natural and non&#8208;natural bases and different sugar donor nucleosides was also verified.</dc:description>

         <title>Guaiacylglycerol as an Intermediate in Vanillin Production during Oxidative Conversion of Guaiacyl Lignin under Alkaline Conditions.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerizing lignin into hydroxybenzaldehydes like vanillin via oxidative degradation is a promising approach for lignin valorization. Alkaline nitrobenzene (AN) oxidation is a highly selective method for oxidative lignin conversion and serves as a benchmark in lignin chemistry, yet its reaction mechanisms are not fully understood. Previously, we proposed a pathway converting a phenolic &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound, erythro&#8208;guaiacylglycerol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;guaiacyl ether (GG), into vanillin through enol ether intermediates, E/Z&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyphenoxy)&#8208;ethenyl]&#8208;phenol EE. This study extends that work by exploring alternative AN oxidation pathways of GG that bypass EE. Through experiments assessing the impact of OH&#8722; concentration and studying deuterium incorporation at the &#945;&#8208;position of vanillin produced from both GG and isolated EE in NaOD/D2O, we identified guaiacylglycerol (GGL) as a new intermediate in a distinct pathway. GGL forms via &#946;&#8208;ether cleavage of a dianion arising from dual deprotonation of GG's phenolic and &#945;&#8208;OH groups, a process favored under high OH&#8722; concentrations conducive to dianion formation. Subsequent oxidation of GGL yields vanillin, with significant exchange of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen with solvent molecules. This study elucidates the complex mechanisms of AN oxidation and introduces novel intermediates and pathways, enhancing strategies for efficient lignin conversion into valuable chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Selective ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Aromatic Amidines with D&#8322;O</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O is demonstrated, achieving high regioselectivity and excellent yields. The use of Mn(CO)5Br as the catalyst and NaOAc as an additive facilitates efficient deuterium incorporation across a diverse range of substrates. The reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and the resulting products can be further transformed into deuterated heterocyclic compounds such as triazoles and imidazoles.







Abstract
We report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O as the deuterium source. The reaction, catalyzed by Mn(CO)5Br in the presence of NaOAc as an additive, proceeds with high regioselectivity, achieving efficient deuterium incorporation at the ortho&#8208;position with excellent yields. The reaction scope was extended to a wide range of substituted aromatic amidines, demonstrating consistently high levels of deuterium incorporation and broad substrate compatibility. Furthermore, the method was successfully scaled up to gram&#8208;scale, and the resulting deuterated products were subsequently transformed into heterocycles, including triazoles and imidazoles.

Abstract
Two facile and diversified protocols for the chem&#8208;selective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;fused coumarins and pyridocoumarins have been developed. Readily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions and good functional group tolerance make these procedures attractive for the construction of various dihydropyridine&#8208;fused coumarins and pyridocoumarins, which may enrich and develop the heterocyclic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Indole&#8208;Fused Chromane&#8208;Based Spirooxindoles via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective [5+1] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective [5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenols with isatins was established by the catalysis of Br&#248;nsted acid. Through this strategy, indole&#8208;fused chromane&#8208;based spirooxindoles bearing a quaternary carbon center were synthesized in moderate to good yields (53% to 99%) with excellent regioselectivities. Mechanism study demonstrated the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between the N&#8208;H group of the substrates and the acid catalyst. Moreover, an indolylmethanol&#8208;type intermediate was possibly generated after the first nucleophilic addition of indole C3&#8208;position to isatins during the reaction process. This transformation not only provided a good example for using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenols as 1,5&#8208;C/O&#8208;dinucleophiles in [5+1] annulations under acidic environment, but also achieved the first construction of indole&#8208;fused chromane&#8208;based spirooxindole frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Cardo Bisphenol Fluorene Fused with Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene for a High Refractive Index Monomer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of a new cardo&#8208;typed bis&#8208;phenol are described. A dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) core that has one ester group at the bay was prepared, and then intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation gave a key cyclopentanone intermediate. Finally, two&#8208;fold arylation successfully yielded a DBC&#8208;linked bis&#8208;phenol. This new DBC&#8208;linked bis&#8208;phenol was compared with the prototype bis&#8208;phenol fluorene (BPF). The structure&#8208;activity relationship between these two bis&#8208;phenols reveals that the expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using a skeletal DBC influences the quality of its attributes with a refractive index of 1.83. This comparative study provides us a basis for future cardo structure material chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition and Substitution Reactions with Grignard Reagents: Do We Know It All?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysis has been a cornerstone in organic synthesis, enabling a variety of highly efficient and selective C&#8211;C bond formation reactions, in particular enantioselective addition and substitution of Grignard reagents. Throughout time, we have gained significant understanding into how various factors, such as the influence of the metal source, the nature of the ligands, the substrates or temperature, affect these processes. Recent advances in computational chemistry have further enriched our understanding of this chemistry by elucidating the potential reaction mechanism and providing insight into the rate and enantio&#8208;determining steps in these catalytic transformations. However, challenges persist, and aspects such as ligand optimisation, full mechanistic understanding and scalability remain underexplored. Computational methods, however, present a remarkable potential to surmount these enduring challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Assisted Markovnikov Hydroximation of Styrenes Enabled by Photoredox/Cobalt Dual&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple photoredox/cobalt dual&#8208;catalytic approach has been reported for directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted Markovnikov hydroximation of styrenes under mild conditions, avoiding the use of strong acids, stoichiometric oxidants and reductants.







Abstract
By the combination of acridinium salt as a photocatalyst and cobaloxime complex as a co&#8208;catalyst, a simple and mild approach has been developed for the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroximation of styrenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, the directing&#8208;group on styrenes plays an important role for this transformation. Although the substrate scope seems to be limited, such an approach features excellent regioselectivity and high atom economy. In contrast with previous methodologies, this photoredox/cobalt dual&#8208;catalytic system is operationally simple, and avoids the use of any other sacrificial reagents.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Zeolite Catalyzed Dehydrative N&#8208;Benzylation of Amides for the Construction of Macrolactams Under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report continuous&#8208;flow dehydrative N&#8208;benzylation of amides using benzylic alcohols by reusable Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a heterogeneous catalyst. This method is scalable to grams and demonstrated for 30 amides and 15 macrolactams with water as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of acyclic amides and macrolactams has been demonstrated successfully via N&#8208;benzylation of amides using a highly reusable heterogeneous Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a catalyst, which gives only water as the byproduct. N&#8208;Benzylation of acyclic amides furnished 30&#8197;N&#8208;benzylated amides whereas intramolecular N&#8208;benzylation with alcohols was well tolerated with 15 examples of macrolactams bearing 11&#8208; to 15&#8208;membered rings. Notably, the scalability of this flow process has been demonstrated from milligrams to gram scale using the Ru&#8208;Zeolite heterogeneous catalyst. Moreover, the reusability of the catalyst is exemplified by the 16 reaction cycles carried out with one time&#8208;packed heterogeneous catalyst in the reactor bed.

         <title>Releasing Intramolecular Stress of Curved Fused&#8208;Core to Enhance N&#8208;Type Carrier Transport Performance in A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A Type Non&#8208;Fused Small Molecule</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a non&#8208;fused small molecular organic semiconductor, IMIC, with an A&#8722;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8722;A molecular type. Compared to fused A&#8208;DA'D&#8722;A counterpart, IMIC features a simpler synthesis process, improved solubility, and a broader light absorption range. The non&#8208;fused strategy alleviates intramolecular stress within fused ring molecules, significantly improving n&#8208;type semiconductor property.







Abstract
N&#8208;type organic semiconductors based on non&#8208;fused rings offer concise synthesis routes and low&#8211;cost production. Leveraging intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions, non&#8208;fused organic semiconductors can achieve fine regulation of molecular spatial configurations, thereby influencing the electrical performance. Herein, we successfully developed a non&#8208;fused n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an A&#8722;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, designated as IMIC. Compared to the fused A&#8208;DA'D&#8722;A molecule, IMIC not only simplifies the synthetic steps but also significantly improves solubility and optical absorption properties. The non&#8208;fused molecular architecture relieves the internal stress of rigid, curved polycyclic fused rings, granting greater spatial freedom to the components of the IMIC molecule, which is conducive to optimizing the spatial configuration of the molecule in the aggregated state. Ultimately, the electron mobility of OFET devices based on IMIC is tripled compared to TIIC, reaching 1.1&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in ambient conditions.

     alt="Releasing Intramolecular Stress of Curved Fused-Core to Enhance N-Type Carrier Transport Performance in A-D-A&#8217;-D-A Type Non-Fused Small Molecule"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a non-fused small molecular organic semiconductor, IMIC, with an A&#8722;D-A&#8242;-D&#8722;A molecular type. Compared to fused A-DA'D&#8722;A counterpart, IMIC features a simpler synthesis process, improved solubility, and a broader light absorption range. The non-fused strategy alleviates intramolecular stress within fused ring molecules, significantly improving n-type semiconductor property.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-type organic semiconductors based on non-fused rings offer concise synthesis routes and low&#8211;cost production. Leveraging intramolecular non-covalent interactions, non-fused organic semiconductors can achieve fine regulation of molecular spatial configurations, thereby influencing the electrical performance. Herein, we successfully developed a non-fused n-type organic semiconductor with an A&#8722;D-A&#8242;-D&#8722;A structure, designated as IMIC. Compared to the fused A-DA'D&#8722;A molecule, IMIC not only simplifies the synthetic steps but also significantly improves solubility and optical absorption properties. The non-fused molecular architecture relieves the internal stress of rigid, curved polycyclic fused rings, granting greater spatial freedom to the components of the IMIC molecule, which is conducive to optimizing the spatial configuration of the molecule in the aggregated state. Ultimately, the electron mobility of OFET devices based on IMIC is tripled compared to TIIC, reaching 1.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Diethylaluminium chloride is a known Lewis acid and can undergo 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;additions, whereas conjugate reductions are mostly observed as side reactions. By serendipity we found a Et2AlCl&#8208;promoted sequential cycloaddition / conjugate hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene and 4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylpropioloyl)oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one resulting in the clean formation of the corresponding norbornene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one.

Room temperature asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed arylation of N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridone with a range of sterically and electronically diverse arylboronic acids using the second generation C2&#8208;symmetric 4,8&#8208;tetrasubstituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;2,6&#8208;diene as a chiral ligand affords synthetically useful 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidones in 82&#8211;99&#8201;% yields and enantioselectivities up to 99.8:0.2 er.







Abstract
C2&#8208;symmetric 4,8&#8208;substituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;2,6&#8208;dienes are efficient bidentate steering ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridone. The arylation reactions proceed under mild conditions to provide corresponding 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidones in high yields along with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.8:0.2 er).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA), leveraging the reactivity of two distinct nucleophilic centers (oxygen and nitrogen), has emerged as a transformative strategy in organic synthesis for constructing carbon&#8208;hetero nuclear bonds in a single step. In this work, we report an innovative intermolecular DHMA cascade cyclization reaction catalyzed by a quinidine&#8208;based squaramide catalyst. The use of the squaramide catalyst is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances the electrophilicity of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, thereby promoting excellent enantioselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine. The process demonstrates excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99% ee), moderate diastereoselectivity (up to 6:1 dr), and high yields. The four different 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine stereoisomers have been synthesized with excellent enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, the scaleup reaction of the methodology has been extended with excellent outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Mono&#8208; and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Di&#8208;Halogenated Ketones Through Coupling of Halogenated Diboromethanes with Carboxylic Acid Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy has been developed for the controllable coupling of carboxylic acid esters with deprotonated halogenated diboromethane. A array of &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones were synthesized through using different halogenated diboromethane and electrophiles.







Abstract
Halogenated gem&#8208;diboron reagents, as structurally unique gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, are crucial in organic synthesis chemistry. Herein, we report a strategy with controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208; and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;di&#8208;halogenated ketones through nucleophilic addition reaction of halogenated diboromethanes with carboxylic acid esters. The substrate scope is broad and the nucleophilic addition reaction proceeds from a diverse range of carboxylic acid esters with bromo&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes. Moreover, an intriguing heterocyclic compound has been serendipitously synthesized as well.

         <title>Elemental Sulfur Promoted Cyclization of o&#8208;Chloronitrobenzenes and Aryl Isothiocyanates to Furnish 2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles from substituted nitroarenes is rare. Elemental sulfur has now been found to promote the cyclization of 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates to give 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles with different useful functionalities in moderate to good yields. The method provides a convenient pathway to obtain these compounds, as the nitroarene precursors could be directly used without further reduction.







Abstract
Methods to afford 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles often involve the use of o&#8208;aminothiophenols or aniline&#8208;typed precursors. Herein we describe a method to furnish 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles through the cyclization of o&#8208;chloronitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates with the assistance of elemental sulfur. From the perspective of step economy, our strategy allows for the direct use of nitroarene precursors without further reduction to anilines. The scope of the reaction with respect to both substrates was investigated, and it was found that electronic properties of the aryl isothiocyanate was important for obtaining acceptable yields.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime complexes catalyze highly diastereoselective radical cyclopropanation of olefins with &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates under mild conditions and low catalyst loading. A broad substrate scope including biologically active molecules is tolerated with high yields. This method is also amenable for gram&#8208;scale reactions, showcasing the application of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed metalloradical catalysis (MRC) in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established via nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines.







Abstract
An atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established by organocatalytic nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines, providing a straightforward way to achieve the expected C&#8722;N atropisomers in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) from readily available starting materials. Furthermore, axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole derivatives could be prepared upon oxidative aromatization of the corresponding N&#8208;arylindolines.

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.







Abstract
An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

A Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling of 1&#8208;arylbutadienes or styrenes with sulfonyl chlorides to give (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones, respectively has been developed. The dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones are prepared under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The developed method displays excellent regioselectivity, mild reaction conditions and compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
This work reports a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling technique for synthesizing (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from 1&#8208;arylbutadienes and styrenes, respectively. By employing easily available and inexpensive reagents, this method enables the synthesis of a diverse array of dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones with excellent functional group tolerance under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. It also proves versatile for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and the scale&#8208;up reactions. The method showcases notable selectivity, gentle reaction conditions, and compatibility with various functional groups as demonstrated through 66 examples with excellent display of regioselectivity.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annulated pyridines and substituted indoles are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. These heterocyclic motifs are easily accessible from secondary propargyl alcohols and hydrazine derived enamines by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions. The bifunctional ruthenium catalyst used is stable to air and moisture and is easily accessible in high yield from commercially available compounds.







Abstract
New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.

         <title>Ambient Pressure Hydroformylation &#8211; A Key Step to Meso&#8208;Alkyl BODIPYs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient four&#8208;step, five reaction sequence has been developed for the synthesis of meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs on the basis of ambient pressure hydroformylation. The use of a CO/H2 balloon mounted on a Schlenk tube as well as MTBE as the solvent allows for an easier to reproduce and environmentally benign synthetic method. The synthesis of 23 derivatives in up to 67&#8201;% overall yield shows the applicability of the developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs is presented. In our previous work, the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes was used to generate an aldehyde from an alkene via rhodium catalysis and use them in a subsequent tandem reaction to obtain BODIPY dyes. However, the use of higher pressures and therefore autoclaves as well as their necessary equipment might limit others to use this method. The refined approach in this work employs ambient pressure hydroformylation, done in a simple Schlenk tube and using a CO/H2 balloon, as key step towards an easier meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPY synthesis. Additionally, the use of MTBE instead of chloroform as reaction solvent results in a greener approach. Readily available and easily synthesizable alkenes as well as different pyrrole building blocks can be used to extend the range of known alkyl&#8208;BODIPYs. The synthesis of 23 derivatives with overall yields of up to 67&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the refined method.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small series of chromophores with an increasing number of norbornadiene units was synthesized. Comparison of the reversible photoisomerization reaction to the corresponding quadricyclanes revealed an optimal balance of photochemical properties for the tris&#8208;norbornadiene derivative.







Abstract
The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been established that multifunctional photoswitches with several norbornadiene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the corresponding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex=315&#8197;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex=520&#8197;nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lives of 1 to 2&#8197;days. Moreover, the photochemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.

         <title>Tunable and Selective Transformation of Aromatic Thioether Enabled by Regulating Active Species Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the effective regulation of active species, the controllable upgrading transformations of aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions have been achieved by a pyridinium photocatalyst, which are ROS&#8208;dominated aerobic oxidation and the chlorine radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, revealing the great potential of pyridinium molecules in photocatalytic field.







Abstract
Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8901;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8722;S bond activation and cleavage.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Synthesis of Pyrazolo&#8208;Sulfonamide: Impact of Solvent on Nitro&#8208;Pyrazole Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.







Abstract
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent method for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. The reaction exhibits notable solvent effects in pyrazole's reactivity. The ionic liquid DBU&#8208;AcOH triggered the reactivity of 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;pyrazole, whereas the reaction in PEG proceeded selectively at the 3&#8208; &amp; 5&#8208;positions of pyrazole. Key applications of this method include the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamide, sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside.

Abstract
Herein, we report a metal and additive&#8208;free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N,3&#8208;diarylpropanamides via in&#8197;situ thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse a&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation&#8208;dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]Thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. This review summarizes the developments in the construction of benzo[b]thiophene skeletons from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles by electrophilic and radical cyclization reactions.







Abstract
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.

         <title>Advances in Combined Asymmetric Catalysis of Transition Metal/Phase Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in asymmetric metal/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst combined catalysis for rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;transfer catalysts (PTCs) are chemical agents that facilitate the transfer of molecules or ions between different reaction phases, thereby accelerating heterogeneous reaction processes. Transition metal catalysts are renowned for their versatility in breaking inert chemical bonds and forming new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Over the past two decades, integrating metal catalysts with phase&#8208;transfer catalysts has emerged as a highly valuable and adaptable strategy in modern organic synthesis. This combined catalytic approach highlights the enhanced synthetic capabilities and demonstrates the benefits of merging these two catalytic systems. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in asymmetric catalysis that utilize the synergy between metal and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, focusing on their role in the rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.

         <title>O&#8722;Doped Carbon Nitride: A Recyclable, Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst for Oxidative Amidation of Aromatic Aldehydes and Amines under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride material was reported as an efficient solid photocatalyst for the synthesis of amide via the reaction of aromatic aldehydes with amines under visible light irradiation in the absence of metal, oxidant, or additives, and excellent functional group tolerance and good yields were observed. Additionally, this catalyst can also effectively activate the &#945;&#8208;position C&#8722;H bond of tetrahydrofuran and cumene.







Abstract
Oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines is a promising strategy for the synthesis of valuable amides. However, conventional methods often use toxic oxidants and additives, resulting in the generation of chemical waste. In this study, we report the catalytic oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines using molecular oxygen under additive &amp; metal&#8208;free conditions in visible light, facilitated by an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride (OCN) catalyst. The OCN catalyst shows excellent activity in the production of various amides, demonstrating high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the OCN catalyst can be reused several times without loss of activity.

         <title>Ring Opening and C(&#969;)&#8208;S Coupling: Nickel&#8208;Mediated Transformation of Alicyclic Alkoxyhydroperoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ozonolysis of cycloalkanone semicarbazones in alcohol containing solution with the subsequent addition of nickel (II) dithiocarbamates or xanthates was found to result in &#969;&#8208;xanthyl or &#969;&#8208;dithiocarbamyl carboxylic acid esters. The reaction proceeds in several steps. The initial one is cycloalkanone semicarbazone ozonolysis in the presence of alcohol, which leads to alicyclic alkoxyhydroperoxide. The second step is an extraordinary interaction between the alkoxyhydroperoxide and nickel (II) dithiocarbamate or xanthate, which proceeds via alkoxy radical formation and its subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission, resulting in C&#8208;S coupling products. The developed method allows to obtain &#969;&#8208;xanthyl or &#969;&#8208;dithiocarbamyl esters in yields up to 52% relative to the initial cycloalkanone semicarbazone.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters Using Me3SiI</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Me3SiI&#160;promotes the depolymerization of some alkyl and aromatic polyesters&#160;in the absence of catalyst. The monomer products&#160;and/or their value&#8208;added derivatives are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent choice , temperature and the amount of Me3SiI. The depolymerization of PES gives succinic anhydride. With PLA the ester CH3CH2CO2SiMe3 and propionyl iodide (CH3CH2COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. The decomposition of aromatic polymers PET and PBT affords the bis(trimethylsilyl) terephthalate compound (1,4&#8208;{CO2SiMe3}2C6H4). With PET, the formation of the latter species is hampered by the released I2. The initial addition of an iodine trap (1&#8208;pentyne) avoids these side reactions. The length of the carbon skeleton linking the carboxylic acid units influences the ease of the reaction and the nature of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Multicomponent Synthesis of Spirooxindole Dihydropyridine Bisphosphonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, simple, catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free microwave&#8208;assisted multicomponent method was developed for the synthesis of spirooxindole dihydropyridine bisphosphonates as a new family of compounds by the one&#8208;pot reaction of isatins, &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and primary amines. A proposed mechanism for the reaction was also provided along with DFT calculations, and the iminophosphonate as a key intermediate was also isolated and characterized.







Abstract
A new, simple, catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted multicomponent method was elaborated for the synthesis of spirooxindole dihydropyridine bisphosphonates as a new family of compounds by the one&#8208;pot reaction of isatins, &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and primary amines. The synthesis was carefully optimized in respect of the molar ratio of the starting materials, the heating mode, the temperature, the reaction time and the effect of different catalysts. The substrate scope of the synthesis was also investigated, and the novel title compounds could be prepared in moderate to good yields. A proposed mechanism for the multicomponent reaction was also provided, in which the iminophosphonate compound could mean a key intermediate through the formation of the desired spiro derivatives.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Sialic Acid&#8208;Derived Tracer for 18F&#8208;PET Multiple Sclerosis Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults, and efforts to understand disease progression continue to be intensively pursued. This is essential in order to reconcile the societal impact of this condition with the conspicuous absence of effective treatment regimes. Whilst magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field, enabling MS to be visualized in patients, distinguishing between other diseases that cause myelin sheath damage is a persistent challenge. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) holds great promise in differentiating neurological diseases, due to highly specific radiopharmaceuticals. To contribute to the growing interest in developing selective MS imaging agents, an 18F&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;based PET&#8208;tracer candidate with high affinity towards myelin&#8208;associated glycoprotein (MAG) is disclosed. Since numerous demyelination patterns are characterized by preferential MAG loss, this target scaffold is attractive in identifying lesion formation. A multi&#8208;step synthesis of the tracer is disclosed, together with preliminary validation of the radio&#8208;labeling process. In vitro experiments revealed promising properties that will inform future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration of Allylic Esters via an Organocatalyzed Claisen&#8208;type Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct transforming molecular skeleton to the other useful one is highly desirable for synthetic chemists. Oxygen atom migration of allylic esters is a powerful avenue for skeleton editing, and various methodologies involving palladium, Lewis acid and cobalt hydride catalysts have been reported. However, these protocols commonly suffer from inferior functional group tolerance and limited preparative application due to the harsh conditions and metal residues. Herein, we report a practical approach the transformation catalyzed by an organocatalyst 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). We test this protocol generality and practicality with uniform gram&#8208;scale reactions, and it tolerates with a broad range of functional groups including boric ester, nitrile, ester and others (42 examples). Moreover, corresponding products exhibit versatile reactivity with a series of nucleophiles to open up a platform for bioactive molecules synthesis. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed to rationalize the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced, Decarboxylative Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids with Diselenides to Form Selenoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides under metal and sensitizer&#8208;free conditions is reported.







Abstract
A mild and green strategy for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives has been developed through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides. This transformation proceeds smoothly without requiring any external photocatalyst, additive, or oxidant. Both diaryl and dialkyl diselenides react efficiently with &#945;&#8208;keto acids to produce selenoesters in good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the generated acyl radical is responsible for this transformation.

         <title>Determination of the pKaH of Established Isothiourea Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isothioureas (ITUs) represent a powerful family of (chiral) Lewis base organocatalysts. Interestingly, the Br&#248;nsted basicity of these frequently used compounds has so far not systematically been investigated. Thus, we have now determined the pKaH values of the most privileged (chiral) ITUs in acetonitrile (ACN) and DMSO by using NMR. Employing Wallace&#8217;s chemical shift imaging NMR method, the herein investigated ITUs were found to be weak Br&#248;nsted bases with pKaH values in the range of 16.8 &#8211; 17.9 in ACN and 6.3 &#8211; 7.8 in DMSO.</dc:description>

         <title>NaI&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Dihydroquinolines via an Unusual Azetine Intermediate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaI&#8208;promoted Skraup&#8208;type reaction of anilines with ketones via an unprecedented azetine intermediate has been developed, which was successfully applied to a hundred&#8208;gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines in good isolated yields.







Abstract
New approaches to improve Skraup&#8208;type reactions for large&#8208;scale synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines (1,2&#8208;DHQs) are highly desirable yet challenging in synthetic chemistry. Herein, an efficient sodium iodide&#8208;promoted Skraup&#8208;type reaction of anilines with ketones has been developed at low loading of HBF4 (0.5 mol%), thus providing a sustainable and economical strategy for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;DHQs. A variety of 1,2&#8208;DHQs were obtained in moderate to good isolated yields. The practicality of this strategy was well demonstrated by a hundred&#8208;gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline in 68% isolated yield. Intriguingly, an unusual azetine intermediate was successfully isolated and structurally determined by NMR and MS, indicating of an unprecedented mechanism for Skraup&#8208;type quinoline synthesis.

         <title>Quinoid Carbene Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in bioactive molecules, drugs, and materials. Diazo quinones, with unique reactivity, offer a promising route for forming these bonds. This review outlines recent progress using quinoid carbenes from diazo quinones to build C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds via various catalytic transformations, providing milder alternatives for diverse compound synthesis.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Traditional methods for synthesizing these bonds often rely on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Ullmann reactions, which have limitations, including the requirement for elevated temperature and basic conditions. In recent years, diazo quinones have emerged as promising reagents for C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bond formation due to their unique structural and reactive properties, which include high electrophilicity and a tendency toward aromatization. This review highlights recent advances in the use of quinoid carbenes, derived from diazo quinones, for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds. Key methodologies discussed include rhodium&#8208;, iridium&#8208;, ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, heteroatom&#8208;H bond insertion reactions, migration reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. These methods offer mild, functional group&#8208;tolerant alternatives to traditional approaches, showcasing their utility in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules, medicinally relevant compounds, and materials.

         <title>Case Studies of Dimensionality in Chemical Data</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use kinetic data dimension analysis, which is grounded in chemical reaction network theory, to analyze reaction monitoring data and extract the number of linearly independent reactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach for mechanism elucidation on 4 case studies with experimental data from the literature by deriving new insights.







Abstract
The ambition to relate intrinsic features of chemical data to the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is not new, but has experienced only modest success. This may partly be attributed to a lack of theoretical groundwork connecting idealized theory to actual experimental data with added complexity. In particular: i)&#8197;many CRNs have species that cannot be directly observed experimentally; ii)&#8197;the apparent number of underlying reactions is a function of the resolution of the data; iii)&#8197;chemical phenomena can change the number of discernable independent processes of the data. In this work, we illustrate the application of the recently introduced concept of data dimension, which quantifies the linearly independent dimensions the system composition in a CRN can change. We perform case studies inspecting the dimensionality of chemical data characterizing CRNs, and outline how it can be used for mechanistic interpretation. In some instances, these extended considerations allow us to directly recover the CRN proposed in the literature without any fitting. This demonstrates that, with incomplete information, important clues about CRN structure can still be recovered. Additionally, our approach detects critical subtleties, preventing important candidate reactions from being discarded in mechanistic studies.

         <title>Selective synthesis of cyclic dithiocarbonates using bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as multifunctional catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic dithiocarbonates (1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione) were efficiently synthesized from epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. Three different catalysts (BBE&#8722;Me, BBE&#8722;H, BBE&#8208;NO2) were designed and synthesized, with BBE&#8722;Me showing 95&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity. The catalyst enabled selective, solvent&#8208;free reactions under mild conditions. Mechanistic insights revealed simultaneous activation of CS2 and epoxides, acting as a multifunctional organocatalyst.







Abstract
Cyclic dithiocarbonates of the type 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione were selectively and efficiently produced from the reaction between epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. We have designed and synthesized this group of three nucleophilic catalysts from the neutral forms of bis&#8208;benzimidazole compounds (BBE&#8208;Me, BBE&#8208;H and BBE&#8208;NO2), through simple and efficient procedures. All three catalysts, with aryl substituents possessing different electronic characteristics, were able to selectively catalyze the production of cyclic dithiocarbonates. BBE&#8208;Me proved to be the most effective catalyst in the initial screening with 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenoxypropane, converting 95&#8201;% of the epoxide with 99&#8201;% of selectivity for the cyclic dithiocarbonate 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione. This catalyst was subsequently used to evaluate various reaction parameters and then several epoxides were selectively converted to the respective cyclic dithiocarbonates, under mild conditions, with a low catalyst loading, short reaction times, and in a solvent&#8208; and additive&#8208;free system. A mechanistic proposal, supported by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, demonstrated for the first time that a nucleophilic catalyst in this system can simultaneously activate both CS2 and the epoxide molecule.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 2&#8208;((Hetera)Cyclo) Alkylchromanols and their Spirocyclic Analogs through Enzymatic Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic Resolution An expedient approach to the multigram preparation of enantioenriched 2&#8208;((hetera)cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on their enzymatic acylation or enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates is described. Utility of the obtained intermediates for the preparation of chiral sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks valuable to drug discovery is demonstrated.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 2&#8208;((hetera) cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on enzymatic resolution is described. It is shown that enzymatic acylation could be used for the preparation of enantioenriched title compounds with primary alkyl substituents at the C&#8208;2 position. Meanwhile, enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates was optimal for the preparation of the target alcohols when significant steric hindrance is present, e.&#8201;g., due to the &#945;&#8208;branching. The latter factor was demonstrated to be crucial for the enzymatic reaction rate in both cases. The synthetic utility of the obtained chiral alcohols was demonstrated through Mitsunobu configuration inversion, as well as by preparation of the corresponding primary amines &#8211; valuable sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances in Allylic Fluoride Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic fluorides are among the most versatile fluorinated building blocks and are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical structures. They can be categorized into two structural types: allylic monofluorides (R=H, C) and allylic gem&#8208;difluorides (R=F). This review highlights recent progress in the synthesis of allylic fluorides by metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and non&#8208;catalytic methodologies.







Abstract
The recent decades have witnessed considerable progress in the development of fluorinated&#8208;building&#8208;block strategies and direct&#8208;fluorination techniques selectively affording allylic monofluorides and gem&#8208;difluorides. For allylic monofluorides, high enantioselectivities were achieved, even for fluorinated tertiary carbons, with expanded substitution patterns on vinylic moieties enabling precise structural control over di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted fluorides. Advances in defluorofunctionalization and direct C&#8722;H fluorination have addressed the limitations of raw materials and made these species more accessible. Additionally, considerable progress has been achieved in the related photoredox reactions, and electrochemistry has emerged as a valuable tool for allylic fluoride synthesis. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthesis of allylic fluorides, focusing on transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and noncatalytic methodologies.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids has been applied to develop enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, complex domino/tandem reactions, and miscellaneous cyclizations, allowing novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities. This review updates the field of enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations applied to the synthesis of chiral heterocycles, covering the literature since 2018.







Abstract
This review collects the recent developments in the synthesis of chiral heterocycles through enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations published since 2018. It demonstrates the power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids to provide an impressive diversity of reaction pathways, such as 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, various types of cyclizations, along with a wide variety of more complex domino/tandem reactions, allowing many types of novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Diastereoselective Entry to Novel Aminoindolizidines with Fused Furan, Thiophene, and Pyrrole Ring Starting from L&#8208;Glutamic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel aminoindolizidines fused to (tetrahydro)furan, thiophene or pyrrole nuclei were synthesized using a concise and diastereoselective approach from optically pure tricyclic heteroaryl&#8208;indolizidinols as key substrates. The synthesis involved Jurjew&#8208;type skeletal rearrangement, Staudinger reduction, Thompson azidation and Ra&#8722;Ni mediated diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. Overall, aminoindolizidines were synthesized in 6&#8211;8 steps from L&#8208;glutamic acid and heteroaryl carbaldehyde.







Abstract
A series of novel optically pure aminoindolizidines featuring fused tetrahydro&#8208;furan, thiophene, or pyrrole ring were synthesized from the proteinogenic L&#8208;glutamic acid as a chiral precursor and a nitrogen atom source. The synthetic sequence employed tricyclic indolizidinols as advanced building blocks, which were prepared on a gram&#8208;scale from bioavailable reagents. Key transformations within the used synthetic sequence included diastereoselective Thompson azidation, Staudinger reduction, Jurjew reaction, and highly diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. These steps facilitated the efficient and stereoselective synthesis of the ultimate amino&#8208; and N&#8208;acetylamino&#8208;indolizidines.

&lt;p&gt;A series of novel aminoindolizidines fused to (tetrahydro)furan, thiophene or pyrrole nuclei were synthesized using a concise and diastereoselective approach from optically pure tricyclic heteroaryl-indolizidinols as key substrates. The synthesis involved Jurjew-type skeletal rearrangement, Staudinger reduction, Thompson azidation and Ra&#8722;Ni mediated diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. Overall, aminoindolizidines were synthesized in 6&#8211;8 steps from L-glutamic acid and heteroaryl carbaldehyde.

         <title>Elucidating Fluorine Steering Effects in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions Interfaced with Charge&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational and experimental study of the effects of fluorinated dienophiles in Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions is disclosed, along with insights into the origin of reaction rate deceleration and the factors controlling endo&#8208; vs. exo&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the design and synthesis of a Br&#248;nsted acid activated fluorinated dienophile facilitating charge&#8208;enhanced Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported.







Abstract
Fluorinated molecules are core to contemporary drug discovery programs and critical for advancing innovation in numerous fields. In merging these important chemical themes, fluorinated Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition products are a particularly attractive subset of compounds with significant utility. Herein, an in&#8208;depth computational and experimental study of fluorine substitution effects on dienophile partners in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is reported. Of particular focus to this study is understanding the origin of reaction rate deceleration as a consequence of employing fluorinated dienophiles and the factors controlling endo&#8208; vs. exo&#8208;selectivity. To unlock insight into this unique reactivity, density function theory calculations, distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain models, energy decomposition analysis and natural bond orbital analysis, among other computational methods, were applied. In addition, the influence of oriented external&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;effects (OEEFs) and local electric field effects were explored. To further probe this effect, experimental studies of charge&#8208;enhanced Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity with fluorinated dienophiles were conducted. Collectively, this work offers novel mechanistic understanding pertinent to Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of fluorinated dienophiles providing valuable fluorinated scaffolds.

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs2CO3&#8208;I2 Promoted Efficient Synthesis of Flavones and Flavanones: Total Synthesis of Narengenin and Apigenin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a green synergistic combination of I2, Cs2CO3, and H2O systematically utilised to produce varied flavones and flavanones in a one&#8208;pot manner that includes numerous bioactive compounds along with the natural products naringenin and apigenin.







Abstract
Flavonoids are an important class of naturally existing scaffolds known for their diverse biological activities and have been immensely synthesized using stoichiometric reagent amounts. Herein, we report a reliable, robust, one&#8208;pot, transition metal and additive&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of flavones and flavanones from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and substituted aldehydes. Our developed method utilizes Cs2CO3 as a base and iodine as an oxidant in H2O: DMSO (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvent system, which provides direct access to many flavones and flavanones in excellent yields under milder reaction conditions with simple yet easily available substrates. In application, naturally occurring compounds such as naringenin and apigenin have been successfully synthesized using developed protocol.

We explored the first application of the novel O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine reagent for the direct synthesis of secondary amides and nitriles from ketones and aldehydes via the Beckmann rearrangement. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that this reagent is more stable than similar alternatives.

Abstract
A novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating agent, O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine (PymONHBoc), has been designed and synthesized, from readily available 2&#8208;chloropyrimidine. This reagent demonstrates superior shelf stability and ease of handling compared to other hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents. Here, we present a metal&#8208;free method for the direct conversion of ketones and aldehydes into sec&#8208;amides and nitriles using PymONHBoc as the aminating agent. This method efficiently converts a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds into the corresponding amides and nitriles with good to excellent yields under ambient conditions. The use of PymONHBoc is advantageous, as it facilitates the in&#8197;situ generation of the activated oxime intermediate, concomitantly producing a non&#8208;interfering byproduct.

         <title>Greening the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofuran Selenides: I2/TBHP&#8208;Promoted Selenocyclization of 2&#8208;Allylphenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative and green method to produce 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans promoted by the I2/TBHP oxidant system was developed. The reactions occur in only one minute in the presence of different 2&#8208;allylphenols and diorganyl diselenides at room temperature using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% I2 and 0.30&#8197;mmol of TBHP in the absence of solvent to obtain fifteen compounds in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
In this work we describe the synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing dihydrobenzofurans through the selenocyclization reaction of 2&#8208;allylphenols. The reaction procedure uses only an I2/TBHP oxidant system at room temperature, enabling an efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. The products are formed immediately after the addition of the oxidant system in a mixture of 2&#8208;allylphenol and diorganyl diselenide, in the absence of solvent, at mild experimental conditions. Furthermore, control experiments were carried out, including 77Se NMR analyses to identify intermediates, which contributed to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism.

The reactions occur in only one minute in the presence of different 2-allylphenols and diorganyl diselenides at room temperature using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.30&#8197;mmol of TBHP in the absence of solvent to obtain fifteen compounds in yields up to 93&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we describe the synthesis of selenium-containing dihydrobenzofurans through the selenocyclization reaction of 2-allylphenols. The reaction procedure uses only an I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TBHP oxidant system at room temperature, enabling an efficient synthesis of 2-[(organoselanyl)methyl]-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans. The products are formed immediately after the addition of the oxidant system in a mixture of 2-allylphenol and diorganyl diselenide, in the absence of solvent, at mild experimental conditions. Furthermore, control experiments were carried out, including &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Se NMR analyses to identify intermediates, which contributed to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Investigation on the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;anti&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;Silylboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Directed Regioselective Cascade Reaction with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and highly regioselective synthesis of pyrazoles and their derivatives from the combination of two different diazo compounds to afford N&#8208;substituted using CF3CH2OTf as reaction medium was developed, without any catalysts.







Abstract
A tandem system comprising cyclization reaction of diazo compound and cross&#8208;coupling of the other one has been developed. This provides facile access to pyrazoles and there derivatives with high levels of regioselectivity in moderate to good yields. This process uniquely utilizes CF3CH2OTf both as a solvent and a catalyst under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the intricate sequence involved in the formation of pyrazoles and further selective cross&#8208;coupling with another diazo compound.

         <title>Multicomponent Modular Synthesis of Thioacetals by Using Dichloromethane as the C1 Synthon Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy for the modular synthesis of a series of thioacetals by using stable and abundant feedstock chemical DCM as a C1 source was developed. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.







Abstract
Thioacetals are an important category of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds and versatile building blocks. Therefore, there is growing demand for the development of practical and modular methods to access various thioacetals from inexpensive and readily available commodity chemicals. Herein, we describe a novel one&#8208;pot multicomponent protocol for thioacetals synthesis, especially benzylthio thioacetals synthesis, by employing feedstock chemical dichloromethane (DCM) as the C1 source under metal&#8208;free, mild and simple conditions. Furthermore, its synthetic utility is further demonstrated by the preparation of deuterated thioacetals, large&#8208;scale synthesis and broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the dual roles of DBU as both a proton scavenger and a nucleophilic catalyst. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.

This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalysed Transamidation of Boc&#8208;Protected Diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) for Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid catalyst drastically accelerated the transamidation of Boc&#8208;DKPs with amino acid esters. This reaction progressed rapidly, and various tripeptides bearing D&#8208;proline residues were synthesised within 30&#8197;min in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. Notably, this method also allowed the preparation of longer tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.







Abstract
A carboxylic acid&#8208;catalysed transamidation of Boc&#8208;protected diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) was developed in this study, which allowed access to various tripeptides featuring a D&#8208;proline residue in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields within 30&#8197;min. Subsequent coupling reactions between the Boc&#8208;DKPs and di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide esters were successfully performed, furnishing the corresponding tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.

A novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons has been developed, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1] or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] manner.Two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields and with excellent selectivity in this tandem annulations, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines.







Abstract
Aldehydes as one of the most widely building blocks, have been frequently utilized as privileged C1 electrophile units and exhibited versatile applications to construct carbon&#8208;heteroatom and carbon&#8208;carbon bond. We herein described a novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1]or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1]manner. The maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons (n = 3, 6, 7) were originally designed and developed by our group which were used as flexible bisnucleophiles. By this tandem annulations approach, two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields (74&#8211;91&#8201;%) and with excellent selectivity, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines (24 examples) and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines (22 examples). Significantly, formaldehyde, long&#8208;chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes can act as C1 electrophile units catalyzed by racemic BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoric acid catalyst in these transformations, which then selectively attacked the OH or NH group bearing in functionalized maleimides and underwent the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond in a short time under microwave irradiation conditions.

         <title>Recent Development of DNA&#8208;based Biohybrid Systems Driven by Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging the fields of photochemistry and DNA&#8208;based materials paved the way for unprecedented reactivities and applications. This review focuses on recent developments around the design of biohybrid DNA&#8208;based nanosystems driven by light with a particular emphasis on cross&#8208;linking and ligation reactions, programmable photo&#8208;release and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries.







Abstract
Photochemistry has provided a powerful alternative to generate reactive intermediates under mild reaction conditions and photobiocatalysis is currently widely applied in organic synthesis. While enzyme&#8208;based photocatalysis has attracted a lot of attention, light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems are also increasingly being applied to a large variety of applications from molecular imaging to enantioselective catalysis, and other fields such as DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). This review gives insights into these research fields by classifying the existing light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems developed to date.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.







Abstract
The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.

         <title>An Efficient Synthetic Methodology for the Preparation of Glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents an efficient methodology to prepare glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl glycosyl ethers. The synthetic route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions proceed with retention of the anomeric configuration. Additionally, the synthetic route afforded other useful compounds, such as glycosyl isoxazolines and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones, which can be employed in further synthetic and biological studies.







Abstract
In this study, we present a synthetic methodology for preparing glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl ethers. The process involves three steps: nitrile oxide cycloadditions, reduction of the glycosyl isoxazolines, and oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions were conducted with retention of the anomeric configuration. The resulting glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones were then utilized in the synthesis of the corresponding pyrazoles.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of naphthannulated S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;heteroaryl compounds from isomeric ethynylbiaryl starting materials using a PtCl2&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction is reported.







Abstract
Polycyclic heteroarenes that contain internal thiophene, furan and pyrrole rings are well&#8208;documented materials due to their presence in fossil fuels and their importance in organic optoelectronic applications. Accordingly, a variety of methods are available for their synthesis. In this report we prepared naphthannulated 4&#8208;membered heteroarene isomers through the PtCl2&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo cyclization of ethynylbiaryls. Isomers were accessible from two structurally different precursors that contained the ethynyl subunit in different positions. We synthesized two pairs of thiophene&#8208;based ethynylbiaryls where each pair would lead to the same tetracyclic isomer and explored their reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformation. The formation of a detectable amount of inseparable side&#8208;product was observed when the alkyne was introduced onto the benzene ring of the biaryls. This is suggested to be an exo&#8208;methylene group containing derivative that forms via a 5&#8208;exo cyclization pathway. Similarly, naphthannulated benzofuran isomers were prepared following the same strategy and an exo&#8208;methylene&#8208;containing side product was observed when the alkyne unit was on the benzene ring of the biaryl. Finally, novel synthesis methods were described for benzo&#8208;fused carbazoles from ethynylbiaryls containing an alkyne either on the heterocyclic ring or on the phenyl substituent attached to the indole ring. No side&#8208;product formation was detected in this case.

         <title>A Sequential Nitro&#8208;Michael Addition and Reductive Cyclization Cascade Reaction for Diastereoselective Synthesis of Multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and pot economic synthetic strategy has been established for the diastereoselective construction of multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidonyl&#8208;spirooxindoles. DFT studies clarified the mechanism of regioselective cascade ring closure, highlighting the preferential reactivity of reduced nitro groups with nitriles, while ester groups remained unreactive.







Abstract
In this investigation, we elucidated, one&#8208;pot two stage efficient synthesis of multifuctionalized spiro[oxindole &#8722;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine]. The methodology proceeds via organocatalyzed nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction between indolylidenecyanoesters and nitroalkanes to formed nitro&#8208;Michael adduct which transformed into multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles by metal catalyzed reductive cyclization cascade. DFT investigations were conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the preferential reduction of the nitro group, with subsequent attack on the nitrile and ester groups remain inert throughout the reaction process. The approach is operationally simple, easily scalable, exhibits compatibility with readily accessible starting material and catalysts, thereby emphasizing cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Recent Advances in Chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids/Peptides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances on the selective C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides using various chalcogenides has been demonstrated. As a result, the evolved methodologies, encompassing transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic protocols, exhibit superior efficiency compared to conventional chalcogenation methods.







Abstract
Natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids are building blocks of biomacromolecules proteins and peptides, which are essential for living organisms. Recently, structurally modified amino acids and their peptides have received high demand for the development of various types of biomaterials, including therapeutic drug candidates. For example, the chalcogenated amino acids and their peptides serve as privileged structural scaffolds, derived from native amino acids. Given the widespread utility of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds in biological, pharmaceutical, and medicinal chemistry, efficient chalcogenation protocol has been accomplished through various catalytic methods such as transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic strategies. Among them, transition&#8208;metal based strategies through C&#8722;H activation have been extensively explored for the chalcogenation of amino acids and peptides. Concurrently, metal&#8208;free and photocatalytic strategies offer sustainable and step&#8208;economically viable pathways for achieving successful chalcogenation. In this review, we have focused on the recent achievements of both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides with chalcogenides along with their substrate scopes, mechanisms, advantages, and limitations.

         <title>Substitution pattern of the secondary rim of ICyD ligand influences stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and evaluation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;capped cyclodextrin with various protecting groups were conducted. The corresponding gold complexes catalyzed the stereoselective cycloisomerization of enynes. Permethylation of the cyclodextrin&#8217;s hydroxyl groups improved yield and selectivity compared to its benzylated counterpart. Notably, alternating methyl and benzyl groups on the secondary rim of the cyclodextrin further enhanced asymmetry, achieving even higher enantioselectivities. To synthesize this compound, we optimized the selective deprotection of all benzyl groups at the 2&#8208;position of the sugar residues in the cyclodextrin.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Method for the Direct Sulfonylation of N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrochemical strategy for the synthesis of sulfonylphenol derivatives from N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with sulfonyl hydrazides has been successfully developed. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free protocol is suitable for aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic reagents to afford the corresponding sulfonylated products in moderate to high yields under mild conditions. Notably, we successfully scaled up the reaction to gram quantities, underscoring its potential for larger&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, the synthesized sulfonylphenol derivatives exhibited promising in&#8197;vitro antibacterial activity, highlighting their potential therapeutic relevance.

         <title>Reactions of Unsymmetric Chiral Dialdehydes with Lysine: Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Macrocyclization and Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes are discovered to undergo regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions with an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine, to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. Addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. These compounds are also found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.







Abstract
Three BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (S)&#8208;4, (S)&#8208;5, and (S)&#8208;6, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (S)&#8208;4 and (S)&#8208;5 are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.

     alt="Reactions of Unsymmetric Chiral Dialdehydes with Lysine: Regio- and Enantioselective Macrocyclization and Fluorescent Sensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BINOL-based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes are discovered to undergo regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions with an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine, to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. Addition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. These compounds are also found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three BINOL-based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Ritter&#8208;Type C&#8722;H Amination of Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type amination of alkylarenes with nitriles is reported, in which the alkylarene is first brominated by CBr3COOH under Ce(III) catalysis and blue light irradiation, and the resulting bromide then undergoes the normal Ritter reaction to afford the amide product.







Abstract
Reported here is a photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type C&#8722;H amination of alkylarenes with nitriles. Under the irradiation of blue light and the catalysis of a simple Ce(III) salt, alkylarenes were brominated by CBr3COOH and thereby channeled to the normal Ritter pathway to afford amide products. A wide range of alkylarenes and nitriles were tolerated, with a few equivalents of a nitrile being feasible.

         <title>Facile Access to Phospholene Fused Polycycles through Intramolecular Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of Phosphole Sulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile and straightforward pathway for construction of phosphorus containing polycyclic compounds through Alder&#8208;ene reaction of the 1,n&#8208;enyne moiety. This work also has demonstrated the advance and feasibility of the alkene cyclization strategy in the synthesis of structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds and naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons.







Abstract
We have developed a simple, metal&#8208;free annulation of phosphole sulfides through intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;enyne component. This atom&#8208;efficient cyclization pathway provides phospholene fused polycycles with high yields and excellent regioselectivity. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization of phosphole sulfides with a phenyl group affords structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds. Meanwhile, phosphole sulfides with a naphthyl group produce naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons, as well as structurally complex [2+2] cycloaddition products.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores methods to convert alkylboronic esters into alkyl amines, high value motifs found in bioactive molecules, materials, and catalysts. Three distinct reaction pathways are discussed: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangements, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.







Abstract
Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8722;B bond in a range of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Photoredox Catalyzed Synthesis of Indolyl &#916;2&#8208;Isoxazolines via a Formal C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrogenative photoredox catalyzed formal C(sp3)&#8208;H intramolecular cyclization of indolyl&#8208;oximes to generate indolyl &#916;2&#8208;isoxazolines is reported. In contrast to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the reaction avoids the use of super stoichiometric chemical oxidants and high reaction temperatures and is proposed to operate via two sequential single electron oxidation events.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkoxylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, producing only hydrogen as a by&#8208;product. This method efficiently functionalizes a wide range of alcohols, enabling the synthesis of celestolide and diphenhydramine derivatives.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical process for the direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds without the need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. This environmentally friendly and sustainable synthetic strategy facilitates the alkoxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H in benzylic groups. The approach enables the late&#8208;stage incorporation of complex alkoxy groups into bioactive molecules, providing potential applications in the synthesis of celestolide derivatives.

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane Dicarboxylate into 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) protocol is developed for converting dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) to 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). Methanol served as both the hydrogen donor and solvent, while a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst is employed. At 235&#8201;&#176;C, the process achieves 96.61&#8201;% conversion with 60.71&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient protocol for the conversion of dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) into 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) was proposed via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH). In this approach, methanol functioned as both the hydrogen donor and the solvent, and a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst was utilized for facilitating the reaction. Under the specified conditions at 235&#8201;&#176;C, a conversion of 96.61&#8201;% with a selectivity of 60.71&#8201;% was achieved. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, comprehensive characterizations were conducted to examine the catalysts with varying ZrO2 contents. The investigation revealed that the reaction begins with the adsorption of DMCD and methanol onto the acidic sites of the catalyst, followed by their activation on the reduced&#8208;state Cu.

         <title>Utilizing N&#8208;Hydroxylamine&#8208;Based Active Esters for the Synthesis of Oseltamivir Amide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;derived active esters were synthesized from oseltamivir, which can serve as practical synthetic handles to prepare oseltamivir analogs. Succinimide&#8208;based active ester was the most effective derivative for synthesizing a series of oseltamivir carboxamides.







Abstract
Functionalizing and derivatizing pharmaceuticals are essential for preparing new potentially active compounds. This work shows how active esters derived from oseltamivir carboxylate can be useful synthetic tools for accessing various amide derivatives of oseltamivir. Six hydroxylamine active esters were synthesized directly from oseltamivir carboxylate, and their utility in preparing amide derivatives was evaluated. Succinimide ester 5&#8201;e was the most efficient in terms of its preparation and in synthesizing oseltamivir derivatives.

         <title>Advances in C&#8722;N Bond Formation via N&#8208;Centered Radicals from N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread presence of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in natural products and chemical materials, along with their extensive applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, has inspired significant efforts to develop new synthetic methods for constructing C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, enabling various useful transformations under mild reaction conditions. In recent years, readily accessible N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and ylides have emerged as highly promising scaffolds for the generation of N&#8208;centered radicals under photocatalytic conditions. These pyridinium reagents can also serve as bifunctional substrates, providing a variety of useful pyridine&#8208;containing products. This review comprehensively addresses significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates, aiming to provide organic chemists with detailed insights to drive further expansion in this field.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, which facilitates many useful and challenging transformations, particularly in the formation of C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community. This review comprehensively includes all the significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates.

         <title>Chiral Sulfoxide Ligands in Asymmetric Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of the transition metals (Pd, Ru, Rh) in conjuction with chiral sulfoxide ligands applied in asymmetric allylic substitution from 2013 to 2024 has been documented. Based on this summary, a perspective into chiral sulfoxide ligands in the future is provided.







Abstract
Chiral nitrogen&#8208;, and phosphorus&#8208;based ligands have been extensively investigated in the asymmetric allylic reactions. However, chiral sulfoxides have not been deemed as a class of practical chiral ligands until last decade, despite several distinct advantages over traditional ligand scaffolds, such as the proximity of the chiral information to the metal center and the ability to switch between S and O coordination. This perspective collects the recent development of chiral sulfoxide ligands for asymmetric allylation since the beginning of 2013. In addition, insights into the future development of this type of promising ligand are discussed.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Linalool&#8208;Derived Compounds via Catalytic Epoxidation and Ring Opening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the selective epoxidation of linalool to produce linalool epoxide, a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of novel linalool&#8208;derived compounds. A robust and non&#8208;noble cobalt catalyst was employed to achieve high yields of linalool epoxide under mild reaction conditions. The catalytic system displayed remarkable efficiency and reusability, providing a platform for exploring different feedstock, including rosewood oil, to demonstrate its versatility in raw feedstock valorization. Further functionalization of linalool&#8208;derived molecules was achieved through regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions, yielding novel ethers with potential applications in the fine chemical industry. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive approach to the sustainable synthesis of linalool&#8208;derived compounds, displaying the versatility of the catalytic system and providing a basis for the development of novel fine organic compounds with potential industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Unexpected Ring&#8208;Contraction Rearrangement and Halogenated Addition Reaction to Synthesize 3&#8208;Substituted Phthalides and Isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;One Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Using a system mediated by iodine(III) and tetrabutylammonium halides, unexpected ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenation addition reaction of isocoumarins were achieved, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.







Abstract
Iodine(III)&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenated addition reaction have been realized. A series of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives bearing multiple functional groups were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies indicated that the reaction proceeds via a proton transfer followed by ring opening and ring formation to produce the target product. Moreover, preliminary biological evaluations revealed that both of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives show good antitumor activities.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the difunctionalization strategy of unsaturated bonds has served as a robust and elegant strategy for ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. Compared with previous research, the application of benzophenone reagents that generate two free radicals under visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer conditions can greatly streamline the reaction steps, improving the reaction efficiency and optimizing the reaction conditions. In this short review, the recent advance in developing the bifunctionalization of unsaturated bonds by diphenylmethanone oxime ester reagents is concisely described.







Abstract
The concurrent installation of C&#8722;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8722;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8722;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the advancements of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. We discuss the ongoing challenges of selectivity, particularly in remote (meta/para) C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization, and the reliance on directing groups. Insights from 2018 to 2024 are categorized by reaction type, revealing mechanistic developments that promise enhanced efficiency and broader applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8722;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted 7&#8208;Deazapurine Ribonucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted derivatives of 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides with different combinations of aryl and arylalkynyl substituents were synthesized through regioselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions and tested for biological activity.







Abstract
Several series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides were synthesized to investigate their biological activities. The key&#8208;intermediate chloronucleosides were prepared by an anion&#8208;base glycosylation with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloro&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine. The target compounds were obtained by diazotation, either Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions in the case of 2&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;hetaryl nucleosides or two consecutive Suzuki reactions in the case of 2,6&#8208;diaryl nucleosides. The sequence of diazotation and the first Suzuki reaction is flexible and can be changed depending on the target compounds. Some of the final nucleosides showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines and low antagonistic activity against a panel of adenosine receptors.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for synthesizing 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was established through sequential click cycloaddition and aminations mediated by triazolyl(Mes)iodonium salts. This method employs a copper&#8208;catalyzed process, characterized by mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and straightforward operational procedures. The method facilitates the efficient construction of substituted aminotriazoles through both stepwise and one&#8208;pot syntheses. The practical synthesis of triazolyliodonium salts as stable solids is expected to enable further derivatizations.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in&#8197;situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8722;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfones from Substituted Alkenes via Molybdooxaziridine Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the MoO2Dipic promoted sulfonation of alkenes using N&#8208;Ts&#8208;hydroxylamine as the quantitative source of Ts. The reaction works with high yields and stereoselectivities for styrenes with a wide variety of substitution patterns. A novel atom transfer radical addition mechanism involving the formation of molybdooxaziridine complex 1 as the active catalyst, difunctionalization with Ts&#8208;NO, followed by oxidation, and then elimination as the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step for the formation of vinylsulfone 3 has been proposed. Initial kinetic and mechanistic data indicates the formation of Ts&#8208;NO and provides evidence for the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosyl esters as stable donors in chemical glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient glycosylation methods are continuously being developed to obtain homogeneously pure carbohydrates to study their biological roles. The development of effective and stereoselective glycosylations using novel anomeric leaving groups constitutes an active area of research in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Although various glycosyl donors have been developed over the decades, anomeric esters as donors in glycosylation have received significant attention in recent times due to their convenience of preparation, shelf stability, catalytic activation, mild conditions, and high glycosylation efficiency. We focus in this mini&#8208;review on covering the glycosyl ester&#8208;containing donors utilized in chemical glycosylation methods, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters in glycoside synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Photoelectrochemical&#8208; Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Aldehydes to Acyl Radicals and Their Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from aldehydes to acyl radicals and their transformations are presented with mechanistic insights. This review focuses on recent advances, showcasing the potential and delivering different modes of reactivity of acyl radicals as well as future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactivity. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes to acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss the important advancements in the past 6&#8197;years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their applications in organic synthesis. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free iodine&#8208;dependent green protocol of chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin/4&#8208;phenylamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208; substituted&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed at room temperature and ambient air in green solvent PEG&#8208;400.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly approach for the C3&#8208;H regioselective chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed by using diphenyl dichalcogenides and iodine as support in green solvent PEG&#8208;400 under ambient temperature and aerobic condition. Furthermore, chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone has also been accomplished in similar conditions. The proposed mechanism is based on the control experiments and suggests an ionic pathway. The reaction offers a green synthetic path with a high yield, and the methodology is crucially significant due to its operational simplicity, convenient execution, scalability, and tolerance of various functional groups.

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Juncus acutus&#160;is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic acetates and chlorohydrosilanes using nickel catalysts has been reported to produce a series of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
This paper introduces an innovative strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes via nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The approach utilizes propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to produce a variety of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are notably mild, and the process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, as well as an impressive substrate scope. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the use of chlorogermane and chlorostannane, facilitating the synthesis of germanium or stannium&#8208;substituted allenes. This research not only offers a valuable strategy for the preparation of multisubstituted allenes but also significantly broadens the synthetic repertoire for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of carbazole porphyrins in mixture of chloroform and methanol. In chloroform, porphyrins assembled into micro&#8208;belt superstructures, however, 90&#8201;% MeOH in chloroform resulted chiral helical microfibres of 1 and twisted helical ribbons of 2, respectively. The chiral superstructures utilizing the fundamental self&#8208;assembly principle, in which one directional growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of core of porphyrin along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain.







Abstract
Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.&#8201;e. 90&#8201;% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.

The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Sustainable Total Synthesis and Chiral Pool Strategies with Emphasis on (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol in Natural Products Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. In fact, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a critical and comprehensive review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the synthesis of natural products through diverse synthetic routes employing (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt. Additionally, newly developed catalysts and synthetic protocols using (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol amongst their substrates scope are also analyzed and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
