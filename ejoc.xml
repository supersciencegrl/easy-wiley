         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed and Silver&#8208;Promoted Reactions of Isocyanides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver catalysis exhibits a remarkable capacity for the activation of isocyanides. In recent years, silver&#8208;catalyzed and silver&#8208;promoted organic reactions of isocyanides have attracted much attention. They offered straightforward and facile access to a wide range of highly useful linear or cyclic compounds. This Review offers a comprehensive coverage of the recent progress in this field.







Abstract
In recent years, the silver&#8208;catalyzed and silver&#8208;promoted isocyanide reactions have attracted much attention, due to its efficiency in the formation of diverse new bonds and good reaction selectivity. A series of highly useful linear or cyclic compounds have been constructed. In this review, the recent progress in this field is described in the sequence of synthesis of five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds, synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds, synthesis of fused cyclic compounds as well as synthesis of linear nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Spiropyrazoloaminonitriles with Arylidene Pyrazolone and Vinylogous Malononitriles through a Cascade Michael Addition and Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of title compounds were accomplished by a reaction of vinyl malononitriles and arylidene pyrazolones catalyzed by base. This protocol proceeds via Michael addition followed by intramolecular cyclization leading to the formation of two new C&#8722;C bonds. Further the same reaction was also conducted with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyano olefins and vinyl malononitriles to furnish 1,6&#8208;dihydro biphenyl compounds. Simple reaction conditions, high yields and compatibility are the advantages of this protocol.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Free Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Iodides in a Bioinspired Deep Eutectic Solvent with Mo(CO)6 as a Safe CO Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed amino&#8208; and alkoxycarbonylation of aryl iodides has been exploited, for the first time, in a bioinspired Deep Eutectic Solvent and in gas&#8208;free conditions, by using Mo(CO)6 as the CO source. The method allows the preparation of carboxylic amides and esters in high yields (up to 99%), short reaction time (2 h) and in mild reaction conditions (80 &#176;C), with a low catalyst loading (2.5 mol%). Noteworthy, in the case of N&#8208;hexylbenzamide, it has been demonstrated that both the catalyst and DES can be used for four consecutive runs, with a moderate decrease of catalytic efficiency. The methodology has been also applied to the preparation of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient used for the treatment of human scabies and lice.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroazulene&#8208;Boron Subphthalocyanine Conjugates with Oligo(phenyleneethynylene) Bridging Unit: Photoswitchable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroazulene &#8211; Boron subphthalocyanine (DHA&#8208;BsubPc) conjugates were prepared, and the influence of the BsubPc, without or with peripheral fluorine substituents, on the ability of the DHA to photoisomerize into a vinylheptafulvene (VHF) was studied and vice&#8208;versa the influence of the DHA and VHF on the BsubPc fluorescence (on/off).







Abstract
In this work, we have linked the dihydroazulene (DHA)/vinylheptafulvene (VHF) photo&#8208;/thermoswitch and the boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) fluorophore via an axial oligo(phenyleneethynylene) bridging unit into new DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates. The objectives were to elucidate the influence of BsubPc on the DHA/VHF switching reactions and the influence of DHA/VHF on the BsubPc fluorescence in these conjugates for which the entire axial substituent connected to boron comprises one large, conjugated scaffold. We present the synthesis and properties of DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates with varying peripheral substituents on the BsubPc core, being either unsubstituted (H12BsubPc) or partially fluorinated (F6BsubPc). Fluorination of the BsubPc core provided a remarkable increase in the reversibility of the DHA&#8208;VHF interconversions promoted by light and heat, respectively, and accompanied by on/off switching of the BsubPc fluorescence. Synthetically, the units were connected using Sonogashira coupling reactions of suitable acetylenic building blocks.

         <title>BF2&#8208;Chelates of N&#8208;Acylhydrazones as Versatile Coupling Partners in Photoredox Promoted Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoroboryl chelate complexes derived from hydrazones serve as good substrates in reactions with alkyl radicals generated under photoredox conditions.







Abstract
Five&#8208;membered difluoroboryl chelate complexes are competent substrates for radical reactions with various radical precursors including potassium trifluoroborates, bis(catecholato)siliconates, 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted Hantzsch esters, dihydroquinazolinones, esters of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide, Katritzky salts, alkyl iodides and thiols. Using these reagents, primary, secondary, and tertiary radicals can be generated under oxidative or reductive conditions and add at the C=N bond of the difluoroboryl chelates leading to hydrazide products.

&lt;p&gt;Five-membered difluoroboryl chelate complexes are competent substrates for radical reactions with various radical precursors including potassium trifluoroborates, bis(catecholato)siliconates, 4-alkyl-substituted Hantzsch esters, dihydroquinazolinones, esters of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide, Katritzky salts, alkyl iodides and thiols. Using these reagents, primary, secondary, and tertiary radicals can be generated under oxidative or reductive conditions and add at the C=N bond of the difluoroboryl chelates leading to hydrazide products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The construction of intriguing scaffolds through the recombination of natural products fragments are important both in organic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, a basicity&#8208;controlled synthesis of (dihydro)furo[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives through (3+2) cyclization between 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and &#946;&#8208;chlorinated nitrostyrenes was developed.







Abstract
The construction of novel skeletons through the recombination of natural products ring systems is attractive. Herein, a basicity&#8208;controlled synthesis of (dihydro)furo[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives through (3+2) cyclization between 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and &#946;&#8208;chlorinated nitrostyrenes was developed. In addition, preliminary study gave the chiral dihydrofuro[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;one derivatives with up to 83&#8201;%&#8201;ee.

         <title>Axial Chirality in Alkylidene&#8208;Cyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral alkylidenecycloalkanes and their related compounds are interesting molecules. Their axial chirality comes from the geometry of C=C double bond or the orientation of two substituents in the para position of cycloalkanes. This concept focuses on summarizing recent advances of axial chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules and arouse the research interests to this promising field.







Abstract
Axial chirality is an interesting stereoisomeric phenomenon in organic chemistry and a key structural feature of several organic compounds. Atropisomers such as biaryls, anilides and diaryl ethers are one type of axially chiral compounds, whose axial chirality is resulted from rotationally blocked single bond. Allenes, spiranes and alkylidenecycloalkanes are another type of axially chiral compounds and their axial chirality come from the perpendicular geometry of two pairs of substituents. The axial chirality in atropisomers, allenes and spiranes has been widely investigated and well developed, while the similar chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules gained very limited attentions. This concept focuses on summarizing recent advances of axial chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules and arouses the research interests to this promising field.

         <title>A Building Block Approach for the Total Synthesis of YM&#8208;385781</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A building block approach to the synthesis of YM&#8208; and FR&#8208;analogs has been developed and utilized for the synthesis of YM&#8208;385781. The structure of the final analog was confirmed both spectroscopically and through biological assays, and it was interesting to note that even the less potent synthetic analog made here was able to inhibit both oncogenic Gq signaling and uveal melanoma cell growth.







Abstract
YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are potent and selective inhibitors of the Gq/11&#8208;signaling pathway. As such, they have been attractive targets for both synthesis and biological studies. Yet in spite of this effort, a versatile synthetic approach to the molecules that allows for the rapid construction of a variety of non&#8208;natural and labelled analogs and an increase in the amount of those analogs available remains elusive. We report here a convergent building block approach to the molecules that can solve this challenge.

         <title>Tetrathiaporphyrine: A Novel Natural Product from Allium Subgenus Melanocrommyum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structure of a red pigment from Allium species, subgenus Melanocrommyum, has been successfully elucidated using X&#8208;ray crystallography. This revealed the compound to be a tetrathiaporphyrine, which has been synthesized in two steps starting from pyrrole.







Abstract
A novel purple&#8208;red pigment from the plant genus of Allium (onions, leeks), subgenus Melanocrommyum (drumstick onions), is described. Because of this pigment, which reminds of blood, some species of the subgenus Melanocrommyum are used in Southwest and Central Asia as herbal medications, as spices or as vegetables. A proposal for the formation of this structure is provided, which is the first example of a tetrathiaporphyrin in nature. The described substance shows low stability towards thermal stress, light and oxidant; additionally, its symmetric nature made structural elucidation a challenge. It could be shown that, contrary to previous reports, the structure of the red pigment is that of a tetrathiaporphyrin. Full structure elucidation was only possible by X&#8208;ray crystallography and total synthesis of the intended molecule. Further on, the newly discovered red pigment was used for the modification of nanoparticles and monitoring its polymerization events using SPR.

         <title>Cargo Encapsulation in Photochromic Supramolecular Hydrogels Depends on Specific Guest&#8208;Gelator Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels can reversibly dissipate to fluids. They can be used as light&#8208;triggered drug delivery systems. Here we analyze with advanced NMR techniques, which supramolecular interactions are meaningful for physical loading of such gels with cargo to create compositions with selective photorelease and minimized cargo leaking in the absence of light.







Abstract
Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are prospective materials for light&#8208;triggered drug release and bionanotechnology. Here we present a structural analysis of peptide&#8208;derived photochromic supramolecular hydrogels, which were physically loaded with a selection of biologically related compounds, using advanced techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance. The results enable detailed and correct understanding of the loading process and will allow for correct design of pharmacologically relevant systems for phototriggered drug delivery.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Chain&#8208;Deuterated Sphingosine and Its Derivatization to Produce Ceramide, Sphinganine and Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of sphingosines with different deuterated chains. The synthesis of highly stereoselective chain deuterated sphingosine was accomplished in five steps which started from hydrothermal platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange of protiated fatty acids. The subsequent synthesis of the deuterated&#8208;chain derivatives are also described. They were all characterized with deuterated content above 94&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sphingosine plays crucial roles in various cellular functions. Deuterated molecules are widely used as the important tools to explore the structure, property, and function of biochemical materials. We here report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of sphingosines with different deuterated chains. The synthesis started from different protiated fatty acids, which underwent hydrothermal platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange to produce the deuterated chains with different length. The Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons (HWE) coupling of a chiral amino acid derivative with the deuterated chains generated the unsaturated ketone precursors. The following stereoselective reduction via cyclic Felkin&#8211;Anh transition led to the desired anti&#8208;amino alcohol geometry. This efficient protocol enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated sphingosines. The subsequent synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated derivatives, i.&#8201;e. ceramide, sphinganine and sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, is also described. Their deuterium content was simultaneously characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum (HRMS).

         <title>Synthesis of Methylene Tetrahydrofurane&#8208;Fused Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via regioselective oxidation, keto&#8208;saccharides can be further derivatized. Here, we show that after allylation, iodocyclization, and elimination, several methylene tetrahydrofurane&#8208;fused glycosides can be obtained. Those glycosides can be further used as scaffolds or have handles for photoclick chemistry.







Abstract
A reliable method is disclosed to introduce a fused methylene tetrahydrofuran ring into carbohydrates. The resulting bicyclic saccharides can be used as scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and drug design. In addition, the enol ether functionality serves as a handle that enables modification in biological systems via photoclick chemistry. The approach is based on the regioselective oxidation of the C&#8208;3 hydroxy group in gluco&#8208;configured pyranosides, followed by stereoselective indium&#8208;mediated allylation. The ring formation is induced by an iodocyclization reaction with a neighboring hydroxy group. Subsequent dehydrohalogenation affords the desired methylene&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;containing carbohydrates.

         <title>Photoinduced Glycosylation Using a Diarylthiophene as an Organo Lewis Photoacid Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinuduced glycosylations of trichloroacetimidate donors and several alcohols using diarylthiophenes as organo Lewis photoacid catalysts proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding glycosides in good to high yields. In addition, the present glycosylation method was applied successfully to the total synthesis of a biologically active natural product, cholesteryl 6&#8208;O&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucoside.







Abstract
Here reports an photoinduced glycosylation of trichloroacetimidate donors and several alcohols using 3,11&#8208;dimethoxydinaphthothiophene as an organo Lewis photoacid catalyst upon long&#8208;wavelength UV&#8208;LED light (385&#8197;nm) irradiation. The reaction proceeded under mild reaction conditions smoothly to give the corresponding glycosides in good to high yields. In addition, the present glycosylation method was applicable to a wide range of trichloroacetimidate donors and acceptors. Furthermore, the dinaphthothiophene catalyst could be recovered and reused without any loss of efficiency. Moreover, this glycosylation method was applied successfully to the total synthesis of a biologically active natural product, cholesteryl 6&#8208;O&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucoside.

         <title>Thioether&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) can be used as electron&#8208;donators in electron&#8208;transfer systems. The variation of the substitution pattern allows for the adjustment of electronic properties of the HBC core. The synthetic routes toward a series of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs and the investigation of their electronic properties are described, as well as their reactions to the corresponding sulfones and sulfonium salts.







Abstract
The synthesis of novel mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexafluorinated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) and their conversion into their thioether&#8208;substituted analogs is reported. The substitution reaction with the corresponding thiolates was performed microwave&#8208;assisted to significantly reduce the reaction time. With increasing amount of fluorination or thioether&#8208;substituents, a decreasing extinction coefficient can be observed for the HBCs. Successive addition of thioether&#8208;moieties leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission bands, whereas the nature of the attached thioether does not affect the optoelectronical properties. To further tune the electronic environment of the HBC core, a successive oxidation to the corresponding sulfone as well as the formation of the sulfonium salts were performed. With that, the electron&#8208;donating thioethers were transformed into electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, resulting in an inversed electron demand in the periphery of the core. The so obtained compounds showed decreased extinction coefficients and a broadening of the absorption and emission bands.

         <title>Front Cover: Tetrathiaporphyrine: A Novel Natural Product from Allium Subgenus Melanocrommyum (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 20/2023)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a new class of bloody&#8208;red sulfur compounds, so called tetrathiaporphyrines, which could be isolated from some wild onions (genus Allium L.). These plants are known as drumstick onions and belong to the subgenus Melanocrommyum. This pigment is formed enzymatically if plant tissue is injured. Now, the colour&#8208;giving tetrathiaporphyrine, representing a new class of chemical pigments, could be fully synthesized, using 2&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as starting block. The final structure of the pigment was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of the reddish, flat crystals. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Keusgen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 20, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the evolution of experimental studies on electric field&#8208;induced chemical transformation over the past fifteen years. In particular, it explains how chemical processes involving the bond formation and bond cleavage can be triggered by a scanning tunneling microscope, an interfacial electric field, and a designed local electric field at both the nanoscale and bulk scale. These are unique and distinct techniques that can provide excellent and advanced methods in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Experiments showed that the existence of electric fields in non&#8208;redox processes may alter the catalytic activity, rate enhancement, and selection of organic reactions. It is expected that the interaction between electric fields and chemical reactions will create new avenues for producing materials with desired properties in several chemical disciplines, including synthetic organic chemistry, catalysis, nanotechnology, membrane technology, and enzyme catalysis. Specifically, in this review, we discuss the elegant experimental investigations carried out using the scanning tunneling microscope, the interfacial electric field, and designed local electric fields. The results of these studies are remarkable, leading to new information on the function of electric fields in controlling chemical reactivity and selectivity in different reactions and offering a glimpse of the great potential of electrostatic fields. This article not only presents the core concepts of field&#8208;induced chemical transformations but also illustrates the potential use of electric field catalysis in chemistry and other fields.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic and Fused Isoxazoline Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of fused and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;enriched isoxazoline building blocks via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of functionalized chloroximes and cyclic alkenes is disclosed. The target compounds are prepared on a multigram scale, and their potential for further functionalization is revealed.







Abstract
A highly efficient multigram synthesis of spirocyclic and fused isoxazoline building blocks is described. Isoxazoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates were synthesized via a regioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)acetate and carbo&#8208; or heterocyclic alkenes bearing endo&#8208; or exocyclic C=C double bonds, resulting in fused or spirocyclic isoxazolines, respectively. The preparation of up to 300&#8197;g of these compounds was achieved in a single run. The ester group of isoxazolines was then subjected to common synthetic transformations for the synthesis of corresponding building blocks, including alcohols, chlorides, azides, amines, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, amino acids and their derivatives, difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds, and bicyclic &#947;&#8208;lactones. Additionally, a direct cycloaddition&#8208;based approach to the synthesis of aminoalkyl&#8208; and chloromethyl&#8208;substituted isoxazolines was proposed to improve their preparation. The described isoxazoline building blocks are expected to be valuable tools for drug discovery.

         <title>Fluorinated Analogues to the Pentuloses of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated carbohydrates are valuable tools for enzymological studies due to their increased metabolic stability compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated analogues. Replacing different hydroxyl groups within the same monosaccharide by fluorine allows to influence a wide range of sugar&#8208;receptor interactions and enzymatic transformations. In the past, this principle was frequently used to study the metabolism of highly abundant carbohydrates, while the metabolic fate of rare sugars is still poorly studied. Rare sugars, however, are key intermediates of many metabolic routes, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here we present the design and purely chemical synthesis of a set of three deoxyfluorinated analogues of the rare sugars d&#8208;xylulose and d&#8208;ribulose: 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (1DFRu), 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (3DFRu) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose (3DFXu). Together with a designed set of potential late&#8208;stage radio&#8208;fluorination precursors, they have the potential to become useful tools for studies on the complex equilibria of the non&#8208;oxidative PPP.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Insertion of Sulfur Dioxide Mediated by Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Indolizines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, photocatalyst&#8208;free sulfonylation of indolizines are developed thanks to an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex approach. The formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds, without further pre&#8208;functionnalization, in metal&#8208;free and mild conditions renders this three&#8208;component approach sustainable and green. The newly 3&#8208;sulfonylated indolizines show promising photophysical properties with high fluorescence and large Stokes shifts.







Abstract
This work investigates a light&#8208;driven 3&#8208;component sulfonylation reaction of indolizines without needing any external photocatalyst. The mechanistic investigations support the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex in&#8197;situ. This transformation offers a mild and sustainable approach with high functional group tolerance for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfonylated indolizines. This compound class has valuable photophysical properties and represents promising candidates in various applications related to fluorescence.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Bridged Nitropyrazoles &#8211; Adjustment of Performance and Sensitivity Parameters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitropyrazoles are famous powerful energetic materials. Herein we revisited the concept of alkyl&#8208;bridged nitropyrazoles to gain insight into structure&#8208;property relationships. The exchange of explosophoric functional groups and modification of alkyl&#8208;bridge length modifies the properties of the obtained energetic materials. The investigated compounds were synthesized in good yields and characterized exhaustively.







Abstract
Starting from 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;4&#8208;methylaminopyrazole (2), six different energetic salts and three new derivatives of methylene bridged nitropyrazoles were synthesized. The derivatives bear a methylamino (4), methylnitramino (5), and azido group (7). All compounds were intensively characterized using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and DTA/TGA measurements. The sensitivities were determined according to BAM standard methods and the energetic properties calculated using the EXPLO5 code. The energetic salts were compared with each other and with ANTA in terms of their energetic properties. On the basis of the methyl&#8208; and ethyl bridged derivatives, it was shown how the introduction of methylamino (4) and methylnitramino (5) groups in an alkyl&#8208;bridged nitropyrazole system modify its properties (performance &amp; sensitivities). In addition, azido compound 7 was contrasted with its literature&#8208;known constitutional isomer and investigated for its suitability as a potential metal&#8208;free primary explosive.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using a catalytic amount of porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework Por&#8208;Ad&#8208;COF as the efficient recyclable photocatalyst, the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and N&#8208;arylmaleimides was developed under aerobic conditions at room temperature. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition and oxidative aromatization cascade process under visible light irradiation. This was the first example to employ the covalent organic framework as the heterogeneous photocatalyst to perform the photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Non&#8208;Proteinogenic N4&#8208;Substituted Asparagine: Racemic, Enantioenriched, and Deuterated Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective carbamoylation strategy to access non&#8208;proteinogenic N4&#8208;modified asparagines is reported. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, high functional group compatibility, and a wide diversity of functionalized carbamoyl radicals. The protocol was further extended to access a large chemical space of N4&#8208;asparagine conjugates (racemic, enantioenriched and deuterated).







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective carbamoylation strategy to access non&#8208;proteinogenic N4&#8208;modified asparagines has been described. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, high functional group compatibility, and a wide diversity of functionalized carbamoyl radicals making possible the access to peptides, pharmaceuticals, and natural N4&#8208;asparagine conjugates, as well as enantioenriched unnatural N4&#8208;asparagines. Besides that, deuterated analogues were achieved with the insertion of D2O and enantioenriched derivatives could be obtained in 15&#8197;min in continuous&#8208;flow conditions.

         <title>Employing Click Chemistry to Expand the Scope of the Metal&#8208;Free Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Photocatalyst 4CzIPN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design of a versatile alkyne&#8208;bearing derivative of the donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophore 2,4,5,6&#8209;tetrakis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN) suitable for further targeted modifications via copper catalysed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC). The newly synthesised photoredox catalyst notably exhibits analogously unique photoelectronic and steric features as the well&#8208;established carbazolyl dicyanobenzene motif and performs equally in a C&#8209;C&#8208;coupling model reaction. Furthermore, the variability of this donor&#8208;acceptor system was demonstrated by the generation of a library of fourteen photoredox catalysts with electron withdrawing and donating groups as well as residues with high steric demands in one simple and selective CuAAC reaction. The modified catalysts feature a broad scope of reducing and oxidising powers in their excited states (span of reducing powers over more than 1&#160;V) and were also successfully applied in the photoredox and nickel catalysed decarboxylative cross coupling model reaction. This work represents a method to overcome the limitations in the flexibility of metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores required for the targeted application in organic synthesis and paves the way for the design of customised catalysts with multiple functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Dithieno&#173;pyrazines: Structure&#8211;Property Relationships</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithienopyrazines are only scarcly used as building blocks in organic electronic materials. Here, we report efficient preparation and investigation of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;dithienopyrazines, which were functionalized with triaraylamine units to provide different series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type materials. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties resulted in valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and allowed for the elucidation of the influence of structural effects such as core structure (syn vs anti), type of substituents (directly arylated vs ethynylated aryl), and substitution pattern (&#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208; vs &#946;,&#946;&#8216;&#8208; vs fourfold substitution). Finally, first application of a dithienopyrazine derivative as model for hole&#8208;transport materials tailored for organic electronic devices has been realized.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonmammalian 8&#8208;carbon saccharide 3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulsonic acid (Kdo) is the structural unit of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and capsular polysaccharides. In the inner core region of LPSs, Kdo is present, and this region is structurally conserved.

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Based on SO2 Surrogates: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have become popular tools for the efficient generation of sulfonyl&#8208;containing molecules. Compared with gaseous SO2, the solid and stable sulfur dioxide surrogates are more convenient to handle. This significantly promotes the development of multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions, and some advances have been achieved in the asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones.







Abstract
Compounds containing sulfonyl&#8208;derived functional groups have received intensive attention owing to their widespread applications in life science, pharmaceuticals and materials science. To access this type of compounds, the multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions relying on sulfur dioxide (SO2) insertion strategy have emerged as novel and attractive approaches in the past decade. The utilization of SO2 surrogates for SO2 insertion in the multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have improved reaction flexibility and step economy. Moreover, some advances have been achieved in the challenging but practical asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones. This review aims to summarize the progress made in the MCRs involving SO2 surrogates from 2019 to 2022, and point out the potentials and challenges in this field.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective peri&#8208; and ortho&#8208;Halogenation of 1&#8208;Naphthaldehydes: Application to the Synthesis of Polycyclic Natural Product Skeletons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective halogenation reaction of 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes was disclosed. When aldehyde was used as directing group, a C8&#8208;selectivity was observed whereas an imine formation was necessary to achieve C2&#8208;halogenation. The mechanism as well as the regioselectivity of the reaction were studied and the halogenated products were used in the synthesis of natural product skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, a regioselective bromination or chlorination reaction of 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. Without additive, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation showed a C8&#8208;regioselectivity, whereas the formation of an aromatic imine intermediate allowed a switch to a C2&#8208;reactivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations were performed to explain the regioselectivity and the synthesized halogenated products were used as key building blocks to access polycyclic natural product skeletons.

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodomyrtone Analogs Modified at C7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various analogs of rhodomyrtone with different acyl groups at C7 were prepared by selective chlorination of the core structure at C5 followed by a Duff formylation at C7. After protection of the phenolic OH groups, a sequence of Grignard reaction, oxidation, and deprotection led to the analogs. Some of them turned out to be very active.







Abstract
We developed a route to rhodomyrtone analogs that feature different acyl groups at C7. Since electrophilic substitution reactions on the aryl part of the rhodomyrtone core led to C5 derivatives, the C5 position was blocked by a chlorine. Subsequent Duff type formylation followed by Grignard addition to the aldehyde group and oxidation gave various phenones. The benzyl protecting groups were removed by hydrogenation or boron tribromide. Some derivatives turned out to be quite active against multiple resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and a rhodomyrtone resistant mutant (RomR). The chlorine at C5 seems to have a beneficial effect on the antibacterial activity.

Scalable and efficient approaches towards the synthesis of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;disubstituted mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoromethylcyclobutane building blocks are disclosed. Effects of the fluoroalkyl substituents and other structural features on their physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and aqueous solubility) are evaluated.







Abstract
Synthesis and physicochemical characterization of all possible cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane&#8208;derived amines and carboxylic acids bearing mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups at the C&#8208;3 position is disclosed. Tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF)&#8208; or morpholinosulfur trifluoride (Morph&#8208;DAST)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of appropriate cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomeric substrates was used as the key step for the preparation of CH2F&#8208; and CHF2&#8208;substituted derivatives. To obtain the corresponding cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric CF3&#8208;substituted derivatives, resolution of known 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (obtained as a mixture of diastereomers) was applied. The proposed procedures were suitable for the preparation of corresponding fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutane&#8208;derived amines and carboxylic acids on up to 50&#8197;g scale. All 12 building blocks obtained were characterized by measuring dissociation constants (pKa) and lipophilicities (LogP, for model derivatives) to evaluate the effect of the fluoroalkyl substituents on their physicochemical properties relevant to further drug discovery applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Amination&#8208;Based Strategy for N&#8208;Amino Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free chemoselective approach for the C&#8722;H amination of electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;aryl hydrazones is developed. This approach represents an easy transformation of readily available precursors into biological relevant N&#8208;based heterocycles in the absence of transition metal catalysts.







Abstract
An oxidative cyclization of electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;arylhydrazones promoted by phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) has been accomplished. This metal&#8208;free, chemoselective transformation allows to obtain synthetically and medicinally important N&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles, obviating the need for pre&#8208;functionalization of substrates.

         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified for a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade process for synthesis and conversion of a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8211;Alder adduct proceeds with high conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% by coupling of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a rapid hydrogenation. A rotating reaction vessel leads to a thin film of the intermediate, which then slowly dissolves into an immediately convertible solution.







Abstract
In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in nearly completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8211;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8211;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.

         <title>Stereoselective Mannich Reactions in the Synthesis of Enantiopure Piperidine Alkaloids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent syntheses of enantiopure pharmaceutically relevant piperidines using Mannich reactions is presented. The asymmetric induction has been classified in three conceptual approaches using the chiral pool, chiral auxilliaries and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Piperidine alkaloids are members of the alkaloid family that is characterized by the presence of a six&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle. Piperidine alkaloids are found mainly in plants and often exhibit interesting biological and pharmacological activities. Despite the accumulation of these natural products in plants, relatively low quantities of alkaloids are produced in absolute terms and thus synthesis of alkaloids and derivatives thereof remains relevant to identify targets for drug discovery. Throughout the years, researchers have come up with a myriad of methods to synthesize piperidine derivatives. This review describes methods that employ stereoselective Mannich reactions to create the core of piperidine alkaloids. Asymmetric induction in the Mannich reaction has been achieved by a range of methods that have been divided into three conceptual approaches: (1)&#8197;chiral pool&#8208;based (internal asymmetric induction), (2)&#8197;chiral auxiliary&#8208;based (relayed asymmetric induction) and (3)&#8197;asymmetric catalysis&#8208;based (external asymmetric induction). Of each approach, we describe the reaction mechanism and rationalize the stereochemical outcome of the Mannich products.

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on Redox Behavior and Halogen Exchange in Telluropyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of tellurium (Te) into polycyclic compounds may endow them with unique chemical and optoelectronic properties which are not observed in their lighter chalcogen analogues. Herein, a telluropyran&#8208;containing polycyclic compound (T1) synthesized via a ring&#8208;expansion reaction from corresponding tellurophene analogue can be reversibly oxidized into halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) with the formation of two Te&#8208;X bonds. Their chemical structures are verified by two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H correlation spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The halogen oxidations of T1 and the reverse thermal eliminations as well as the halogen exchange in halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 have been systematically investigated and compared by UV&#8208;vis absorption titration, electrochemical measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional calculations. The oxidation of Te(II) in T1 to Te(IV) in T1&#8226;X2 results in the switch from aromaticity to nonaromaticity for the six&#8208;membered telluropyran ring, as revealed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. It is also found that the halides in the adducts can be exchanged by lighter ones, but not vice versa. The stabilities of the oxidized products are in the order of T1&#8226;Cl2 &gt; T1&#8226;Br2 &gt; T1&#8226;I2, which are consistent with the calculated rate constants and energy barriers of the elimination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Triethylamine&#8208;Mediated Transformation of Phosphonates into Phosphonamidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds such as phosphonamidates are gaining attention across different fields of chemistry, with interesting applications as pharmaceuticals, or pesticides. However, practical application of phosphonamidates is complicated by their difficult syntheses which often involve expensive or unstraightforward reagents and harsh conditions. To remedy these issues, we present a flexible, room temperature synthesis for novel P&#8208;alkylphosphonamidates without the need for intermediary purification. Commonly available phosphonates are first chlorinated by use of oxalyl chloride and phosphonylaminium salts are used to mediate the harsh reactivity of phosphonochloridates, giving rise to the desired products. We demonstrate the compatibility of our protocol with primary and secondary amines, as well as with different phosphonate esters. The proposed pathway also enables the synthesis of primary phosphonamidates using ammonium acetate as a cheap and safe alternative for ammonia. In future research, this protocol will also enable the synthesis of bioactive targets that are incompatible with current protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxetane Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction: A Key Step for the Preparation of Substituted (Fluoro)alkenyl as Acyclonucleoside Mimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxetane ring&#8208;opening reaction was achieved selectively to afford geometry&#8208;controlled tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes as acyclonucleosides precursors. Preliminary enzymatic essays suggest a similarity between nucleosides and obtained fluoroacyclonucleosides.







Abstract
Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes, including fluoroalkenes, were prepared by a selective ring&#8208;opening reaction of functionalized oxetanes. The introduction of adenine nucleic base allows the synthesis of alkenyl and fluoroalkenyl derivatives that were evaluated towards DltA enzyme as potential nucleoside mimics.

         <title>Organocatalytic Upgrading of Biomass Derived Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The depletion of finite primary fossil fuels makes necessary a progressive transition from finite primary fossil sources to alternative renewable raw materials to produce high value chemicals important for our everyday life. Greener processes must be designed to face the current challenge of climate change. In this context, organocatalysis offers a valuable opportunity for upgrading bio&#8208;derived platform compounds in the frame of green and sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The depletion of finite primary fossil fuels we are facing makes necessary a deep metamorphosis in fundamental parts of the chemical industry. A progressive transition from petro&#8208;based starting materials toward renewable biomass&#8208;derived sources will have to take place in the synthesis of added&#8208;value chemicals, important for our everyday life, such as pharmaceuticals, polymers, agrochemicals etc. Moreover, greener processes, carried out under friendlier reaction conditions, must be designed to address current concerns about the climate change and the resulting pressing need to reduce the environmental footprint of chemical processes. To this end, organocatalysis could offer a valuable opportunity for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived platform molecules in line with the principles of Green Chemistry. This review presents some of recent and remarkable advancements in this emerging area. Organocatalysis has proven to be an efficient tool to transform low value bio&#8208;based renewable platform building blocks into new high value bio&#8208;based chemicals, with potential applications as synthetic intermediates, innovative materials and pharmaceutically active compounds.

         <title>Free Carboxylic Acids: The Trend of Radical Decarboxylative Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical decarboxylation enables the facile access to carbon&#8208;centered radicals. Using native carboxylic acids as the precursors of these open&#8208;shell species, a wide variety of remarkable transformations have been disclosed within the past few years. This review outlines the most recent development to demonstrate the attractiveness of this enabling strategy.







Abstract
The exceptional versatility of carboxylic acids has been extensively exploited in organic synthesis across several decades. There has been a recent upsurge of radical decarboxylative transformations. The process can be initiated under mild conditions, and the resultant radicals have orthogonal reactivities to closed&#8208;shell species, thus providing immense opportunities for streamlining novel reactions. The use of free carboxylic acids is the most desirable owing to its high atom and step economy. Aiming to demonstrate the attractiveness of the strategy and to inspire chemists to tackle existing challenges, this review outlines the recent advances on radical decarboxylative functionalization of free carboxylic acids.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Enhanced Production and Synthesis of 2,5&#8208; Furandicarboxylic Acid under CO2 Flow through the Henkel Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study investigated the preparation of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via the Henkel reaction between furoic acid alkali metal salts and zinc chloride under a continuous CO2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The results obtained were compared with those of previous studies that used high&#8208;pressure conditions or toxic cadmium catalysts. The pathways and rate&#8208;determining steps of the reaction are revealed for the first time. Furthermore, the enhanced formation of FDCA through the promotion of carboxyl exchange and rearrangement during the reaction under a CO2 flow was examined. The CO2&#8208;rich environment afforded a high FDCA yield of 86.30%, which is the highest yield obtained to date using the Henkel reaction. The findings of this study offer economically improved conditions for large&#8208;scale FDCA production.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Indazole Acetic Acids by N&#8208;N Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the discovery and development of novel cascade N&#8208;N bond forming reactions for the synthesis of rare indazole acetic acid scaffolds. This approach allows for convenient synthesis of three distinct indazole acetic acid derivatives (unsubstituted, hydroxy, and alkoxy) by heating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;nitroaryl)propanoic acids with an appropriate nucleophile/solvent under basic conditions. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups and electronic effects and, in total, 23 novel indazole acetic acids were synthesized and characterized.

This approach allows for convenient synthesis of three distinct indazole acetic acid derivatives (unsubstituted, hydroxy, and alkoxy) by heating 3-amino-3-(2-nitroaryl)propanoic acids with an appropriate nucleophile/solvent under basic conditions. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups and electronic effects and, in total, 23 novel indazole acetic acids were synthesized and characterized. This work offers a valuable strategy for the synthesis of useful scaffolds for drug discovery programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8216;Novel synthesis strategy for the production of fully bio&#8208;based binders using 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran&#8217;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, resol based binders were prepared with lignin, resorcinol and the bio&#8208;based aldehydic platform chemicals 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF). In preliminary studies, the solubility and stability of DFF in aqueous&#8208;alkaline conditions was investigated. Various binders were prepared to investigate the influence of the HMF&#8208;DFF ratio and the influence of the aldehyde concentration on the molar mass, rheological properties and curing characteristics of the final binders. It is shown that significantly higher molecular weights and viscosities are obtained by using DFF instead of HMF. The properties of the final binder could also be affected by the precise choice of DFF concentration, as this resulted in higher levels of crosslinking. This work offers a novel type of fully biobased binder that consists of non&#8208;toxic components and is therefore less hazardous than some conventional binders.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids are synthesized in two steps from linear or branched carboxylic acid feedstocks. In the first step, the carboxylic acid is coupled with tert&#8208;butyl aminocarbonate (BocNHOH) to generate azanyl ester (acyloxycarbamate) RCO2NHBoc. In the second step, this azanyl ester undergoes a stereocontrolled iron&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;nitrogen migration to generate the N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected non&#8208;racemic &#945;&#8208;amino acid. This straightforward protocol is applicable to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids with aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl side chains. Furthermore, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids are accessible in an enantioconvergent fashion from racemic carboxylic acids. The new method is also advantageous for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino acids. N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids synthesized using this two&#8208;step protocol are ready&#8208;to&#8208;use building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Economical and Environmentally Friendly Organic hydrazone Derivatives Characterized by a Heteroaromatic Core as Potential Hole Transporting Materials in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich hydrazone&#8208;based molecules centred on thiophene or pyrrole &#960;&#8208;bridges have been investigated in their optical and electrochemical properties as potential hole transport material for use in perovskite solar cells. A brief cost analysis has also been carried out to evaluate the sustainability of their synthetic process.







Abstract
A series of organic electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;bridged symmetric hydrazones, composed of two donor moieties connected through a thiophene&#8208; or a pyrrole&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;spacer, has been synthesized as a suitable alternative to 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis[N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino]&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), considered the benchmark hole transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The cheap synthetic protocol is suitable for potential large&#8208;scale production. All the compounds were characterized, showing good energy levels alignments with the perovskite and very close energy levels to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed the electrochemical trend observed. The costs of synthesis were estimated, as well as the produced waste to synthesise the final HTMs, underlining the low impact of these compounds on the environment with the respect to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize alternative to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for industrial development of PSCs.

         <title>Facile Suzuki Coupling Strategy toward New Nile Red Derivatives with Improved Two&#8208;Photon Brightness</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 14 Nile Red analogues with (hetero)aryl substituents at the 2&#8208; or 3&#8208;positions were synthesized from convenient Suzuki couplings. Two&#8208;photon excitation efficiency and general fluorescent properties were evaluated. A 4&#8208;aminophenyl group resulted in extreme solvent sensitivity, and a thien&#8208;2&#8208;yl group led to significantly redshifted emission, large Stokes shift and high two&#8208;photon brightness.







Abstract
Chemical fine&#8208;tuning of fluorophores is a pivotal step towards development of next generation fluorescent dyes for microscopy. With the advent of high&#8208;resolution two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence imaging, there is a growing demand for very sensitive laser dyes that can be efficiently excited using commercial Ti:sapphire laser sources in the first near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;I, 780&#8211;1020&#8197;nm). Using the fluorescent dye Nile Red as the lead structure, we report a robust and concise Suzuki coupling approach for the synthesis of 14 new Nile Red analogues that feature extended &#960; ring systems and diverse functionalities. For this set, we gauged their two&#8208;photon excitation efficiency in NIR&#8208;I as well as evaluated their general fluorescent properties (emission wavelength, Stokes shift, quantum yield and solvatochromism). Several of the new fluorophores were found to display very favorable characteristics. In particular, the derivative featuring a 4&#8208;aminophenyl group in the 2&#8208;position of Nile Red exhibited extreme solvent sensitivity, and the thien&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituted Nile Red derivative showed significantly redshifted emission, large Stokes shift and high two&#8208;photon brightness.

         <title>Multifaceted Behavior of 2&#8208;Cyanobenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;Acylbenzonitriles in the Synthesis of Isoindolinones, Phthalides and Related Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: 2&#8208;Cyanobenzaldehye (also called 2&#8208;formylbenzonitrile) and related 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles belong to a class of bifunctional aromatic compounds that emerged as useful starting materials in developing efficient cascade&#8208;type reactions leading to different heterocyclic compounds. The variety of sometimes unpredictable mechanisms that rise from these structurally simple starting materials renders this class of compounds unique to afford, through divergent cascade reactions, heterocycles like isoindolinones, phthalides (also known with the name of isobenzofuranones), imidates, and in less extent isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;imine, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, porphyrins, also in asymmetric way exploiting different organocatalytic activation modes. To give a picture, this chemistry can be associated to Goldberg variations which stem from a common motive in a pressing and surprising way. Emphasis is also given to the synthetic methods for the access to substituted 2&#8208;cyanobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles which allowed to enlarge the scope of the described cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Perspective on the Mechanochemical Method To Reduce Carbonyl Groups with Stainless Steel and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical reduction of the carbonyl group has been investigated using temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. The design of solvent&#8208;free organic transformation has resulted in increased interest in mechanochemistry, the water&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reduction was conducted in a stainless&#8208;steel vial. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds through a single electron transfer pathway, with iron and nickel as essential components for the reaction.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry through high&#8208;speed ball milling has become an increasingly popular method for performing organic transformations. This newfound interest in high&#8208;speed ball milling is in part driven by the benefit of performing reactions in the absence of solvent. Mechanochemical reactions are often conducted in stainless&#8208;steel vials with stainless&#8208;steel balls. Since stainless steel is made of several readily oxidizable metals (Fe, Cr, and Ni), reduction reactions using water as a hydrogen source were explored using a temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) pathway, with iron and nickel being essential components for the reaction.

         <title>The meta and para OH Substitution Effect on C&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Nitrilimine Bond&#8208;Shift Isomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometric and electronic structure of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, in particular of nitrile imines, can be surprisingly intricate. A particular example is the C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimine, which exists as two energy minima that constitute bond&#8208;shift isomers. Questioning whether substituents in the phenyl ring could affect the existence of such bond&#8208;shift isomers, here we investigate the meta and para OH substituted derivatives. These two nitrile imines were generated in an argon matrix at 15 K by UV&#8208;irradiation of 2H&#8208;tetrazole precursors and found to photoisomerize to carbodiimides via 1H&#8208;diazirines. Using IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations, the C&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist as two bond&#8208;shift isomers, with predominant propargylic and allenic type structures, whereas the C&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist only as one species with a significant allenic type structure. The different effects of the OH substitution in meta and para positions on the bond&#8208;shift isomerism are rationalized with the support of Natural Resonance Theory and Hirshfeld atomic charges. Such fundamental knowledge, on the understanding of how substitution affects the structural characteristics of C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimines, opens the door to modulate the chemistry of this important class of reactive compounds (e.g. in cycloaddition reactions) by appropriate tuning of their substitution (substituent type and position).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Remdesivir by Direct Lithiation of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazine Derivatives Enabled C&#8208;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct and regioselective lithiation was realized on N&#8208;Boc pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazine, simply utilizing the distinct sigma&#8208;acidity on C&#8208;9. Starting from this enabling discovery, C&#8208;glycoside formation, cyanation, and global deprotection steps constitute one of the most efficient syntheses of GS&#8208;441524. Furthermore, transient protection was applied on GS&#8208;441524 with phenyl boronic acid, and facilitated a powerful one&#8208;pot synthesis of remdesivir.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Multicomponent Synthesis of Oxazolidinones from Primary Amines and Cesium (Hydrogen)Carbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines, dibromoethane (DBE), and the usage of either cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source is reported. The applicability of this technically simple reaction was demonstrated by a broad scope with generally high yields, enabling concise late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino groups into N&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones. The proposed operating reaction mechanism consists of a first&#8208;step nucleophilic substitution reaction between DBE and the primary amine, followed by the formation of a carbamate or carbonate intermediate and subsequent cyclization. Additional versatility of the herein&#8208;developed protocol has been showcased in a medicinal chemistry approach by the generation of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylselanyl Benzothiophenes through Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylselanyl)benzothiophenes has gained significant attention from the synthetic community due to their promising biological features as drug candidates. While notable syntheses of these compounds have been reported, they have certain limitations, such as the need for sensitive/harsh reaction conditions, toxic/sensitive catalysts or reagents. We developed a novel method for synthesizing 3&#8208;arylselanyl benzothiophenes through visible light&#8208;mediated radical cyclization. Diaryl selenides were used as aryl selenium sources under the irradiation of white LEDs (5 W). The reactions were conducted under mild conditions, where the desired products were obtained at room temperature without the need for catalysts or additives.&#160;Our method facilitates the rapid access to various benzothiophene derivatives, which are important scaffolds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents Bearing Transferable N&#8208;Based Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine reagents have the ability of inverting the polarity of functional groups bound to iodine, a reactivity known as umpolung. This reactivity makes hypervalent iodine compounds highly attractive for the creation of electrophilic synthons of known nucleophiles. This strategy results in novel synthetic disconnections and the creation of new Nu(nucleophile)&#8208;N bond.
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Traditionally, these reagents are limited to few examples. With the use of hypervalent iodine, the transfer of a wide diversity of nitrogen sources became a possibility. This review compiles the latest reported examples of hypervalent iodine reagents capable of electrophilic transfer of nitrogen&#8208;based groups. It showcases the preparation of such reagents, their synthetic utility and reaction mechanisms involving these group transfer reagents.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalysts with a triazole linker from diphenyl prolinol were developed. Their catalytic activity, substrate scope, and reusability were demonstrated in asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes.







Abstract
A new class of polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalysts with a triazole linker from diphenyl prolinol were developed. Their catalytic activity was tested in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes. The substrate scope of this catalysis was studied under the optimized reaction conditions. The reusability of the polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalyst was demonstrated up to four cycles. Based on the reaction results, a reaction mechanism was proposed for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes.

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.
