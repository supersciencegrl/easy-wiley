         <title>An Electrochemical Method for the Direct Sulfonylation of N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrochemical strategy for the synthesis of sulfonylphenol derivatives from N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with sulfonyl hydrazides has been successfully developed. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free protocol is suitable for aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic reagents to afford the corresponding sulfonylated products in moderate to high yields under mild conditions. Notably, we successfully scaled up the reaction to gram quantities, underscoring its potential for larger&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, the synthesized sulfonylphenol derivatives exhibited promising in&#8197;vitro antibacterial activity, highlighting their potential therapeutic relevance.

         <title>Reactions of Unsymmetric Chiral Dialdehydes with Lysine: Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Macrocyclization and Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes are discovered to undergo regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions with an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine, to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. Addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. These compounds are also found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.







Abstract
Three BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (S)&#8208;4, (S)&#8208;5, and (S)&#8208;6, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (S)&#8208;4 and (S)&#8208;5 are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.

         <title>Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Ritter&#8208;Type C&#8722;H Amination of Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type amination of alkylarenes with nitriles is reported, in which the alkylarene is first brominated by CBr3COOH under Ce(III) catalysis and blue light irradiation, and the resulting bromide then undergoes the normal Ritter reaction to afford the amide product.







Abstract
Reported here is a photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type C&#8722;H amination of alkylarenes with nitriles. Under the irradiation of blue light and the catalysis of a simple Ce(III) salt, alkylarenes were brominated by CBr3COOH and thereby channeled to the normal Ritter pathway to afford amide products. A wide range of alkylarenes and nitriles were tolerated, with a few equivalents of a nitrile being feasible.

         <title>Facile Access to Phospholene Fused Polycycles through Intramolecular Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of Phosphole Sulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile and straightforward pathway for construction of phosphorus containing polycyclic compounds through Alder&#8208;ene reaction of the 1,n&#8208;enyne moiety. This work also has demonstrated the advance and feasibility of the alkene cyclization strategy in the synthesis of structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds and naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons.







Abstract
We have developed a simple, metal&#8208;free annulation of phosphole sulfides through intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;enyne component. This atom&#8208;efficient cyclization pathway provides phospholene fused polycycles with high yields and excellent regioselectivity. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization of phosphole sulfides with a phenyl group affords structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds. Meanwhile, phosphole sulfides with a naphthyl group produce naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons, as well as structurally complex [2+2] cycloaddition products.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores methods to convert alkylboronic esters into alkyl amines, high value motifs found in bioactive molecules, materials, and catalysts. Three distinct reaction pathways are discussed: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangements, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.







Abstract
Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8722;B bond in a range of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Photoredox Catalyzed Synthesis of Indolyl &#916;2&#8208;Isoxazolines via a Formal C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrogenative photoredox catalyzed formal C(sp3)&#8208;H intramolecular cyclization of indolyl&#8208;oximes to generate indolyl &#916;2&#8208;isoxazolines is reported. In contrast to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the reaction avoids the use of super stoichiometric chemical oxidants and high reaction temperatures and is proposed to operate via two sequential single electron oxidation events.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkoxylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, producing only hydrogen as a by&#8208;product. This method efficiently functionalizes a wide range of alcohols, enabling the synthesis of celestolide and diphenhydramine derivatives.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical process for the direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds without the need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. This environmentally friendly and sustainable synthetic strategy facilitates the alkoxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H in benzylic groups. The approach enables the late&#8208;stage incorporation of complex alkoxy groups into bioactive molecules, providing potential applications in the synthesis of celestolide derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) protocol is developed for converting dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) to 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). Methanol served as both the hydrogen donor and solvent, while a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst is employed.

Abstract
A novel and efficient protocol for the conversion of dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) into 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) was proposed via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH). In this approach, methanol functioned as both the hydrogen donor and the solvent, and a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst was utilized for facilitating the reaction. Under the specified conditions at 235&#8201;&#176;C, a conversion of 96.61&#8201;% with a selectivity of 60.71&#8201;% was achieved. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, comprehensive characterizations were conducted to examine the catalysts with varying ZrO2 contents. The investigation revealed that the reaction begins with the adsorption of DMCD and methanol onto the acidic sites of the catalyst, followed by their activation on the reduced&#8208;state Cu.

         <title>Utilizing N&#8208;Hydroxylamine&#8208;Based Active Esters for the Synthesis of Oseltamivir Amide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;derived active esters were synthesized from oseltamivir, which can serve as practical synthetic handles to prepare oseltamivir analogs. Succinimide&#8208;based active ester was the most effective derivative for synthesizing a series of oseltamivir carboxamides.







Abstract
Functionalizing and derivatizing pharmaceuticals are essential for preparing new potentially active compounds. This work shows how active esters derived from oseltamivir carboxylate can be useful synthetic tools for accessing various amide derivatives of oseltamivir. Six hydroxylamine active esters were synthesized directly from oseltamivir carboxylate, and their utility in preparing amide derivatives was evaluated. Succinimide ester 5&#8201;e was the most efficient in terms of its preparation and in synthesizing oseltamivir derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread presence of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in natural products and chemical materials, along with their extensive applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, has inspired significant efforts to develop new synthetic methods for constructing C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, enabling various useful transformations under mild reaction conditions. In recent years, readily accessible N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and ylides have emerged as highly promising scaffolds for the generation of N&#8208;centered radicals under photocatalytic conditions. These pyridinium reagents can also serve as bifunctional substrates, providing a variety of useful pyridine&#8208;containing products. This review comprehensively addresses significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates, aiming to provide organic chemists with detailed insights to drive further expansion in this field.

In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community. This review comprehensively includes all the significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates.

         <title>Photoinduced, Decarboxylative Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids with Diselenides to Form Selenoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and green strategy for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives has been developed through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides. This transformation proceeds smoothly without requiring any external photocatalyst, additive, or oxidant. Both diaryl and dialkyl diselenides react efficiently with &#945;&#8208;keto acids to produce selenoesters in good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the generated acyl radical is responsible for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 2&#8208;((Hetera)cyclo)alkylchromanols and their Spirocyclic Analogs through Enzymatic Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 2&#8208;((hetera)cyclo)alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on enzymatic resolution is described. It is shown that enzymatic acylation could be used for the preparation of enantioenriched title compounds with primary alkyl substituents at the C&#8208;2 position. Meanwhile, enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates was optimal for the preparation of the target alcohols when significant steric hindrance is present, e.g., due to the &#945;&#8208;branching. The latter factor was demonstrated to be crucial for the enzymatic reaction rate in both cases. The synthetic utility of the obtained chiral alcohols was demonstrated through Mitsunobu configuration inversion, as well as by preparation of the corresponding primary amines &#8211; valuable sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Sulfoxide Ligands in Asymmetric Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of the transition metals (Pd, Ru, Rh) in conjuction with chiral sulfoxide ligands applied in asymmetric allylic substitution from 2013 to 2024 has been documented. Based on this summary, a perspective into chiral sulfoxide ligands in the future is provided.







Abstract
Chiral nitrogen&#8208;, and phosphorus&#8208;based ligands have been extensively investigated in the asymmetric allylic reactions. However, chiral sulfoxides have not been deemed as a class of practical chiral ligands until last decade, despite several distinct advantages over traditional ligand scaffolds, such as the proximity of the chiral information to the metal center and the ability to switch between S and O coordination. This perspective collects the recent development of chiral sulfoxide ligands for asymmetric allylation since the beginning of 2013. In addition, insights into the future development of this type of promising ligand are discussed.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Michael&#8208;type Addition of Amines to 2&#8208;Arylvinylidenebisphosphonates: Bisphosphonate Elimination via a Retro&#8208;Aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;type Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Attempts to synthesize 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoethyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates as potential antiparasitic agents from tetraethyl 2&#8208;arylvinylidenebisphosphonate and a suitable alkyl amine led to (E)&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;arylmethaimines instead of the expected Michael&#8208;type adduct. This chemical behavior was not observed when used mercaptans as soft nucleophiles resulting in the corresponding sulfur'&#8208;containing Michael&#8208;type adducts. A reasonable reaction mechanism was proposed.







Abstract
Encouraged by the potent inhibitory effect exhibited by long chain 2&#8208;alkylaminoethyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates against proliferation of the clinically more relevant form of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), and against tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, the responsible agent of toxoplasmosis, it was conceived a new series of structurally related 1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates bearing a phenyl group at the C&#8208;2 position of the title compounds. The synthetic approach to access these compounds employed a Michael&#8208;type addition by reaction of tetraethyl 2&#8208;phenylvinylidenebisphosphonate or substituted phenyl group with a suitable amine. To our surprise the reaction experienced a retro&#8208;Michael type reaction resulting in an imine formation instead of the hypothetical and expected Michael&#8208;type adduct. Obtainment of the imine derivatives was observed regardless of the nature of the substituent at the phenyl moiety. The source of the alkyl chain was the alkyl group of the amine substrate. Interestingly, when mercaptans were used as soft nucleophiles, the Michael&#8208;type adducts were obtained in all cases.

         <title>Modern Methods for Conjugated Polymers Preparation: A Concept of Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers (CPs) are promising organic materials currently at the center of the organic electronics revolution. Synthesis strategies play a crucial role in the rise of this field, and this review aims to shed light on transition metal&#8208;free organic chemistry for the synthesis of conjugated polymers, which is currently experiencing a renaissance.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling technology is still the cornerstone of conjugated polymer synthesis. However, most cross&#8208;coupling reactions rely on platinum group metals (e.&#8201;g. rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum), and the supply of these rare and expensive metal catalysts is at risk, making the use of these reactions unsustainable. In addition, the contamination of conjugated polymers with trace metallic catalysts is another concern, especially for organic electronics where the products are used in devices whose performance can be affected by even &#8242;undetectable&#8217; levels of metal contaminant. In pursuit of more sustainable chemistry in the future, various organic reactions have been utilized for the synthesis of conjugated polymers without the aid of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Presented herein is a comprehensive overview of organic reactions for the synthesis of conjugated polymers that go beyond transition metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discuss metal&#8208;free synthesis strategies and methods in detail and divide them into &#8220;condensation&#8221; reactions, &#8220;click&#8221; reactions and other miscellaneous reactions. Reaction mechanisms and key intermediates are also elucidated. The aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights that will enable them to innovate and expand the horizons of conjugated polymer synthesis.

         <title>Trimethylsilyl Polyphosphate Promoted Efficient Synthesis of 4(3H)&#8208;Quinazolinones from Methyl Anthranilate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4(3H)&#8208;quinazolinones with variable steric and electronic features were synthesized with good to excellent yields by trimethylsilylpolyphosphate (PPSE) promoted reaction of secondary amides and methyl anthranilates. The reaction is metal and ligand free, involving easily available starting materials, and suitable for scaling up. The one pot modification, which comprises 2 or 3 steps, was also efficient.







Abstract
A trimethylsilyl polyphosphate (PPSE) promoted synthesis of 4(3H)&#8208;quinazolinones, a heterocycle with wide biological potential, from methyl anthranilate and secondary amides is described. The procedure is general, involves very easily available starting materials, shows functional group tolerance and leads to good to excellent yields. The method proved to be suitable for scaling&#8208;up. A one&#8208;pot approach was also explored. This step&#8208;economic modification reduces the time, waste and environmental impact of the synthesis and leads to satisfactory global yields that include 2 or 3 single steps. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism that involves a nitrilium cation intermediate is proposed.

         <dc:description>
Using a system mediated by iodine(III) and tetrabutylammonium halides, unexpected ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenation addition reaction of isocoumarins were achieved, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.







Abstract
Iodine(III)&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenated addition reaction have been realized. A series of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives bearing multiple functional groups were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies indicated that the reaction proceeds via a proton transfer followed by ring opening and ring formation to produce the target product. Moreover, preliminary biological evaluations revealed that both of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives show good antitumor activities.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the difunctionalization strategy of unsaturated bonds has served as a robust and elegant strategy for ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. Compared with previous research, the application of benzophenone reagents that generate two free radicals under visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer conditions can greatly streamline the reaction steps, improving the reaction efficiency and optimizing the reaction conditions. In this short review, the recent advance in developing the bifunctionalization of unsaturated bonds by diphenylmethanone oxime ester reagents is concisely described.







Abstract
The concurrent installation of C&#8722;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8722;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8722;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the advancements of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. We discuss the ongoing challenges of selectivity, particularly in remote (meta/para) C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization, and the reliance on directing groups. Insights from 2018 to 2024 are categorized by reaction type, revealing mechanistic developments that promise enhanced efficiency and broader applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8722;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.

A series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted derivatives of 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides with different combinations of aryl and arylalkynyl substituents were synthesized through regioselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions and tested for biological activity.







Abstract
Several series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides were synthesized to investigate their biological activities. The key&#8208;intermediate chloronucleosides were prepared by an anion&#8208;base glycosylation with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloro&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine. The target compounds were obtained by diazotation, either Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions in the case of 2&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;hetaryl nucleosides or two consecutive Suzuki reactions in the case of 2,6&#8208;diaryl nucleosides. The sequence of diazotation and the first Suzuki reaction is flexible and can be changed depending on the target compounds. Some of the final nucleosides showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines and low antagonistic activity against a panel of adenosine receptors.

&lt;p&gt;Several series of 2,6-disubstituted 7-deazapurine ribonucleosides were synthesized to investigate their biological activities. The key-intermediate chloronucleosides were prepared by an anion-base glycosylation with 2-amino-6-chloro-7-deazapurine. The target compounds were obtained by diazotation, either Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions in the case of 2-arylethynyl-6-hetaryl nucleosides or two consecutive Suzuki reactions in the case of 2,6-diaryl nucleosides. The sequence of diazotation and the first Suzuki reaction is flexible and can be changed depending on the target compounds.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for synthesizing 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was established through sequential click cycloaddition and aminations mediated by triazolyl(Mes)iodonium salts. This method employs a copper&#8208;catalyzed process, characterized by mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and straightforward operational procedures. The method facilitates the efficient construction of substituted aminotriazoles through both stepwise and one&#8208;pot syntheses. The practical synthesis of triazolyliodonium salts as stable solids is expected to enable further derivatizations.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in&#8197;situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8722;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.

         <title>Elucidating Fluorine Steering Effects in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions Interfaced with Charge&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated molecules are core to contemporary drug discovery programs and critical for advancing innovation in numerous fields. In merging these important chemical themes, fluorinated Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition products are a particularly attractive subset of compounds with significant utility. Herein, an in&#8208;depth computational and experimental study of fluorine substitution effects on dienophile partners in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is reported. Of particular focus to this study is understanding the origin of reaction rate deceleration as a consequence of employing fluorinated dienophiles and the factors controlling endo&#8208; vs. exo&#8208;selectivity. To unlock insight into this unique reactivity, density function theory calculations, distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain models, energy decomposition analysis and natural bond orbital analysis, among other computational methods, were applied. In addition, the influence of oriented external&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;effects (OEEFs) and local electric field effects were explored. To further probe this effect, experimental studies of charge&#8208;enhanced Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity with fluorinated dienophiles were conducted. Collectively, this work offers novel mechanistic understanding pertinent to Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of fluorinated dienophiles providing valuable fluorinated scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfones from Substituted Alkenes via Molybdooxaziridine Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the MoO2Dipic promoted sulfonation of alkenes using N&#8208;Ts&#8208;hydroxylamine as the quantitative source of Ts. The reaction works with high yields and stereoselectivities for styrenes with a wide variety of substitution patterns. A novel atom transfer radical addition mechanism involving the formation of molybdooxaziridine complex 1 as the active catalyst, difunctionalization with Ts&#8208;NO, followed by oxidation, and then elimination as the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step for the formation of vinylsulfone 3 has been proposed. Initial kinetic and mechanistic data indicates the formation of Ts&#8208;NO and provides evidence for the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Entry to Novel Aminoindolizidines with Fused Furan, Thiophene, and Pyrrole Ring Starting from L&#8208;Glutamic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel optically pure aminoindolizidines featuring fused tetrahydro&#8208;furan, thiophene, or pyrrole ring were synthesized from the proteinogenic L&#8208;glutamic acid as a chiral precursor and a nitrogen atom source. The synthetic sequence employed tricyclic indolizidinols as advanced building blocks, which were prepared on a gram&#8208;scale from bioavailable reagents. Key transformations within the used synthetic sequence included diastereoselective Thompson azidation, Staudinger reduction, Jurjew reaction, and highly diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. These steps facilitated the efficient and stereoselective synthesis of the ultimate amino&#8208; and N&#8208;acetylamino&#8208;indolizidines.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoid Carbene Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Traditional methods for synthesizing these bonds often rely on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Ullmann reactions, which have limitations, including the requirement for elevated temperature and basic conditions. In recent years, diazo quinones have emerged as promising reagents for C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bond formation due to their unique structural and reactive properties, which include high electrophilicity and a tendency toward aromatization. This review highlights recent advances in the use of quinoid carbenes, derived from diazo quinones, for the construction of C(sp2)&#8208;N, C(sp2)&#8208;O, and C(sp2)&#8208;S bonds. Key methodologies discussed include rhodium&#8208;, iridium&#8208;, ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, heteroatom&#8208;H bond insertion reactions, migration reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. These methods offer mild, functional group&#8208;tolerant alternatives to traditional approaches, showcasing their utility in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules, medicinally relevant compounds, and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Modular Synthesis of Thioacetals by Using Dichloromethane as the C1 Synthon under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioacetals are an important category of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds and versatile building blocks. Therefore, there is growing demand for the development of practical and modular methods to access various thioacetals from inexpensive and readily available commodity chemicals. Herein, we describe a novel one&#8208;pot multicomponent protocol for thioacetals synthesis, especially benzylthio thioacetals synthesis, by employing feedstock chemical dichloromethane (DCM) as the C1 source under metal&#8208;free, mild and simple conditions. Furthermore, its synthetic utility is further demonstrated by the preparation of deuterated thioacetals, large&#8208;scale synthesis and broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the dual roles of DBU as both a proton scavenger and a nucleophilic catalyst. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosyl esters as stable donors in chemical glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient glycosylation methods are continuously being developed to obtain homogeneously pure carbohydrates to study their biological roles. The development of effective and stereoselective glycosylations using novel anomeric leaving groups constitutes an active area of research in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Although various glycosyl donors have been developed over the decades, anomeric esters as donors in glycosylation have received significant attention in recent times due to their convenience of preparation, shelf stability, catalytic activation, mild conditions, and high glycosylation efficiency. We focus in this mini&#8208;review on covering the glycosyl ester&#8208;containing donors utilized in chemical glycosylation methods, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters in glycoside synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Greening the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofuran Selenides: I2/TBHP&#8208;Promoted Selenocyclization of 2&#8208;Allylphenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we describe the synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing dihydrobenzofurans through the selenocyclization reaction of 2&#8208;allylphenols. The reaction procedure uses only an I2/TBHP oxidant system at room temperature, enabling an efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. The products are formed immediately after the addition of the oxidant system in a mixture of 2&#8208;allylphenol and diorganyl diselenide, in the absence of solvent, at mild experimental conditions. Furthermore, control experiments were carried out, including 77Se NMR analyses to identify intermediates, which contributed to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Direct Synthesis of Secondary Amides and Nitriles Using O&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating agent, O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine (PymONHBoc), has been designed and synthesized, from readily available 2&#8208;chloropyrimidine. This reagent demonstrates superior shelf stability and ease of handling compared to other hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents. Here, we present a metal&#8208;free method for the direct conversion of ketones and aldehydes into sec&#8208;amides and nitriles using PymONHBoc as the aminating agent. This method efficiently converts a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds into the corresponding amides and nitriles with good to excellent yields under ambient conditions. The use of PymONHBoc is advantageous, as it facilitates the in situ generation of the activated oxime intermediate, concomitantly producing a non&#8208;interfering byproduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs2CO3&#8208;I2 Promoted Efficient Synthesis of Flavones and Flavanones: Total Synthesis of Narengenin and Apigenin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are an important class of naturally existing scaffolds known for their diverse biological activities and have been immensely synthesized using stoichiometric reagent amounts. Herein, we report a reliable, robust, one&#8208;pot, transition metal and additive&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of flavones and flavanones from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and substituted aldehydes. Our developed method utilizes Cs2CO3 as a base and iodine as an oxidant in H2O: DMSO (9:1) solvent system, which provides direct access to many flavones and flavanones in excellent yields under milder reaction conditions with simple yet easily available substrates. In application, naturally occurring compounds such as naringenin and apigenin have been successfully synthesized using developed protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Photoelectrochemical&#8208; Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Aldehydes to Acyl Radicals and Their Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from aldehydes to acyl radicals and their transformations are presented with mechanistic insights. This review focuses on recent advances, showcasing the potential and delivering different modes of reactivity of acyl radicals as well as future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactivity. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes to acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss the important advancements in the past 6&#8197;years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their applications in organic synthesis. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.

         <title>Case studies of dimensionality in chemical data</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambition to relate intrinsic features of chemical data to the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is not new, but has experienced only modest success. This may partly be attributed to a lack of theoretical groundwork connecting idealized theory to actual experimental data with added complexity. In particular: i) many CRNs have species that cannot be directly observed experimentally; ii) the apparent number of underlying reactions is a function of the resolution of the data; iii) chemical phenomena can change the number of discernable independent processes of the data. In this work, we illustrate the application of the recently introduced concept of data dimension, which quantifies the linearly independent dimensions the system composition in a CRN can change. We perform case studies inspecting the dimensionality of chemical data characterizing CRNs, and outline how it can be used for mechanistic interpretation. In some instances, these extended considerations allow us to directly recover the CRN proposed in the literature without any fitting. This demonstrates that, with incomplete information, important clues about CRN structure can still be recovered. Additionally, our approach detects critical subtleties, preventing important candidate reactions from being discarded in mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A straightforward metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free iodine&#8208;dependent green protocol of chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin/4&#8208;phenylamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208; substituted&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed at room temperature and ambient air in green solvent PEG&#8208;400.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly approach for the C3&#8208;H regioselective chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed by using diphenyl dichalcogenides and iodine as support in green solvent PEG&#8208;400 under ambient temperature and aerobic condition. Furthermore, chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone has also been accomplished in similar conditions. The proposed mechanism is based on the control experiments and suggests an ionic pathway. The reaction offers a green synthetic path with a high yield, and the methodology is crucially significant due to its operational simplicity, convenient execution, scalability, and tolerance of various functional groups.

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Juncus acutus&#160;is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Tetracyclic Heteroarenes via Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Ethynylbiaryl Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic heteroarenes that contain internal thiophene, furan and pyrrole rings are well&#8208;documented materials due to their presence in fossil fuels and their importance in organic optoelectronic applications. Accordingly, a variety of methods are available for their synthesis. In this report we prepared naphthannulated 4&#8208;membered heteroarene isomers through the PtCl2&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo cyclization of ethynylbiaryls. Isomers were accessible from two structurally different precursors that contained the ethynyl subunit in different positions. We synthesized two pairs of thiophene&#8208;based ethynylbiaryls where each pair would lead to the same tetracyclic isomer and explored their reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformation. The formation of a detectable amount of inseparable side&#8208;product was observed when the alkyne was introduced onto the benzene ring of the biaryls. This is suggested to be an exo&#8208;methylene group containing derivative that forms via a 5&#8208;exo cyclization pathway. Similarly, naphthannulated benzofuran isomers were prepared following the same strategy and an exo&#8208;methylene&#8208;containing side product was observed when the alkyne unit was on the benzene ring of the biaryl. Finally, novel synthesis methods were described for benzo&#8208;fused carbazoles from ethynylbiaryls containing an alkyne either on the heterocyclic ring or on the phenyl substituent attached to the indole ring. No side&#8208;product formation was detected in this case.</dc:description>

         <title>An efficient synthetic methodology for the preparation of glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present a synthetic methodology for preparing glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl ethers. The process involves three steps: nitrile oxide cycloadditions, reduction of the glycosyl isoxazolines, and oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions were conducted with retention of the anomeric configuration. The resulting glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones were then utilized in the synthesis of the corresponding pyrazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective synthesis of cyclic dithiocarbonates using bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as multifunctional catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic dithiocarbonates of the type 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione were selectively and efficiently produced from the reaction between epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts &#160;as catalysts. We have designed and synthesized three nucleophilic catalysts from the neutral forms of bis&#8208;benzimidazole compounds (BBE&#8208;Me, BBE&#8208;H and BBE&#8208;NO2), through simple procedures. All three catalysts, with aryl substituents possessing different electronic characteristics, were able to selectively catalyze the production of cyclic dithiocarbonates. BBE&#8208;Me proved to be the most effective catalyst in the initial screening with 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenoxypropane, converting 95% of the epoxide with 99% of selectivity for the cyclic dithiocarbonate 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione. This catalyst was subsequently used to evaluate various reaction parameters and then several epoxides were selectively converted to the respective cyclic dithiocarbonates, under mild conditions, with a low catalyst loading, short reaction times, and in a solvent&#8208; and additive&#8208;free system. A mechanistic proposal, supported by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, demonstrated for the first time that a nucleophilic catalyst in this system can simultaneously activate both CS2 and the epoxide molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed intramolecular hydroamination reaction of homopropargyl N&#8208;tosyl amides to produce synthetically useful substituted &#947;&#8208;lactams through the corresponding alkynyl phenyl selenide intermediates. Our focus on optimising the cyclisation protocol under flow conditions has led to a significant enhancement in efficiency, thereby reducing the time and resources required for the process.

Our focus on optimising the cyclisation protocol under flow conditions has led to a significant enhancement in efficiency, thereby reducing the time and resources required for the process. DFT calculations of the reaction mechanism for the catalytic transformation of a model alkynyl phenyl selenide were also conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Chalcogenation of Amino Acids/Peptides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids are building blocks of biomacromolecules proteins and peptides, which are essential for living organisms. Recently, structurally modified amino acids and their peptides have received high demand for the development of various types of biomaterials, including therapeutic drug candidates. For example, the chalcogenated amino acids and their peptides serve as privileged structural scaffolds, derived from native amino acids. Given the widespread utility of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds in biological, pharmaceutical, and medicinal chemistry, efficient chalcogenation protocol has been accomplished through various catalytic methods such as transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic strategies. Among them, transition&#8208;metal based strategies through C&#8208;H activation have been extensively explored for the chalcogenation of amino acids and peptides. Concurrently, metal&#8208;free and photocatalytic strategies offer sustainable and step&#8208;economically viable pathways for achieving successful chalcogenation. In this review, we have focused on the recent achievements of both C(sp2)&#8208;H and C(sp3)&#8208;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides with chalcogenides along with their substrate scopes, mechanisms, advantages, and limitations.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this investigation, we elucidated, one&#8208;pot two stage efficient synthesis of multifuctionalized spiro[oxindole &#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine]. The methodology proceeds via organocatalyzed nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction between indolylidenecyanoesters and nitroalkanes to formed nitro&#8208;Michael adduct which transformed into multifunctionalized 3,3'&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles by metal catalyzed reductive cyclization cascade. DFT investigations were conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the preferential reduction of the nitro group, with subsequent attack on the nitrile and ester groups remain inert throughout the reaction process. The approach is operationally simple, easily scalable, exhibits compatibility with readily accessible starting material and catalysts, thereby emphasizing cost&#8208;effectiveness.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent decades have witnessed considerable progress in the development of fluorinated&#8208;building&#8208;block strategies and direct&#8208;fluorination techniques selectively affording allylic monofluorides and gem&#8208;difluorides. For allylic monofluorides, high enantioselectivities were achieved, even for fluorinated tertiary carbons, with expanded substitution patterns on vinylic moieties enabling precise control over di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted fluorides. Advances in defluorofunctionalization and direct C&#8211;H fluorination have addressed the limitations of raw materials and made these species more accessible. Additionally, considerable progress has been achieved in the related photoredox reactions, and electrochemistry has emerged as a valuable tool for allylic fluoride synthesis.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Construction of Axially Chiral Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral carbonyl compounds are widespread in biologically active compounds and are useful chiral ligands or organocatalysts in asymmetric catalysis. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches have become powerful tools for constructing axially chiral carbonyl compounds, offering high efficiency, selectivity, and versatility. This concept aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carbonyl compounds. According to the reaction mode, the discussion is mainly divided into four categories: cross&#8208;coupling reactions, cycloaddition reactions, desymmetrization reactions, and other C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of axially chiral carbonyl compounds has attracted considerable interest in organic synthesis due to their prevalence in natural products and pharmaceuticals, as well as their utility in material science and catalysis. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches have become powerful tools for their construction, offering high efficiency, selectivity, and versatility among the various methods developed. This concept aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carbonyl compounds, integrating scattered work with different catalytic systems. This feature concept is divided into four types of reactions based on the strategies employed: cross&#8208;coupling reactions, cycloaddition reactions, desymmetrization reactions, and other C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of SulfoCy5&#8208; and SulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>

Chemical synthesis of sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer as probes to unravel the mechanism of action of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates, such as antigen&#8208;&#945;GalCer synthetic vaccines, and to understand the fate of their components. Herein we present the synthesis and formulation in liposomes of sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer probes, followed by cellular uptake and confocal microscopy uptake experiment in a murine dendritic cell line.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8208;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8208;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8208;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8208;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.

Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5-&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer-antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Pyrazolato Complex Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Alkylation of Ketones and Arylacetonitriles with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(III)&#8208;pyrazolato complex effectively catalyzed the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols and borrowing hydrogen strategy was employed. The same catalyst was utilized to synthesize quinolines from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohols and ketones through dehydrogenative coupling.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of an air&#8208;stable iridium pyrazolato complex as an effective catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols, employing borrowing hydrogen strategy. The alkylation reactions were efficiently conducted at 120&#8201;&#176;C in toluene utilizing a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). A broad range of ketones and arylacetonitriles, in combination with various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols, were successfully transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkylated products. Additionally, quinoline derivatives were synthesized from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol and ketones using dehydrogenative coupling strategy. A mechanistic investigation unveiled that the key step involved alcohol activation via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

         <title>A Direct Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Coupling Of Azaarenes with Diversely Functionalized Alkyl Carbons via Organophotocatalytic Sp3C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient visible&#8208;light catalytic regioselective functionalization of azaaryl compounds through direct sp2C&#8722;sp3C coupling between different azaaryl systems and diverse alcohols, ethers, alkyl halides, and alkyl chains has been reported. This organophotocatalytic coupling uses blue LEDs for the generation of reactive nucleophilic radicals on saturated carbons, which instantaneously undergo regioselective coupling with azaarenes through Minisci&#8208;type coupling to generate an array of important pharmacophores.







Abstract
Substituted azaarenes are one of the most ubiquitous moieties in natural products and drug molecules. An efficient organophotocatalytic method for direct coupling of diverse cyclic and acyclic alkyl carbons of alcohols, ethers, alkyl halides and alkanes with different azaaryl systems has been developed. It uses low loading of easily synthesizable efficient acridinium based photocatalyst and blue LED to generate highly reactive radicals on saturated hydrocarbons through sequential single electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. These in&#8197;situ generated nucleophilic carbon radicals then undergo instantaneous regio&#8208;selective coupling with azaarenes through Minisci type coupling to generate an array of important pharmacophores through sp2C&#8722;sp3C bond formation. With inexpensive organophotocatalysts, higher yield and wide substrate scope, this method provides a greener, efficient and versatile alternative to the previously reported syntheses.

         <dc:description>
A general methodology for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction of cycloenones and a variety of di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds. The methodology involves the use of a bifunctional Lewis base as catalyst in aqueous medium at room temperature. The synthetic applicability of the polyfunctionalized MBH adducts is demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.







Abstract
In this report, we present an extensive methodological study of the aqueous Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of a range of cycloenones with di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto esters, 1,2&#8208;diketones, diethyl ketomalonate, ninhydrin, acenaphthenequinone, and phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, through mediation of a bicyclic imidazolyl alcohol (BIA) as catalyst in aqueous medium. The desired MBH adducts were obtained in up to 98&#8201;% yield. The synthetic applicability of the MBH adducts was demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Chemoselective Reductive Cyclization: Synthesis of Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Thioxanthenes and 10&#8208;Methyl 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines and Beyond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;thioxanthenes are synthesized directly via In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization reaction passes via highly chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion by the intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent). N&#8208;Methyl 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines are also synthesized under a Bronsted acid catalyzed reductive cyclization in isopropyl alcohol.







Abstract
Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;thioxanthenes are obtained from 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes via In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization in diisopropyl ether at elevated temperature. The reaction possesses broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility and proceeds via chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion in the presence of a highly reactive arylaldehyde. Similarly, unsubstituted 10&#8208;methyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines are also obtained via a Bronsted acid catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;(methylphenylamino)benzaldehydes in isopropanol (solvent). The reductive cyclization method can also be utilized for the synthesis of 9&#8208;trifluormethyl containing (thio)xanthenes. Mono&#8208;deuterated 9H&#8208;thioxanthene is obtained in moderate yield in deuterated solvent (THF&#8208;d8).

     alt="Expanding the Scope of Chemoselective Reductive Cyclization: Synthesis of Unsubstituted 9H-Thioxanthenes and 10-Methyl 9,10-Dihydroacridines and Beyond"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsubstituted 9H-thioxanthenes are synthesized directly via In(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2-(arylthio)benzaldehydes in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization reaction passes via highly chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion by the intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent). N-Methyl 9,10-dihydroacridines are also synthesized under a Bronsted acid catalyzed reductive cyclization in isopropyl alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsubstituted 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthenes are obtained from 2-(arylthio)benzaldehydes via In(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization in diisopropyl ether at elevated temperature. The reaction possesses broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility and proceeds via chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion in the presence of a highly reactive arylaldehyde. Similarly, unsubstituted 10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridines are also obtained via a Bronsted acid catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization of 2-(methylphenylamino)benzaldehydes in isopropanol (solvent). The reductive cyclization method can also be utilized for the synthesis of 9-trifluormethyl containing (thio)xanthenes. Mono-deuterated 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthene is obtained in moderate yield in deuterated solvent (THF-d8).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Hydrazono&#8208;3&#8208;Thiazolines from 2&#8208;Substituted Oxazoles through a One&#8208;Pot Multicomponent/Rearrangement Process</title>

         <dc:description>
The first rearrangement of an oxazole nucleus to a thiazoline ring was achieved under mild conditions through a multicomponent reaction featuring 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxazoles, thiosemicarbazide, and a carbonyl compound to provide isothiosemicarbazones, which undergo oxazole ring&#8208;opening and recyclization to functionalized 2&#8208;hydrazono&#8208;3&#8208;thiazolines (34&#8211;98&#8201;% yield) in a chemo&#8208; and stereoselective manner.







Abstract
The serendipitous rearrangement of an oxazole nucleus to a thiazoline ring under mild conditions is described. This transformation was achieved by a multicomponent reaction (MCR) featuring 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxazoles, thiosemicarbazide, and a carbonyl compound to provide oxazole&#8208;derived isothiosemicarbazones, which undergo oxazole ring&#8208;opening and recyclization to 2&#8208;hydrazono&#8208;3&#8208;thiazolines in a one&#8208;pot procedure. This straightforward route produced highly functionalized thiazolines (34&#8211;98&#8201;% yield) in a chemo&#8208; and stereoselective manner.

         <dc:description>
A series of spiroindolines were synthesized by carbene&#8208;triggered 1,2&#8208;acyloxy migration&#8208;cyclization cascade reaction. This protocol presents a novel and efficient approach for constructing potentially valuable [6,5,5,6]&#8208; and [6,5,6,6]&#8208;tetracyclic spiroindolines in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.

A photocatalyst&#8208;free visible&#8208;light induced radical difluoromethylation approach for the convenient synthesis of difluoromethylated oxindoles from N&#8208;arylacrylamides with difluoromethyl phenoxathiinium salt (PT&#8208;CF2H+BF4&#8722;) was achieved. This transformation involves radical difluoromethylation/cyclization cascade process and features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope and good functional groups tolerance. Using this method, a wide range of difluoromethyl&#8208;modified oxindoles was successfully synthesized in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides and Impact of the Fluorinated Group on the Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides was developed using an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid and various amines. A 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be transformed into two additional SF5&#8208;containing building blocks, a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and an oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with isolated yields going from 43&#8201;% to quantitative. We showed that a 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles.

         <title>DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Isoxazolone&#8208;Based Bisspiroheterocyclic Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines is reported, which provides an efficient access to spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazolone derivatives bearing CF3 group and quaternary carbon stereocenters in good to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A strategic approach to incorporate CF3 group into oxindoles, pyrrolidines, and isoxazolones to construct spiro heterocyclic skeletons with quaternary carbon stereocenters was developed. Using a DMAP catalyst under mild conditions, the controllable synthesis of spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazoline derivatives was achieved via concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines. This method exhibits robust regioselectivity and provides a series of isoxazolone&#8208;based bispiro heterocycles in good to high yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (in all cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), offering new candidate compounds for drug screen.

         <title>Toward Multi&#8208;Functionalized Organogermaniums: Diastereoselective Transformations of Germacycles Derived from Cheletropic Reactions of Boron&#8208;Substituted Butadienes with Ge(II) Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (4+1) cycloadditions of the boron&#8208;substituted butadienes with Ge(II) salts afforded the carbon&#8208;based germacycles. The obtained germacycles behaved as allylboronic nucleophiles and were applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enabled access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.







Abstract
The field of organogermanium in chemistry has recently attracted attention. Thanks to the inherent features of germanium (Ge), introducing Ge&#8208;based substituents into organic frameworks has enhanced bioactivity and optoelectronic properties of molecules. Herein, the synthesis of multi&#8208;functionalized organogermaniums using Ge(II) salts is reported. The germacycles having an allylboron moiety, which is derived from the (4+1) cycloadditions of the butadienes bearing a boronic ester moiety with Ge(II) salts, can be applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enable access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.

         <title>The Catalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Aryl Acetic Acids by Late&#8208;Stage Bromination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;bromination of aryl acetic acids via an enediolate intermediate is presented. This method yields a variety of aryl acetic acids with yields ranging from 19&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%, including three examples of dibrominated products. Furthermore, the reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale, and several transformations of the resulting products have been performed.







Abstract
We report a catalytic late&#8208;stage bromination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl acetic acid. The aryl acetic acid was transformed into enediolate in the presence of an (AcO)4B2O with the combination of DBU, and consequently underwent an electrophilic bromination reaction with pyridinium tribromide. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;bromo aryl acetic acids were isolated in yields of 19&#8211;65&#8201;%. In addition, the reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and several transformations of the products were carried out.

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3&#8242;&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8722;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions with unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamine&#8208;TfOH were successfully achieved. This mechanochemical organocatalysis featured with high efficiency, atom economy, solvent&#8208;free catalysis and high stereoselectivity Furthermore, unreactive substrates, which could not be promoted in solution, could proceed smoothly under ball&#8208;milling conditions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, chiral 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this mechanochemical asymmetric catalytic protocol and afforded high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.

A mild radical two/three&#8208;component cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes to access difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl dioxodibenzothiazepines or dibenzazepines with good selectivity/substrate scopes.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent Thiazole Fused Benzo[a] Carbazoles by Sunlight Driven Photocyclization of Indolylthiazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles has been reported for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles. The Key features of this method include the use of sun light as the source of energy, catalyst&#8208;free conditions and presence of medicinally important thiazole and carbazole moieties. Most of these synthesized products show very good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time a sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles, for the synthesis of highly fluorescent thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles using a mixture of solvents (CH3CN: DMSO; 3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Ring opening of indole moiety was observed in the case of thiazole derivatives having 2&#8208;methyl indole substituents. Under similar reaction conditions, photocyclization of trisubstituted thiazoles having cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls in place of indole moiety also worked. This reaction provides products having two medicinally important moieties thiazole and benzocarbazoles. We have studied the photophysical properties of all the products and found that most of the synthesized products have very good fluorescence quantum yields.

         <title>Practicable Syntheses of Electroluminescent Ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifluorenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent organic molecules have been proffered as the key to unlocking a new generation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The article describes our development of a practicable library synthesis of a class of electroluminescent materials with a bifluorene core. The approach is applicable to an array of related materials containing a photoluminescent core tethered to heteroaromatic salts by alkyl chains.







Abstract
The development of a practicable library synthesis of ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifluorenes is described that improves the safety and reduces waste associated with the ubiquitous method of preparing these and related electroluminescent compounds. Additionally, an X&#8208;ray crystal structure that reveals how triflate counterions can provide a second link between the alkylimidazolium subunits and the photoluminescent core is presented.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Ketones and Aldimines with Ammonia Borane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The earth&#8208;abundant 3&#8197;d metal catalysts have been widely used in organic transformation due to their low toxicity and unique catalytic characteristics. Herein, we reported the easily synthesized &#945;&#8208;diimine cobalt complex that exhibited good catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldimines with ammonia&#8208;borane as hydrogen source under mild conditions.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenation of organic compounds employing low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalysts is highly desirable as the corresponding hydrogenated products have significant importance in pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industries. Herein, a cobalt(II) complex supported by &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand has been easily prepared by treatment of anhydrous CoCl2 with diimine, which can catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated bond with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. A variety of ketones and aldimines bearing diverse functional groups can be reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines in moderate to excellent yields at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that several readily reducible functional groups such as nitro and cyano are tolerated under the standard reaction conditions. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reaction has been successfully carried out and the procedure could be handled easily, which both make this methodology general and practical.

         <title>Hydrazone Based pH&#8208;Responsive Configurational Molecular Rotary Switches Containing a New Conjugated &#960;&#8208;Electronic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocyclic scaffold derived hydrazone&#8208;based molecule was explored as a pH&#8208;activated molecular switch. It undergoes hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization, followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization to show switching properties.







Abstract
A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocycle derived pH&#8208;activated, hydrazone based molecular switch and its switching mechanism are reported here. The introduction of a new conjugated &#960; electronic framework (enone part in the molecule) allowed the system to undergo hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization, followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization through rotation around the partial C&#8722;N single bond. Under acidic pH, protonation took place selectively on pyrimidinone nitrogen, and that turned the molecule to the corresponding ZH+ configuration. On the other hand, addition of triethylamine in the same solution reverted the molecule back to its original E&#8208;configuration. Extensive proton&#8208;NMR, and detailed X&#8208;ray crystallography coupled with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were carried out to establish the switching phenomena. Theoretical DFT calculations leading to free energy diagrams, transition states, and intermediates shed light on the mechanism behind the switching phenomenon.

Amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} is used as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines with an excellent yield of corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions yielding the corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines after aqueous work. Solid amidophosphine boranes, which are easy to synthesize, and easy to handle demonstrated excellent reactivity and functional group tolerance toward a wide variety of ketones and imines, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substitutions, thus showing excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8211;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides with allylic sulfones, facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. The reaction is characterized by base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a wide range of substrate compatibility, and high tolerance for functional groups. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate that the allylation process proceeds via a radical intermediate.







Abstract
Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8211;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8211;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.

         <title>Electrochemical Domino Sulfonylation/Dearomative ipso&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Biaryls to Access Spiro(indenyl)cyclohexadienones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, metal&#8208;free and external oxidant&#8208;free method is described for the synthesis of sulfonylated indenyl&#8208;spirocyclohexadienones under electrochemical conditions via radical&#8208;promoted ipso&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls.







Abstract
Herein, we present an efficient strategy for the synthesis of spiro(indenyl)cyclohexadienones through radical&#8208;promoted reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls with sodium sulfinates under electrochemical conditions. The reaction involves sulfonylation and dearomative ipso&#8208;cyclisation in a domino fashion. This approach features the use of readily accessible precursors, wide functional group tolerance and external oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions. The practicality of the method was also illustrated by scale&#8208;up reaction and further diversification of the product.

         <title>Syntheses and Properties of Two Isomeric Phenanthroacephenanthrylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the syntheses and properties of two phenanthroacephenanthrylene regioisomers as the new non&#8208;alternant cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic analogs of alternant dibenzoperylene polyaromatics.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.

         <title>A Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline&#8208;Mediated Direct Asymmetric Aldol Addition in the Presence of Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
trans&#8208;4&#8208;squaramide&#8208;tagged proline 2 mediated a direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. In a departure from results observed with previous catalysts of similar design, 2 proved more efficient to its cis&#8208;counterpart, suggesting factors other than hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at play. The catalyst also mediated an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones by the same transformation.







Abstract
A squaramide moiety introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline produced an organocatalyst that promoted the direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. A variety of aldol adducts, majorly from the reaction cyclohexanone with aldehydes, were obtained in yields generally in the range of 53&#8211;99&#8201;%, accompanied by 71&#8211;99&#8201;% ee and 83&#8201;:&#8201;17 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratios. An asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.

A highly efficient N&#8208;heterocycle assembly method for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols by acceptorless dehydrogenation has been developed. This method can be applied for the synthesis of two kinds of N&#8208;heterocycles (over 40 examples) in up to 86&#8201;% yield, which showcases the general, practical, and mild features of this chromium&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
A novel and highly efficient method for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols has been established. Using an Earth&#8208;abundant and air&#8208;stable chromium salt catalyst and a phosphine&#8208;free ligand, the developed Cr&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling provides 1,3,5&#8208;triazines and pyrimidines with high yields and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the synthetic value of this operationally simple protocol was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiment and the synthesis of the linker to construct various supramolecular complexes.

         <title>Sequential Aerial Oxidation and Atom&#8208;Economical C&#8208;3 Chalcogenation of Indolines Facilitated by Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative and atom economic chalocogenation of indolines was achieved using potassium tert&#8208;butoxide assisted strategy, yielding C&#8208;3 chalcogenated indole derivatives with good anti&#8208;cancer activity against MDA&#8208;MB 231 and MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines. The process endorsed greener approach with air as the oxidant under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
An operationally straightforward and highly efficient potassium tert&#8208;butoxide facilitated protocol for the C&#8208;3 chalcogenation of indolines under catalyst and additive&#8208;free conditions has been established under ambient temperature. The salient features of the process include the development of transition metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free and iodine&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economic and cost&#8208;effective reaction conditions at room temperature in DMSO as solvent for regioselective generation of 3&#8208;chalcogenyl indoles in high yields. The mechanistic interpretation through controlled experiments and analysis of intermediates suggests the prevalence of the ionic pathway. The reaction is scalable to gram&#8208;scale without a significant decrease in product yield, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale applications. This protocol offers a practical and environment friendly approach to accessing a diverse range of 3&#8208;arylthioindoles and 3&#8208;arylselenylindoles withstanding electron releasing and withdrawing substituents in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the biological evaluation of the 3&#8208;arylselenylindole products exhibited significant activity against breast cancer and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines MCF&#8208;7, and MDA&#8208;MB 231. These results indicate the derivatives to be potent candidates for further SAR study.

The story of the bow and arrow is the story of the use of intelligence to precisely reach a target. In the Front Cover image, this is replaced with a light source generating visible blue light, which is precisely used to synthesise the target heterocyclic compounds. The photochemical organic reactions achieved by using metal photocatalysts, non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts, or even without photocatalysts reported in the Review by S. Nagarajan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202401195) are a story of the use of intelligence in organic chemistry.

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular electronics (moletronics) lead to ultimate miniaturization and excellent efficiencies that could replace contemporary silicon&#8208;based electronics or circuits in the near future. In this aspect, redox&#8208;based transformations or switching at single&#8208;molecule break junctions would be of epitome significance to reveal physicochemical phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Photochemical Reactions of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 48, December 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. This paper provides an overview of organic transformations achieved through metal and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts or even without the necessity of photocatalysts from 2019 to 2024.







Abstract
The adoption of clean and renewable light sources is becoming increasingly prevalent in organic synthesis due to their welfare, workability and economic benefits. In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. Since harmful or polluting reagents are not needed for the organic photochemical reactions, these reactions provide insights into sustainable processes and green chemistry. N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds (NHC's) constitute fundamental structural motifs in numerous organic compounds and are widely encountered in natural products and pharmaceuticals with diverse biological activities. Consequently, investigations into the synthesis and modification of these NHC's such as indole, carbazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline and pyridine hold particular significance for chemists and pharmacologists. This review provides an overview of the impact of photocatalysis on synthesis of NHC's and their modification from 2019 to 2024. These transformations are achieved through the utilization of both metal photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Ir, Pd, Co, Gd etc.) and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Eosin&#8208;Y, 4CzIPN, Mes&#8208;Acr+ClO4&#8722; etc.), or even without the necessity of photocatalysts. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers delving into the promising realm of photocatalyzed transformations.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic acetates and chlorohydrosilanes using nickel catalysts has been reported to produce a series of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
This paper introduces an innovative strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes via nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The approach utilizes propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to produce a variety of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are notably mild, and the process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, as well as an impressive substrate scope. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the use of chlorogermane and chlorostannane, facilitating the synthesis of germanium or stannium&#8208;substituted allenes.

     alt="Ni-Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross-Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductive cross-coupling of propargylic acetates and chlorohydrosilanes using nickel catalysts has been reported to produce a series of silyl-substituted allenes with high regioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces an innovative strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes via nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling reactions. The approach utilizes propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to produce a variety of silyl-substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are notably mild, and the process is characterized by high chemo- and regioselectivity, as well as an impressive substrate scope. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the use of chlorogermane and chlorostannane, facilitating the synthesis of germanium or stannium-substituted allenes. This research not only offers a valuable strategy for the preparation of multisubstituted allenes but also significantly broadens the synthetic repertoire for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Green Synthetic Approach to Construct C2&#8208;Quaternary Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones at Room Temperature via Regioselective Oxidative Dearomatization of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a novel and simple synthetic approach for producing diverse indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one using oxidant TBHP and In(OTf)3 catalyst at ambient temperature under solvent&#8208;free conditions, exhibiting regioselectivity and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A new synthetic strategy for the construction of C2&#8208;quaternary indole for the formation of Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has been explored via indium(III) trifluoromethansulphonate catalyst at room temperature with TBHP as a green oxidant in water. This approach for the oxidative dearomatization process allows for the production of the natural product Halichrome A and a broad range of C2&#8208;arylated Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under a milder condition in very good yields. The oxidative self&#8208;dimerization and self&#8208;trimerization of various indole derivatives have also been achieved under the same conditions.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of carbazole porphyrins in mixture of chloroform and methanol. In chloroform, porphyrins assembled into micro&#8208;belt superstructures, however, 90&#8201;% MeOH in chloroform resulted chiral helical microfibres of 1 and twisted helical ribbons of 2, respectively. The chiral superstructures utilizing the fundamental self&#8208;assembly principle, in which one directional growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of core of porphyrin along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain.







Abstract
Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.&#8201;e. 90&#8201;% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl Aldehydes: Multifaceted Versatile Building Blocks In Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack reaction is an important tool to synthesize &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehyde which is a ptential aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building block (AXB3). Multiple reactive sites and high reactivity of formyl group and vinylic/benzylic halogen makes them fast reacting electrophiles offering fertile land for diverse organic transformations. In this review, we have assembled all the contributions from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, addition&#8208;elimination reactions, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioselective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactive heterocycles by using various C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Chemoselective Enrichment of sp3 Character in Post&#8208;Ugi Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study aimed at reducing the degree of unsaturation and consequently increasing the sp3 character in post&#8208;Ugi morpholines is conducted. The scaffold assembly involves triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. Diastereoselective heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, combined with chemoselective amide reduction, enables the controlled modulation of the morpholine core&#8216;s rigidity.







Abstract
We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.

The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine-promoted 6-exo-dig umpolung oxa-Michael cyclization of Ugi-derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2-methylenemorpholin-3-one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post-Ugi scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Hydroxychalcogenation of Olefins with Disulfides/Thiols/Diselenides and H2O as Nucleophilic Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details a novel electrochemical approach for the oxychalcogenation of olefins, employing disulfides, thiols, or diselenides as chalcogen sources and water as the nucleophilic oxygen source.







Abstract
A direct electrochemical redox reaction of olefins and disulfides/thiols/diselenides without external oxidants has been developed, which includes the hydroxychalcogenation of olefins. This procedure exhibited good functional group tolerance, and a series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfide/&#946;&#8208;hydroxyselenide derivatives were obtained in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry were also conducted to elucidate the reaction process.

         <title>Strong Acid&#8208;Free Homogeneous Catalytic Systems for the Ester Products Synthesis by Alkenes Alkoxycarbonylation: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last 15&#8197;years publications on alkenes alkoxycarbonylation with alcohols and CO using homogeneous catalytic systems (based on Pd, Ru, Co, and Ni) in the absence of strong H&#8208;acids commonly used in these reactions were analyzed. As a result of these works, polyesters, monomers, and other valuable intermediates were obtained.







Abstract
Alkoxycarbonylation represents a method for the ester products synthesis from available reagents &#8211; unsaturated compounds, alcohols, and CO. The beginning of research on this reaction was laid in W. Reppe&#8217; works in 1953. In early works, halides and carbonyls of Co, Ni, Rh, and Ir were used as catalysts, and alkoxycarbonylation was often complicated by the unsaturated compounds hydroformylation or alcohol carbonylation. In recent decades, in the presence of the most active and selective Pd&#8208;phosphine systems with strong protonic acids, the products are typically only isomeric esters, which corresponds to the creating waste&#8208;free production principles. At present, a large&#8208;capacity synthesis process for methyl methacrylate, dubbed Alpha, is in operation, with the initial stage being ethylene methoxycarbonylation. In light of these developments, there is a growing interest among chemists and technologists in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation. The use of strong protonic acids as co&#8208;catalysts is essential for the formation of active catalytic complexes. However, these acids are highly corrosive and can cause the alkenes isomerisation. This review is devoted to the analysis of acid&#8208;free homogeneous Pd&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;catalysts employed in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation over the past 15&#8197;years. As a result, polymers, monomers and other valuable linear and branched esters were obtained.

         <title>From Enzyme Encapsulation to Environmental Solutions: Photostable Laccase in Dopc Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.







Abstract
Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post&#8208;irradiation compared to the free enzyme. In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, the simplicity and ease of large&#8208;scale production of multilamellar vesicles present an advantageous option for various applications, including bioremediation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable approach to the direct synthesis of thioesters has been developed using Fe3O4 as a low&#8208;cost, easily prepared, reusable and environmentally safe catalyst. The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoledione derivatives has been developed.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.

&lt;p&gt;A three-component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1-acryloyl-2-cyanoindoles with 4-alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rare Earth Metal Reagents in Organic Synthesis: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth elements, as an important part of the periodic table, not only represent a frontier area but also possess unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from those of main group elements and transition metals. Exploiting these unique characteristics to develop reaction systems not only holds profound academic value but also demonstrates extensive practical applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated organic synthesis has significantly advanced the field of synthetic chemistry over the decades. While transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions have become foundational, characterized by well&#8208;understood mechanisms like oxidative addition and reductive elimination, rare earth metals have not received as much attention. This review aims to highlight the synthetic applications of rare earth metals, fostering increased interest in their exploration. We discuss various reactions facilitated by these metals, including substitution, addition, insertion into unsaturated bonds, and coupling reactions, showcasing their unique capabilities and potential in modern synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;C3N4) as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst was developed for thiocyanation of alkenes under visible light irradiation with oxygen as green oxidant and without any other additives. The present protocol has excellent functional group tolerance and the desired tetrasubstituted alkenyl thiocyanides were obtained in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the recyclable mpg&#8208;C3N4 catalyst could be used at least 6&#8197;times without significant loss of activities.

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building blocks derived from tyrosine N&#8208;oxime have been used to construct natural products. We report the synthesis of nine halogenated tyrosine N&#8208;oxime derivatives reminiscent of biosynthetic precursors. Full conversion was ensured by the addition of p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TsOH) for monohalogenation and a key oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence using excess N&#8208;bromo, N&#8208;chloro, or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NBS, NCS, NIS) to provide dihalogenated derivatives.







Abstract
Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71&#8201;%, 50&#8211;53&#8201;%, and 78&#8211;80&#8201;% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8211;76&#8201;%, 54&#8211;56&#8201;%, 79&#8211;80&#8201;%). This strategy was extended to synthesize hetero&#8208;dihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8211;77&#8201;%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Hydroxylation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids. This review summarizes the representative methods over the past decade. The paper categorizes these methods based on the types of catalysts employed, encompassing a range of metal catalysts and non&#8208;metal catalysts, as well as other reaction types of catalyst&#8208;free.







Abstract
Hydroxylated compounds represent a significant and diverse class of substances in the field of chemistry. These compounds play critical roles in various chemical reactions and are essential components in numerous industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds, especially those derived from boronic acids. The synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids typically involves the utilization of various types of catalysts, which are essential for enhancing reaction rates and selectivity, including metal catalysts such as CuFe&#8322;O&#8324;, Cu@C&#8323;N&#8324;, AgNPs, and Ti0.97Ni0.3O1.97, as well as non&#8208;metal catalysts like polycaprolactone (PCL), TFB&#8208;BMTH COF materials, C70, and graphene oxide (GO). These catalytic reactions often require the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) or molecular oxygen, which serve as critical reagents in the hydroxylation process. In certain cases, organic bases act as electron donors to propel the reaction. Furthermore, some studies have reported oxidative hydroxylation reactions that are catalyst&#8208;free.This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and breakthroughs in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids, with a particular focus on research conducted from 2014 to 2024.

         <title>Photoinduced Gem&#8208;Difluoroallylic Ketones Formation via Selective Carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) Bond Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;Ketone Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

         <title>S&#8208;Nucleophilic Imidazoline Ring Expansion: a Novel Approach to the Formation of Medium&#8208;Sized Thiolactames</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the formation of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles with a thioamide moiety has been developed. This is based on the expansion reaction of the imidazole ring under the action of an S&#8208;nucleophile.







Abstract
A novel method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles containing thioamide groups. This approach facilitates the expansion of the imidazoline moiety within the condensed ring system through the action of S&#8208;nucleophiles, enabling access to a broader and more diverse chemical space for natural product analogs and bioactive compounds. A series of [1,4,7]thia&#8208;(oxa&#8722;)diazecin&#8208;9&#8208;thiones were efficiently synthesized from diarene&#8208;fused [1.4]heteroazepines using this transformation, achieving yields ranging from 28&#8211;58&#8201;%.

We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent. The direct amidation of esters with amines and t&#8208;BuMgCl generates the intermediate amides. Subsequently, without the need for isolation or purification, these intermediates reacted with Red&#8208;Al in the same reaction flask to generate amines up to 90&#8201;% yield. This process is characterized by the rapid reaction time, quantitative conversion, and broad ester scope with various functional groups. Notably, this method enables the successful transformation of amine with carboxylic esters to produce cariprazine, a pivotal antipsychotic drug substance.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescence active ligand system consisting of a BODIPY derivative, linked to a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl coordinating moiety via alkyl or benzyl spacers, is presented. The designed ligands exhibit remarkable emission properties even in solid state, which is complemented by crystal structure analysis. This enables future application of the ligands in various fields of coordination chemistry including spin&#8208;crossover photoluminescence coupled systems.







Abstract
Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8211;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n=1&#8211;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions. Photophysical studies revealed high fluorescence quantum yields (69 &#8211; 95&#8201;%) in solution for the &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208; bridged ligand 3 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) and the &#8208;(CH2)3&#8208; bridged ligand 4 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene). Non&#8208;radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208; and/or &#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208; moiety for 2 and 1 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[4&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)phenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety and a spacer in meso&#8208;position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first total synthesis of a glycolipid, deinococcucin A, isolated from a gut bacterium, member of extremophilic Deinococcus family. The synthesis started from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, a sugar arising from chitin biomass, major constituent of crustacean's shell. The major difficulty was the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide moiety linked in alpha anomeric position of GlcNAc, which was efficiently obtained from the corresponding allyl group.







Abstract
Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>
Phenyl, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) fragments are assembled around a central porphyrin core and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve the merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing optical features.







Abstract
A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dioxane as Precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;: A Simple and Convenient Strategy to Synthesize 1,2&#8208;Disulfide Substituted Ethanes Initiated by Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved via the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4&#8208;dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane generated in&#8208;situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented I2&#8208;initiated nucleophilic ring opening reaction of 1,4&#8208;dioxane with thiols for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes has been developed. Previously, dihalogenated ethane, acetylene or ethylene are often used as the pre&#8208;cursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;. Through the cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, 1,4&#8208;dioxane as precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved for the first time. In the presence of HI, thiols could be replaced by disulfides as nucleophile. This protocol is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

         <title>Exploring the reactivity of (hetero)aryl amides in the Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction with arylalkenyl boron reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides is explored in the formation of a C&#8211;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides. The products obtained were applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via Heck reaction as proof of concept, illustrating the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides.







Abstract
The unique reactivity and stability of enamides make them attractive reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we investigated the reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides in the formation of a C&#8722;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction using arylalkenyl boron&#8208;based reagents yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl enamides with an E configuration. The products obtained have been applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, an important scaffold in several biologically active compounds, via sequential Heck reaction to prove the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl enamides.

         <title>Immobilized Eosin Y on Modified Silica Nanoparticles and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized, functionalized with amino groups and covalently linked to Eosin Y (EY) through amide bonds. The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was characterized by microscospy and spectroscopy techniques. It displayed efficient photocatalytic activity in oxidation, reduction, and energy transfer reactions, demonstrating its potential as a heterogeneous photocatalyst with superior catalytic performance compared to its homogeneous counterpart.







Abstract
The development of novel photocatalytic systems is crucial for advancing sustainable chemical processes in organic synthesis. In this study, we report the preparation, characterization, and application of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on Eosin Y (EY) covalently immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including SEM, TEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and DLS. These analyses confirmed the successful immobilization of EY on SNPs and demonstrated the uniformity and favourable photophysical properties of the resulting hybrid material. The photocatalytic performance of SNPs&#8208;EY was evaluated in a series of model reactions, including aza&#8208;Henry reaction (cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling), reduction of nitrocompounds, and photooxidation of dimethylanthracene. The reaction results demonstrated that SNPs&#8208;EY is an effective and recyclable photocatalyst, offering yields comparable to or higher than those of homogeneous systems, while providing the advantages of easy separation and reuse. This study highlights the potential of SNPs&#8208;EY as a versatile photocatalyst for various organic transformations, promoting the advancement of green and sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Application of Laser&#8208;Generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) Furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal&#8208;support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal&#8208;support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.

&lt;p&gt;The photolabile &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl carbonate (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;NBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2-amino-2-deoxy-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glycosides.

         <title>(3+3)&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Mercaptobenzimidazoles With &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Styrene Under Ultrasonic Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol developed (3+3)&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene under ultrasonic irradiation. The cyclized product was formed through the Michael addition and intramolecular substitution reaction successively. The pure products were obtained with simple recrystallization.







Abstract
A rapid and facile sonochemical route for the [3+3] annulation of 2&#8208;mercapto benzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene was reported for the synthesis of fluorinated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]thiazines. The reaction proceeds through the SN2/SNV pathway while the selective SN2 pathway is completely inhibited. The developed method is effective with a wide range of substrates, tolerating diverse functional groups. The pure products are obtained with high yield (up to 92&#8201;%) directly via recrystallization without column chromatography. Furthermore, applying sonochemical methodology reduces the reaction time and eliminates the need for expensive photocatalysts, ligands or oxidants.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Physical Properties of ExTTF Substituted with Aryl Groups through Sulfur Bridges and the Electron Transfers with C60</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four molecular tweezers with good electron donor ability were synthesized and fully characterized. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption studies showed that intermolecular electron transfer existed between compounds 1&#8211;4 and C60.







Abstract
ExTTF derivatives (1&#8211;4) bearing aryl groups attached through sulfur bridges have been synthesized. The peripheral aryl groups have a certain influence on both the electronic and crystallographic properties of the exTTFs. Compounds 1&#8211;4 show two bands typical of exTTF derivatives near 360 and 430&#8197;nm. Compound 1 and 4 exhibit the characteristic electrochemical exTTF behavior, with one reversible two&#8208;electron process ranging depending on their substitution the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability. But 2 and 3 exhibit a similar single two&#8208;electron oxidation wave but electrochemically irreversible redox with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak potential separation. And 3 has a low redox potential, which is significantly inconsistent with the electron absorption of pyridine substituents. The crystal structures of 1&#8211;4 exhibit the characteristic butterfly shape. Moreover, the peripheral aryl groups exhibit multiple alignment modes with respect to the central exTTF core, caused by their rotation about the two C&#8722;S bonds of the sulfur bridges. Under the interaction of multiple molecules, exTTF shows different molecular packing structures. Compounds 1&#8211;4 have charge transfer with C60 due to their good electron&#8208;donating ability, butterfly configuration, and free rotation of peripheral aryl groups. These results indicate that 1&#8211;4 organic electronic materials have potential applications in the field of supramolecular assembly.

Abstract
Plastics play a crucial role in the survival and advancement of human civilization. However, the increasing challenge of plastic pollution presents significant obstacles. Disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling result in substantial resource wastage and pose potential environmental hazards. The slow progress in recycling and reusing waste plastics hinders their industrial application and effective response to environmental crises. Photocatalysis offers promising solutions for the future of plastic recycling, particularly with the recent increase in photocatalytic degradation methods for polystyrene (PS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the photooxidation of PS into high&#8208;value chemicals.

A wide scope of structurally diverse diazo reagents as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
A convenient method for the N&#8208;modification of NH&#8208;tetrazoles by the Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of diazocarbonyl compounds into the N&#8722;H bond has been proposed. A wide range of structurally diverse diazo reagents (including heterocyclic ones) as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity. It is shown that the regioselectivity of the reaction can decrease in the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the tetrazole, as well as in the presence of protic acids.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we have reported a reaction that allows performing a Knoevenagel condensation, its adduct reduction, and subsequent decarboxylation in a single preparative step using cheap, stable, and convenient sodium hypophosphite. No metal catalyst is required. The reaction is scalable. The limitations of the method are also described in the paper.







Abstract
Saturated carbon chain elongation is a common refrain in numerous synthetic pathways. While the formation of C&#8722;C single bonds is of primary importance in organic synthesis, the simultaneous introduction of functional groups such as nitrile or ester can reasonably increase its practical utility for the preparation of multifunctional products. The Knoevenagel reaction is a powerful tool to create carbon backbones of organic molecules; however, it requires subsequent reduction and/or decarboxylation to achieve a product with a saturated carbon chain. Herein we report a convenient one&#8208;step protocol for the reductive condensation between methyl cyanoacetate and aldehydes in the presence of stable, ecologically benign, cheap and available in bulk amounts sodium hypophosphite as a reductant. A description of both the reaction capabilities and limitations is given in this paper.

         <title>Construction of Sulfur(IV)&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric (4+2) Dipolar Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) cyclization was disclosed, providing a modular platform for the synthesis of chiral sulfur(IV)&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.







Abstract
Chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds play an important role in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral pharmaceuticals, and chiral materials. While great progress has been made in the synthesis of these compounds, the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles remains relatively limited compared to acyclic ones. In this study, we successfully report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of structurally diverse chirality&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur(IV) six&#8208;membered heterocycles under mild conditions via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) dipolar cyclization. More importantly, these products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
