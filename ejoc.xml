         <title>Synthesis of Lactones via Electrochemical Sequential Oxidative Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical lactone synthesis methodology has been developed, providing a rapid access to various dibenzopyranones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde, besides, 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid could also be transformed into corresponding dibenzopyranones in high efficiency. Various control experiments have been conducted to verify the mechanism of this electrochemical tandem oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we unveil a novel electrochemical oxidative strategy that facilitates the synthesis of lactones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acids. Crucially, our method allows for the convergent synthesis of lactones from the combinations of the respective 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid as starting material, owing to the oxidative process's compatibility within our electrochemical setup. This approach offers a robust and versatile pathway to construct various dibenzopyranones type lactone compounds through an environmentally considerate and economically advantageous process.

         <title>(Radio)Fluorination Reactions for the Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic fluorination and radiofluorination reactions offer a potent approach to synthesizing a variety of compounds that feature a fluorine atom. Organic fluorinated compounds have widespread applications in various fields, encompassing agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. This review summarizes recent advancements in the field and highlights notable accomplishments achieved.







Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bonds is an important research field in organic synthesis because inserting a fluorine atom into an organic compound can alter its physicochemical properties, such as metabolic stability and permeability. Due to this unique property, organic fluorinated compounds, especially aryl fluorides, have a wide range of applications in various fields, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Therefore, numerous metal&#8208; or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated fluorination reactions have been developed to synthesize aryl fluorides. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize recent ten years&#8217; advances in fluorination reactions for the synthesis of aryl fluorides.

         <title>Iron(&#921;&#921;&#921;) Catalyzed Aerobic C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; Cleavage of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under mild aerobic conditions is presented. The method constitutes a special case of the Mukaiyama hydration reaction, where the presence of a free hydroxyl group in the nearby carbon alters the fate of the reaction leading to the oxidative braking of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond. A broad selection of allylic alcohols has been examined and found to deliver useful for further functionalization products in good to excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies allowed us to propose a plausible pathway that may lead to the fragmentation products.







Abstract
The regiospecific C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under modified aerobic Mukaiyama hydration conditions is presented. The new methodology can be regarded as an equivalent of a two&#8208;step process, a typical hydration of the parent allylic alcohol followed by a 1,2&#8208;diol cleavage. A broad scope of substrates, both cyclic and acyclic, are applicable, thus introducing substantial structural modification to the core, especially of the former type of substrates. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction reveals the importance of the nearby hydroxyl group for the deviation from the typical Mukaiyama hydration pathway.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <dc:description>In this study, we use computations and experiments to explore mechanistic scenarios that govern the reaction between secondary amines and trifluoropropenyl iodonium triflate with the aim of rationalizing and predicting experimental outcomes. Based on the results from theory, we have compiled a list of guidelines relevant to synthetic strategies and provide examples for the interpretation of selectivities. To demonstrate the viability of these strategies, we have performed directed experiments applying different reaction conditions to obtain the products predicted by our model. Additionally, qualitative microkinetic simulations based on our computations were carried out for further support.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetically Reusable Fe3O4&#8208;CuO Nanoparticles as Catalyst for the Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Fluorescent Pyrazines for Fe Sensing and Ink Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrazines were synthesised from readily available methyl aryl/heteroaryl ketones and 1,2&#8208;diamines by using highly stable and reusable ferrite&#8208;stabilized copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4&#8208;CuO) as a catalyst. The synthesized pyrazines exhibited photophysical behaviour and large Stokes shifts and were explored as fluorescent probes for sensitive and selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; detection of iron. A luminescent pyrazine was also developed as a fluorescent ink.







Abstract
The synthesis of substituted pyrazines from readily available methyl aryl/heteroaryl ketones and 1,2&#8208;diamines was achieved using highly stable and reusable ferrite&#8208;stabilized copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4&#8208;CuO) as a catalyst. The reaction proceeds through a cascade imine formation&#8211;oxidative cyclization method under an oxygen atmosphere. The nanocatalysts were readily recovered and reused up to three consecutive cycles without any significant decrease in particle size, catalytic activity and reaction yield, as evidenced by analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). The synthesized pyrazines exhibited photophysical behaviour, displayed large Stokes shifts, and were explored as fluorescent probes for the sensitive as well as selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; detection of iron with a limit of detection of 0.63&#8197;&#956;M. The sensing method is also useful for the quantification of iron in spiked water samples. Furthermore, the application of luminescent pyrazines as fluorescent ink was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;Diketones Towards Catalytic Asymmetric Domino Michael&#8211;Henry Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyst with unique properties &#8211; 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine &#8211; activates unsymmetrical diketones by forming an enamine from only one side, while enolization does not constitute a significant competing mechanism.







Abstract
In this study, we explored a method to distinguish between both enolizable regions of unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diketones in organocatalytic domino reactions involving nitroalkenes. The selective formation of an enamine from only one side of the molecule was made possible by the use of optically pure 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine. This catalyst, remarkably enhancing the reaction, owes its efficacy to a unique interplay between basicity and nucleophilicity. These features caused the enolization of the substrate at the second possible site to be omitted. The approach resulted in excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (91&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) across various nitroalkenes, leading to the synthesis of novel cyclopentanone derivatives with three contiguous stereogenic center.

         <title>Accessing Polysubstituted NH Pyrroles from Nitroalkenes via [4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition/Reductive Ring Contraction Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition of nitroalkenes with enol ethers followed by reductive ring contraction of the resulting cyclic nitronates provides a new access to polysubstituted NH pyrroles. Unlike conventional synthetic routes (Barton&#8208;Zard, Knorr, Hantzsch, Van Leusen pyrrole syntheses), this strategy affords NH pyrroles that do not necessarily contain a EWG group in the ring.







Abstract
A novel two&#8208;step access to polysubstituted pyrroles from nitroalkenes was developed. It involves [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with enol ethers to give six&#8208;membered cyclic nitronates followed by reductive ring contraction with Ra&#8722;Ni/AcOH or Ra&#8722;Ni/EtOH systems. The process is applicable to a variety of nitroalkenes and enol ethers bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substituents and functional groups. The anti&#8208;inflammatory drug Bimetopyrol and its structural modifications were successfully synthesized by the strategy developed. The key side products were identified that provided an insight into the mechanism of the developed reductive ring contraction to pyrroles.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines in the MCR Universe</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, a privileged class of heterocycles with extensive applications in organic and medicinal chemistry, in four distinct IMCRs, aiming to generate compound libraries compatible for structural elaboration. Four scaffolds, 15 novel compounds with high diversity and complexity, along with single crystal structures for each scaffold have been obtained, revealing their potential relevance in drug discovery.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines constitute an accessible class of lead&#8208;like heterocycles with a vast application in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted Short Total Synthesis of Gochnatiolide D and Ainsliadimer A from Dehydrozaluzanin C</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's just a matter of solvent! The special properties of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can induce a one&#8208;pot dimerization&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;aldol sequence in dehydrozaluzanin C for the total synthesis of ainsliadimer A and gochnatiolide D.







Abstract
The total syntheses of gochnatiolide D and ainsliadimer A were achieved through a streamlined one&#8208;pot sequence starting from their biogenetic precursor dehydrozaluzanin C. These biomimetic, protecting group&#8208;free syntheses involve the elegant orchestration of the highly diastereoselective hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of dehydrozaluzanin C, its subsequent hydrolysis to gochnatiolide D and finally an aldol reaction to ainsliadimer A, all harnessed by the hydrogen bond propensity and acidity of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which was utilized as the reaction solvent.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Approach to the Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Pyrones via Hydration/Cyclization of Skipped Diynones under Basic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the presence of catalytic amounts of a secondary amine (e.g. morpholine), skipped diynones undergo hydration/cyclization in aqueous acetonitrile to form &#947;&#8208;pyrones in moderate to excellent yields. The first step of the process involves a trans&#8208;stereoselective conjugate&#8208;addition of morpholine to the ynone. Gradually the intermediate E&#8208;enaminone reacts with H2O yielding a hydration product via nucleophilic vinylic substitution. Then the amine adds to the second ynone moiety and the resulting enaminone is attacked intramolecularly by the enol hydroxyl to yield the &#947;&#8208;pyrone, with elimination of morpholine (regeneration of the catalyst). Primary amines fail to promote the process, as the initially formed Z&#8208;configurated enaminones are reluctant to react further under standard reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This manuscript describes a study of diverse reaction outcomes that stem from the ionization of aza&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Prins adducts. Experimental results have demonstrated unexpected behavior in the nitrogen&#8208;containing systems compared to the analogous oxygen derivatives derived from oxa&#8208;Prins/halo&#8208;Nazarov sequences. In&#8208;depth experimental studies and computational analysis revealed an intricate mechanism involving competing halo&#8208;Nazarov and imino&#8208;Nazarov pathways. These findings further elucidate the reaction chemistry of 3&#8208;halo&#8208;pentadienyl cation intermediates, and expand their utility in synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n = 5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n = 5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Reactivity of Viologens in Alkaline Solutions Via Cucurbit[7]uril Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To study the reactivity of viologens in alkaline solutions, their H/D exchange rates were evaluated by 1H NMR. The optimized ratio of cucurbit[7]uril:viologen reversed the proton reactivity and controlled the deuteration site on dissymmetric viologens. This strategy featured a CB[n] supramolecular regioselective functionalization.







Abstract
A series of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and N&#8208;aryl&#8208;viologens has been studied in alkaline solutions. In this work, we evaluated the deuteration rate of the viologens in D2O solutions of pH values ranging from 7.3 to 12.7. Kinetic experiments and computational calculations showed the high reactivity of H&#8722;C(2) bonds toward deprotonation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium moieties compared to N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;pyridinium moieties, even in hybrid N&#8208;aryl/N&#8208;alkyl dissymmetric viologens. However this high H&#8722;C(2) reactivity in liquid phase contrasted with the proton fragmentation mechanism observed in the gas phase by mass spectrometry. The H/D exchange rate of viologens in very strong alkaline conditions could be significantly reduced using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) as supramolecular protecting group. Ultimately, CB[7] inclusion led to a selective protection of H&#8722;C(2) group of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium of dissymmetric viologens, and induced a supramolecular regioselective deuteration.

         <title>Synthesis of (E)&#8208;Enaminoesters by a 1,6&#8208;Addition/Fragmentation Cascade Involving Coumalic Acid Esters and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based coumalates were found to be renewable surrogates for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based propiolates for the stereoselective synthesis of (E)&#8208;enaminoesters. Insight into the reaction mechanism is provided. The process is thought to involve an original uncatalyzed 1,6&#8208;addition/fragmentation cascade involving secondary amines.







Abstract
Coumalic acid methyl ester (methyl coumalate), a biomass&#8208;derived building block, was converted into (E)&#8208;enaminoesters by an original uncatalyzed stereoselective 1,6&#8208;addition/fragmentation cascade involving secondary amines. The transformation occurred under useful experimental conditions as a simple heating of a stoichiometric mixture of the starting compounds led to the desired products. The reaction could be extended to a range of alkyl coumalates and a variety of secondary amines. Given the original character of the transformation, the reaction mechanism was discussed. Therefore, the cascade is supposed to involve a 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition followed by a fragmentation sequence leading ultimately to the decarboxylative elimination of (E)&#8208;enaminoesters. Using this procedure, renewable coumalic acid proved to be a valuable alternative to fossil fuel&#8208;based propiolates for the preparation of enaminoesters.

         <title>Saturated Heterocyclic Sulfamoyl Fluorides: Building Blocks for the SuFEx Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable protocol for direct SO2F2&#8208;based fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines is reported. The method is cost&#8208;effective and applicable for multigram preparation of structurally diverse compounds, as illustrated by the synthesis of 58 building blocks decorated with common functional groups. A comparison of overall yields of products demonstrates the advantages of the present method over alternative approaches. The obtained functionalized sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx (sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry. The synthetic utility of the synthesized building blocks was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage reactions tolerating the SO2F functionality as well as transformations to provide the corresponding sulfamide, sulfamate, and sulfonamide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptable Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Disaccharide Subtypes Preprogrammed for Regiospecific O&#8208;Sulfation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors, including rarer subtypes such as CS&#8208;D, has been developed. From common intermediates, a series of thioglycoside&#160;D&#8208;glucosyl&#160;donors and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected&#160;D&#8208;galactosamine acceptors are utilised in a robust glycosylation reaction, achieving &#946;&#8208;selectivity and consistent yields (60&#8208;75%) on scales &gt;2.0 g. A post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation to&#160;D&#8208;glucuronic acid&#160;and orthogonal protecting groups delivers access to CS&#8208;A, CS&#8208;C, CS&#8208;D, CS&#8208;E and CS&#8208;O precursor subtypes. Of further note is a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl regioselective reductive ring opening of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected disaccharide using dichlorophenylborane (PhBCl&#173;2) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH)&#160;to access a CS&#8208;D precursor, in 73% yield over two steps. Finally, synthesis of a 6&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated CS&#8208;C disaccharide containing a conjugable anomeric allyl tether is completed. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advancements in the synthesis of chiral allenes through asymmetric 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes, in which two distinct strategies including non&#8208;radical and radical processes are highlighted, aiming to provide valuable insights and ideas for further studies in this field.







Abstract
Allenes represent a distinctive class of organic molecules characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, chiral allenes play a significant role in modern chemistry. They not only serve as pivotal frameworks for natural products and drug molecules but also are essential building blocks in organic synthesis. Over the years, numerous remarkable and efficient methods have been developed for the synthesis of chiral allenes. Notably, the catalytic synthesis of chiral allenes using transition metals in conjunction with chiral ligands has garnered considerable attention. This review paper aims to provide an overview of recent advancements in the synthesis of chiral allenes through asymmetric 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes, in which two distinct strategies including non&#8208;radical and radical processes are highlighted.

         <title>Synthesis of Deoxy Pyranosides Via Fe(III) Catalyzed Regioselective Thiocarbonylation of Partially Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation was disclosed. The selective thiocarbonylation could be smoothly achieved through FeCl3 assisted by benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) in the presence of K2CO3. Further reduction can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents.







Abstract
Rapid and efficient synthesis of targeted deoxygenated glycosides is highly desired. Herein, we disclose a two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars from partially protected pyranosides via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation. The selectivity can be smoothly achieved through anhydrous FeCl3 as the catalyst assisted by low&#8208;priced benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) ligand in the presence of K2CO3 as base. Further deoxygenation can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents in traditional procedures. Conspicuous features of this method include mild conditions, easy operation, high selectivity and non or low toxic reagents, making it a more attractive strategy.

         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of asymmetric &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids derivatives through organocatalyzed Michael addition of &#945;&#8208;aryl isocyanoacetates and aurone&#8208;derived azadienes. The corresponding products bearing a benzofuran scaffold in their structure with two adjacents sctereocenters were obtained in high yields and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective organocatalytic Michael addition of &#945;&#8208;aryl isocyanoacetates to aurone&#8208;derived azadienes under mild conditions has been developed. This efficient methodology enables access to chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino ester derivatives with two adjacent stereocenters, one of them quaternary, bearing a benzofuran scaffold in their structure in high yields and stereocontrol. Furthermore, the reaction product can be readily converted into an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acid in high yield via hydrolysis of the isocyano group without compromising enantioselectivity.

         <title>Trifluoromethylsulfinyl Compounds: Recent Synthetic Approaches and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. The review systematically summarizes recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. Compared with the indirect methods, direct trifluoromethylsulfinylation by employing available trifluoromethylsulfinylating reagents is an important and elegant strategy for the rapid assembly of valuable CF3S(O)&#8208;derived organic molecules. This review focuses on the recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high yields and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

Abstract
An efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted lawsones using a catalytic amount of Sc(OTf)3 in toluene at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C through a Buchner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck reaction. It is a versatile method to produce a large number of 3&#8208;aryl, 3&#8208;styryl, 3&#8208;alkyl, and 3&#8208;heteroaryl substituted lawsones under mild conditions. This is a first report on the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted lawsones in high yields with in short reaction times.

Herein, we report a mild Lewis acid&#8208;promoted regiospecific and reaction course&#8208;dependent transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarins/4&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones/4&#8208;azido&#8208;thiocoumarin into structurally diversified C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazoles via single step and 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepines via two steps with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration, through the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine and cyclic indium complex.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient route for coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazole scaffolds via indium chloride&#8208;mediated single&#8208;step transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin with amines/aldehydes and coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepine scaffolds with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration through two&#8208;step sequential synthesis via the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. A plausible mechanistic pathway has been proposed from the control/entrapment experiments and 1H&#8208;NMR studies. This protocol provides the reaction condition&#8208;dependent product selectivity, structural diversification, and excellent yields.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Lewis Acids in the Catalytic Activity of Urea&#8208;Based Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were carried out to quantitatively rationalize the poorly understood factors leading to the enhanced catalytic activity of ureas having a Lewis acid in their structure in the nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitrocyclopropanes.







Abstract
Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations have been carried out to understand both the origin of the catalysis in the urea&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of nitrocyclopropanes and the acceleration induced by the presence of an internal Lewis acid in the catalyst. To this end, the mode of activation of these ureas is quantitatively analyzed in detail by means of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity in combination with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. It is found that the presence of the Lewis acid in the urea further enhances the interaction between the reactants, by increasing both the electrostatic and orbital attractions, which translates into a reduced activation barrier. This insight is also used to assess the impact of the nature of the Lewis acid on the transformation, facilitating the rational design of more active catalysts.

         <dc:description>This article reports the synthesis of alpha&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;beta&#8208;seleno amides containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds by selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamine amides with diaryl diselenides under visible light irradiation. This protocol proceeds well to provide the 30 desired products with yields of 37%&#8208;80% using the 12 W blue LED as light source under room temperature conditions. Moreover, diaryl diselenides plays a dual role as a substrate and a photoactive reagent, as well as oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, thus avoiding the extra addition of environmentally unfriendly photoctalysts and oxidants.</dc:description>

The transformation is catalyzed by iron chloride and proceeds with the formation of two new bonds and two stereocenters diastereoselectively. The same catalyst also promotes the formation of these products via a one&#8208;pot tandem Knoevenagel condensation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones and citral or farnesal aldehydes, followed by cycloisomerization establishing a direct assembly of this important scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>High Yield Synthesis of Spirocyclic Dienones from Phenols Employing Tribromide Catalysed Dearomatization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative attempts to convert planar arenols to structurally complex entities have been an enthusiastic goal. In this report we elaborate the employability of tribromide catalysis towards dearomative attempts of arenols to spirocyclic dieneones. The facile reaction conditions of the transformation make it the best of the available ones.







Abstract
A catalytic strategy towards the tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization reaction is described employing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and oxone as an oxidising agent. This methodology leads to the exclusive formation of spirofurano dienones without rearomatization or halogenation. Our group has been on trails of tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative transformation during the last decade, and now this exhibits the first report which delivers high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and good diastereoselectivity (dr up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1). The oxidation of naphthols as well as phenols is achieved under this mild conditions.

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: A Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;methyltetrahydropyran (4&#8208;MeTHP) as reaction medium have been highlighted in two organometallic&#8208;mediated transformations performed under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable stability of the organolithium species involved in the anionic Fries rearrangement of binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208;carbamates, and superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other sustainable solvents have been disclosed in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;(bis)carboxamide derivatives.







Abstract
We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP constitutes a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction medium are illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents are observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high stereoselectivity, working at 0&#8201;&#176;C and under air.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Pyridone ribo&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides via Heck Reaction and Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective method for the synthesis of ribo&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides is described that relies on a Heck reaction, followed by epoxidation with TFDO, desilylation and reduction with borohydride to give access to this important class of compounds without the need for reaction conditions incompatible with reactive groups or separation of anomers.







Abstract
Nucleosides find applications in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and diagnostics. Among the nucleosides, C&#8208;nucleosides have attracted particular attention because their carbon&#8208;carbon bond between nucleobase and ribose provides stability against degradation. While several well&#8208;established methods exist for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides, the preparation of their ribofuranosyl counterparts is more challenging. Established methods for their synthesis give mixtures of anomers and require harsh reagents or conditions. Here we report a diastereoselective glycosylation method involving a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aryl iodide, followed by oxidation of the silyl enol ether with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO). The resulting ketone is then diastereoselectively reduced to the ribonucleoside. The new route has been applied to pyridones and is expected to also yield other ribo&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides in diastereoselective fashion.

         <title>Synthesis of Molsidomine and Mesocarb Analog via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of N6&#8208;functionalized iminosydnones following a four steps convergent strategy was designed. 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was used as an activating agent, the whole process being carried out in the solid state in ball&#8208;mills. It offered an efficient and sustainable access to molsidomine and a mesocarb analog, two bioactive iminosydnones.







Abstract
Iminosydnones (ImSyds) have renowned biological activities and attractive chemical properties for chemical biology. However, access to N6&#8208;functionalized iminosydnones involves tricky and hazardous procedures. Thanks to an innovative mechanochemical strategy using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as an activating agent, a straightforward synthesis of molsidomine and of a mesocarb analog, two bioactive iminosydnones, was achieved. The whole process, involving 4 linear steps, was carried out in the solid state by ball&#8208;milling and with safe reagents, offering efficient and sustainable access to N&#8208;carbonylated iminosydnones, in agreement with the principles of green chemistry.

         <title>Trifluoromethoxylation of Arynes Using 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxybenzene) as Trifluoromethoxide Anion Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trifluoromethoxylation of arynes has been little reported in the literature mainly due to the limited number of stable trifluoromethoxide anion sources existing. We describe herein the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes using 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as a cheap and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use source of F3CO&#8722;. The released trifluoromethoxide anion was used as both a source of fluoride to generate the aryne and a nucleophile for the trifluoromethoxylation reaction.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy moiety, an emerging fluorinated group, shows interesting properties for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. However, only few methods have been reported for the direct introduction of this group on molecules with high efficiency, safety and low cost. Indeed, most of direct trifluoromethoxylation reagents are either expensive, hazardous or require preliminary synthesis before their use. Here we describe the use of 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, safe, commercially available and cheap source of trifluoromethoxide anion for the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Ketones by Photocatalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Aromatic Acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones were synthesized from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids by photoredox catalysis. This method involves phosphoranyl radical promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids and hydroacylation of &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes with the generated acyl radicals.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl alkenes are versatile CF3&#8208;containing feedstocks. They have been widely used to construct gem&#8208;difluoroalkene scaffolds through &#946;&#8722;F elimination. The application of &#945;&#8722;CF3 alkenes as trifluoromethylating reagents has been less explored. Herein, we report an efficient route for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated ketones from readily accessed &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids under photoredox catalysis. The reactions proceed by phosphoranyl radical promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids, generating acyl radicals for subsequent hydroacylation of &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes. The valuable trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds could be produced in good yields under mild conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Bisspiro(oxindole)s by DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of Isatin&#8208;Derived Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric [3+2] cyclization of isatin&#8208;derived MBH carbonates with p&#8208;QMs was successfully executed utilizing DMAP&#8208;derived catalysts. This process afforded bisspiro(oxindole)s, featuring both cyclopentene and cyclohexadienone motifs, in good yields and enantioselectivity as well as excellent diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A straightforward [3+2] annulation method for synthesizing bisspiro(oxindole) derivatives has been developed by using isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates and p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the catalyst. The optimized protocol in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent achieves good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). The versatility of the method is shown through the synthesis of various derivatives, including chiral variants with up to 82&#8201;% ee. The intermediates were captured by HRMS, and a plausible reaction pathway was proposed.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Antifungal Agent Voriconazole via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;Alkene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of voriconazole, a synthetically challenging antifungal agent was achieved in nine steps with a 8&#8201;% overall yield. This novel strategy relied on the precise synthesis of tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol and the subsequent highly efficient epoxidation to establish the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.







Abstract
A concise asymmetric synthesis of triazole antifungal agent voriconazole is described. Salient features of this synthesis include a LiOH&#8208;controlled highly stereospecific formation of (Z)&#8208;enol triflate from 2&#8208;difluorobenzene acetoacetate to access the crucial tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol, and a highly enantioselective VO(OiPr)3/BHA ligand&#8208;catalyzed epoxidation to construct the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to access C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Formyl Group Migration Triggered Remote Desaturation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photocatalytic formyl group migration&#8208;triggered remote desaturation is realized, producing a library of functionalized trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. The controllable installation of three functional groups, such as CF3, CHO, and a C&#8722;C double bond, provides a very attractive protocol for rapid synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8722;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation. It provides a good complementary approach to the existing desaturation protocols.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Indirect and Regioselective Phosphonation of Azobenzenes: Toward the Design of Water&#8208;Soluble Photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes enabling the regioselective introduction of the double&#8208;functionalized phophonoacetate motif was developed. The method proved tolerant for a wide range of substituents. Chemoselective hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate function leads to a water&#8208;soluble azobenzene with interesting photophysical properties, holding great promise for the design of water&#8208;soluble photochemical tools for future biological applications.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethylphosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalization tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.

         <title>CO&#8208;Boosted Protocol for the Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Thiolation of Aldehydes Using Phenylthiobenzenesulfonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formyl C&#8722;H thiolation of aldehydes using phenylthio benzenesulfonate was achieved using a decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst under CO atmosphere, giving good yields of thioesters.







Abstract
The formyl C&#8722;H thiolation of aldehydes using thiosulfonates and the decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst is reported. Using this photocatalytic protocol together with a CO atmosphere, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields. The transformation consists of a cascade of double SH2 reactions, HAT and an ArS group transfer. CO atmosphere effectively limits the extent of decarbonylation of acyl radicals that are generated in the reaction.

The Front Cover shows an older rose representing the known initial product of a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aglycone, a silylenol ether, and two younger, fresher roses, representing the two products that can now be accessed via convenient, robust and diastereoselective routes from that same initial product. This is a graphical analogy to our synthetic method, with which C&#8208;nucleosides for incorporation into DNA and RNA strands can now be obtained in a streamlined singly branched synthetic scheme.

         <title>Functionalization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Derivatives under Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 28, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced or electrochemically catalytic functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to construct diverse allyl compounds with valuable groups was reviewed. Through direct 1,4&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;, or 2&#8208;functionalization, a lot of functional groups, such as alkyl groups, nucleophilic reagents, phosphoryl groups, aryl groups, or alkyl alcohol, were introduced in mild, green, and atom&#8208;economy conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene has become an attractive strategy for constructing allyl compounds with molecular and structural complexity, and the current research focuses on synthetic chemistry and organic synthesis. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the synthesis methods promoted by photochemistry or electrochemistry represent an environmentally friendly and mild strategy. In this review, the functionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene under photochemical/electrochemical processes in recent years are reviewed according to the classification of functionalization systems, with particular emphasis on the corresponding reaction mechanism, which lays a foundation for further exploration of new catalytic methods.

&lt;p&gt;A formal [4+2] annulation reaction of phthalaldehydes and 3-ylideneoxindoles through a tandem process of a Stetter&#8211;aldol reaction was accomplished by the application N-heterocyclic carbenes as effective catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal [4+2] annulation reaction of phthalaldehydes and 3-ylideneoxindoles through a tandem process of a Stetter&#8211;aldol reaction was accomplished by the application N-heterocyclic carbenes as effective catalysts. Under mild conditions, this unprecedented cascade reaction readily occurs in good yield, enabling straightforward access to functionalized tetrahydronaphthalene-fused spirooxindoles. For the first time, the feasibility of an asymmetric Stetter&#8211;aldol reaction has also been briefly explored by employing chiral organic bases to promote the asymmetric transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals' Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2&#8208;substitution (electron&#8208;withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1&#8208;aminoglycosides through this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Aldol Couplings of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones: Stereoselective Synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 Fragment of Tuscoron A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reliable protocols for synthesis of furan&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were developed and the resulting heterocycles were coupled to elaborate aldehydes in aldol couplings and condensations in good to high selectivity. Application of these methods allowed for a concise and highly stereroselective synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 fragment of the complex polyketide natural product tuscoron A.







Abstract
Various strategies for synthesis and stereroselective aldol coupling of furan&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were evaluated that eventually enabled a highly stereroselective synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 fragment of tuscoron A.

         <dc:description>Nitrile&#8208;stabilized quaternary ammonium ylide as an effective aryl&#8208;cyanomethylene transfer agent has been explored for the first time, which enables a spirocyclopropanation process with conjugated carboxamide of indole heterocycle.

The common difficulties of a cyclopropanation process, e.g., a conjugated carboxamide as valid substrate, cleavage&#8208;susceptibility of amide bond, substrates scope limited to preferentially electron&#8208;withdrawing group containing molecules, and the competing dehydrocyanation reaction of product generated from nitrile&#8208;stabilized ylide have been overcome in the present spirocyclopropanation process.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A room temperature Ni&#8208;catalyzed, Mn&#8208;mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre&#8208;activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between ortho&#8208;Cl and para&#8208;Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double&#8208;face role of TMSCl, i.e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl&#8208;activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant. Applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in a multigram synthesis of Daclatasvir.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Key Skeleton of Mohangic Acids A&#8208;E</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible route for the stereoselective synthesis of the key skeleton of mohangic acids A&#8722;E has been developed. Notably, intermolecular Heck coupling has been introduced to couple an unactivated alkene with an iodo&#8208;diene counterpart to install the required triene system of the molecules. The developed strategy is highly modular.







Abstract
The key skeleton that could allow to access structurally intriguing mohangic acids A&#8722;E has been synthesized in stereoselective manner. The salient features of this synthesis include Evans syn&#8208;aldol reaction to construct the C&#8208;11 and C&#8208;12 centers, HWE olefination to construct C14&#8722;C15 bond, Evans asymmetric methylation to install C&#8208;14 center and Crimmins acetate aldol to generate C&#8208;15 center whereas Wittig and Takai olefinations to prepare the C8&#8211;C9 &amp; C6&#8211;C7 alkenes, respectively, and Heck reaction to couple C1&#8211;C5 &amp; C6&#8211;C17 segments of the molecules. The developed route is highly modular and useful for accessing diverse natural product like molecules for future investigations.

Meso&#8208;3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl calix[4]pyrrole 1 binds cyanate anion with high affinity and form an unprecedented dimeric capsular assembly, {(TMA)2[12&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SCN)2]}, in the solid state mediated by CF&#8722;FC noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Cis&#8208;5,15&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole (1) forms stable 1/1 complexes with linear anions such as N3&#8722;, SCN&#8722; and NCO&#8208; with the highest affinity for NCO&#8722; anion in acetonitrile solution. Crystallization of receptor 1 with TBASCN and (TMA)2SO4 resulted in the formation of dimeric capsular assembly, {(TMA)2[12&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SCN)2]}, in which two thiocyanate anions are encapsulated. On the other hand, 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OCN(TMA) and 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N3(TMA) complexes form one dimensional columnar structure in the solid state.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This streamlined protocol offers a straightforward route for the dihalogenation (F, Cl, and Br) of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with high yields and exceptional functional group compatibility. Additionally, bromodifluoromethyl and chlorodifluoromethyl groups demonstrated efficacy in generating trifluoromethylated products with outstanding yields. Furthermore, we successfully employed the dihalogenated product in 18F&#8208;labeling.







Abstract
We established a straightforward electrochemical dihalogenation (F, Cl, and Br) process for gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This reaction exhibits a broad functional group tolerance and has been effectively utilized in the construction of complex molecules. The subsequent synthetic transformations of the products have highlighted the adaptable nature of the dihalogenated compounds, demonstrating their potential application in drug discovery and the investigation of innovative materials. The effective utilization of the dihalogenated product for 18F&#8208;labeling represents a novel approach in generating highly potent 18F&#8208;labeled tracers.

Herein, we describe difluoroalkylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones via the addition of difluoroacetate radicals. This reaction is amenable to a wide range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and difluoroalkyl reagents, providing various difluoroalkylation of C2&#8208; tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aryl indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with moderate to good yields. The resulting adducts, which contain a CF2 unit, can be further converted into other crucial molecular components.







Abstract
Here, we have successfully achieved the addition of difluoroacetate radicals to 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, enabling various difluoroalkylations of C2&#8208;tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aryl indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in a highly efficient and economical manner. It is worth mentioning that these difluoroalkylation compounds can be easily transformed into various derivatives under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments suggest the involvement of ethyl difluoroacetate radical species in the reaction.

         <title>Detection and Differentiation of Amines and N&#8208;Heterocycles via Recognition Enabled Chromatographic 19F NMR</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study employs a 19F&#8208;lableled probe that reversibly interacts various analytes, producing discrete 19F NMR signals corresponding to each analyte. The method features a wide detection scope and easily interpretable output, facilitating the effective and precise identification of various active components from complex real&#8208;world samples, such as food, beverage, mask essence and whitening essence.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully employed a 19F&#8208;labeled cyclopalladium probe to achieve simultaneous differentiation and detection of various amines and N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. This method features a broad detection window, facilitating the discrimination and multi&#8208;component analysis of structural analogs and isomers through the generation of characteristic 19F NMR signals with distinct chemical shifts. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in monitoring chemical reactions and identifying components in food, beverages, and cosmetics.

         <title>Fabrication of a Highly Efficient and Reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al Monolithic Catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst is designed for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reach 73,880 and 0.86&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture using tweezers without any loss of catalytic activity over 14 cycles.







Abstract
Anodization was employed to treat the aluminum foil surface, leading to in&#8197;situ the generation of Al2O3, consequently amplifying the specific surface area to aid in the dispersal of palladium nanoparticles. Through the anodic oxidation of aluminum followed by a precipitation&#8208;deposition and calcination process, a highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst was synthesized. The effectiveness and reusability of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst were evaluated in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reached 73,880 and 0.86&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered and reused in reactions regardless of the used substrates.

         <title>New Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of Curcumin&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes for OLED Devices</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By pursuing s structure&#8208;property relationship approach, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the performances of the OLED devices fabricated by using of a series of iridium(III) complexes featuring natural or nature&#8208;inspired &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands. This revealed that both luminance, efficiency and power efficiency were strongly influenced by the tendency of the complexes to fo.rm aggregates by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions.







Abstract
Among the solid&#8208;state lighting technologies, OLEDs occupy a prominent position for the high efficiencies associated with the low CO2 emissions. In line with the recent studies aimed at designing sustainable and biodegradable devices, herein we report on the synthesis of a series of iridium(III) complexes featuring, as &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands, curcumin and 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione, two natural compounds found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale. To improve the solubility of both the ligands and prevent the aggregation of the complexes, oleoyl residues were inserted on the phenolic &#8722;OH groups. The resulting complexes exhibited a green emission with quantum yields as high as 2.8&#8201;% (relative to fluorescein). OLED devices were fabricated by using, as emitting layer, a host&#8208;guest blend of the iridium complex in 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl (CBP). The morphological analysis revealed that thin films of the emitting layer were homogeneous. The devices fabricated with iridium complexes from 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione exhibited higher luminance, efficiency and power efficiency with respect to the corresponding devices obtained from curcumin; also the functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;diketone unit with the oleoyl residue proved to increase significantly the performance of the device. Overall, these data suggest that aggregation is a key factor that compromise the performances of the corresponding OLEDs.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient method for the conversion of biphenyl acrylamides to dibenzoazepinones with &#8722;SCF3 incorporation is described. This operationally simple radical cascade reaction employs CAN as an oxidant and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Substrates featuring &#8722;OCH3, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;Br or &#8722;Cl at the para&#8208;position of the aromatic ring exhibits a preference for an ipso&#8208;cyclization due to the intervention of DMSO in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide valuable insights into the reaction's energetics and product selectivity.

A highly effective method utilizing KOtBu is reported for the regioselective production of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles.







Abstract
A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ transformation of the nitrile moiety into an amide group followed by the selective C&#8722;N bond formation through a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies as it avoids use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affords the products in high yields. Additionally, the current methodology provides several additional advantages, such as one&#8208;pot operation, high atom economy, broad substrate scope and a step&#8208;economical process.

         <title>Mixed Liquid and Solid Phase Synthesis of Isopeptidic Desferrioxamine Analogues for Complexation of Zirconium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper a fast and efficient solid phase synthesis of isopeptide analogs of the natural siderophore desferrioxamine B is reported. The protocol allows the rapid synthesis of tetra hydroxamic acids suitable for complexation of Zr.







Abstract
89Zr has a number of advantageous properties for PET&#8208;imaging, but optimal chelators for its widespread clinical application still need to be found. Tetrahydroxamates derived from the natural siderophore DFOB are promising candidates in this context. This study describes a solid&#8208;phase approach to isopeptide analogs of DFOB (termed ipDFO*) with four hydroxamate groups for stable Zr(IV)&#8208;chelation. The route uses either commercial or easily available Fmoc&#8208;protected precursors and allows the synthesis of ipDFO* and clickable AZA&#8722;ipDFO* derivatives in only a few hours. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis reduces the workload for the synthesis of ipDFO* and AZA&#8722;ipDFO* derivatives thus significantly compared to a previous multistep solution synthesis. The route is also modular and allows the synthesis of various ipDFO* derivatives with variation in the spacer length between the hydroxamate groups. This spacing is a critical parameter for finding the optimal chelator for hard metal cations like Zr(IV). It might thus help to speed up the search for an ideal Zr&#8208;chelator for PET&#8208;imaging and might also allow the extension to other metal cations of different size.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryl N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;Protected Diamines via Organocatalytic Arylation of 5&#8208;Aminoisoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazoles and pyrazolo fused pyrimidines and pyridines are well known for their applications in various fields like pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials sciences. Keeping this in mind herein, we have developed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the chemo&#8208;selective synthesis of the pyrazole and its derivatives from acetopheneones. The selectivity of the reaction can easily be tuned by shifting reaction from acidic to basic medium for the synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;pyrirmidines and pyrazolo&#8208;pyridines respectively. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance in the form of &#8211;F, &#8211;Cl, &#8211;Br, &#8211;NMe2, &#8211;OH, &#8211;OMe, and &#8211;B(OH)2 in good yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Organic Synthesis: An Italian Journey through Innovations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contribution of Italy to the development of mechanochemistry dates back to 1988 with the first studies on metal alloys. With the progress of time, it has flourished not only in the field of organic chemistry, but also in other scientific fields due to the enormous interest of Italian researchers in the various advantages brought by this technique.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, as an enabling technology, harnesses mechanical force to drive chemical reactions, presenting compelling advantages in organic synthesis within the principles of green chemistry. This review explores how its unique advantages and alignment with sustainable practices have been widely developed in different scientific fields in Italy. As a transformative strategy for organic synthesis, mechanochemistry has been portrayed in this review as a valuable synthetic alternative due to the various advantages, such as solvent reduction and new reaction pathways, that its use brings. Nonetheless, the improvements brought about by its use have also been crucial in other fields of chemistry described by Italian scientists. In this whole context, Italian researchers have analysed both already optimised processes and new feasible pathways, paving the way for new avenues previously hampered by all the limitations that belong to in&#8208;solution chemistry.

         <title>Theoretical Mechanism Study of BH3&#8208;Mediated Reduction of P&#8208;Stereogenic Hydroxyalkylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations explain the experimentally observed reactivity and stereospecificity for BH3&#8208;mediated reductions of P&#8208;stereogenic hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides. The proposed computed pathway suggests the formation of a cyclic intermediate and of borohydride as hydride donor.







Abstract
The BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of P&#8208;stereogenic hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides was investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations. By combining theoretical approaches with experimental observations, we explored two mechanisms that account for its stereospecificity, implying an inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus atom. One mechanism proceeds through a cyclic intermediate in which the coordination of borane to the oxygen atoms lowers the BH3.THF&#8208;attack barrier. However, the free energy barrier for this combined process is too high for a reaction feasible at room temperature. The calculations rather support a second mechanism that proceeds through from the same cyclic intermediate and the in&#8208;situ formation of BH4&#8722; as reducing agent.

         <title>Fluorinated Chiral Pyrans Obtained via Mechanochemical Organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalysis for The Oxidative Dearomatization of pyrrole
Derivatives: Mechanistic Insights and Biological Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Core&#8208;Modified Calixporphyrinoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp2 and sp3meso&#8208;carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as m/p&#8208;phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core&#8208;modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kanamycin&#8722;Cu(II) Complex Catalyzed Ullmann Amine Synthesis at Room Temperature: A Tool for Mechanistic Insights into Methylene Blue Degradation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformative potential of kanamycin&#8722;copper (II) complexes for Ullmann amine synthesis at room temperature showcases the efficient creation of diverse N&#8722;aryl compounds via SO4&#8722;&#8226; mediated generation of Cu(III)&#8722;aryl species. Additionally, it highlights the catalyst's role in degrading methylene blue, advancing both catalytic methodologies and environmental applications.







Abstract
This study highlights the significance of the Ullmann coupling reaction in modern organic synthesis and advances catalytic methodologies through the introduction of a kanamycin&#8722;copper complex as a highly efficient catalyst for the synthesis of diverse N&#8722;aryl compounds. We demonstrate the catalyst's versatility by synthesizing 20 diaryl&#8722;amine instances, 21 Ar(het)&#8722;N compounds, and 10 miscellaneous examples. NMR, IR, and UV spectroscopy offer insights into the catalyst's behaviour. Additionally, DFT studies support the catalyst's proficiency in generating SO4&#8722;&#8901; radicals by stabilizing with amino sugar moieties. Ex&#8208;situ NMR experiments confirm a ternary complex&#8208;based mechanism at concentrations below 0.1&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, we showcase the degradation of methylene blue to its precursor amine under optimized conditions. Overall, this research underscores the potential of Ullmann condensation reactions in contemporary organic synthesis and contributes significantly to the advancement of catalytic methodologies.

         <dc:description>Dynamic thermodynamic resolution of amino acids (AAs) using Ni(II) chiral Schiff bases is one of the simplest and most efficient methods to obtain optically active AAs. A comparison of the reactivity of&#160;36&#160;rac&#8208;AAs with the Ni(II) complex revealed that this method can be easily applied to dynamic thermodynamic resolution and&#160;S/R&#160;interconversion of AAs with unprotected active functional groups.

         <title>Understanding Gold&#8208;Alkyne Activation from Bond Dissociation Energies of Gold&#8208;Alkyne Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand effect has been intensively studied on gold(I)&#8208;alkyne complexes bearing ligands commonly used in gold catalysis. The bond dissociation energy (BDE) of gold&#8208;alkyne interactions has been realized by energy resolved collision induced dissociation (CID). This work is expected to contribute to understanding the alkyne activation in homogenous gold catalysis.







Abstract
A detailed approach into electronic effects of ligands on gold&#8208;alkyne interactions has been carried out in the gas phase using tandem mass spectrometry. A semi&#8208;empirical method coupled to DFT calculations was used to quantify ligands effects on Au&#8722;CC bond strength. To this end, the critical energies of 16 [L&#8722;Au&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;yne]+ complexes with different L ligands were determined through collision induced dissociation. It was observed that electron&#8208;rich ligands destabilize the gold&#8208;alkyne bond, whereas phosphites and carbenes strengthened it. The influence of alkyne electronic effects on the gold&#8208;alkyne bond has also been studied by dissociation in tandem mass spectrometry on four different alkynes. In an original approach, two successive ion&#8208;molecule reactions within the mass spectrometer were used to measure the relative affinity of gold to an alkyne by exchange reactions. The result is that the more electron&#8208;rich the alkyne, the stronger the gold&#8208;alkyne bond.

To this end, the critical energies of 16 [L&#8722;Au-hex-3-yne]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with different L ligands were determined through collision induced dissociation. It was observed that electron-rich ligands destabilize the gold-alkyne bond, whereas phosphites and carbenes strengthened it. The influence of alkyne electronic effects on the gold-alkyne bond has also been studied by dissociation in tandem mass spectrometry on four different alkynes. In an original approach, two successive ion-molecule reactions within the mass spectrometer were used to measure the relative affinity of gold to an alkyne by exchange reactions. The result is that the more electron-rich the alkyne, the stronger the gold-alkyne bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linear &#960;&#8208;Extension of Acridone by the Fusion of Cyclobutadienoid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct functionalization of acridone via catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation and subsequent aromatization leads to the formation of its linear conjugation&#8208;extended derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid. The presence of four&#8208;membered ring has no influences on the electronic structure of pyridone unit and molecular stability in comparison to those of acridone.







Abstract
The functionalization of small aromatic heterocycles is a straight and efficient method to access large polycyclic conjugated molecules. However, due to its unique reactivity, the derivatization of acridone usually gives the product in the angular shape and is difficult to obtain the linear ones. Here we report the direct functionalization of acridone to generate its linearly fused derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation followed by the dehydrated aromatization. The experimental characterizations demonstrate that the antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid ring can extend the molecular conjugation. Theoretical calculations reveal the weakened aromaticity of neighboring benzenoid rings of cyclobutadienoid with no influence on the electronic structure of central pyridone. The molecular stability is enhanced in comparison to that of linear acridone derivatives containing only six&#8208;membered rings.

         <title>Directed Arylation of 7&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane to Prepare 3D Fragments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework via use of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Cleavage of the directing group provided the corresponding primary amides, which may be of value in drug discovery as &#8216;3D&#8217; fragments.







Abstract
Directed Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework is described. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Different minor diarylated side products were formed, depending on whether electron deficient aryl or pyridyl iodides were used as the coupling partners. Cleavage of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group provided small bridged compounds that may be of value in fragment based drug discovery.

Thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones were synthesized by the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis or the exclusion of air or moisture. The reaction is thought to exploit the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. A nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade gave the S&#8208;heterocyclic products in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.







Abstract
A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>Quinoline is one of the most important simple nitrogen heterocycles, being widespread in nature and present in a broad variety of pharmacologically active compounds. Specifically, quinoline is renowned antimalarial agents from several past decades and showed strong potential in this field. 3&#8208;Formyl&#8208;quinoline is a versatile precursor which transformed through the several easy methods into a wide range of biologically valuable scaffolds. The exploration of 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;quinoline gained much more attention to medicinal chemists in the field of drug discovery to design and synthesize new fused/tethered quinolines as potent therapeutical agents. The aim of this review, which covers the period from 2011 to 2023, is to update the role of formyl functionality of quinolines showing the extraordinary ability to play role in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of small heterocycles under neat mechanochemical conditions is of great interest in the field of drug design because most of the commercially available drugs contain at least one heterocyclic unit. The sodium borohydride (NaBH4) promoted reductive cyclization to fused dihydrofuran under grinding technique is one of the compendium additions for the clean future. The development of chemoselective reduction under silica&#8208;gel supported conditions represents significant progress in organic synthesis, offering a versatile and efficient method for selective reduction of specific functional groups within complex molecules. Synthesis of isoindole derivatives from the chemoselective reduce product via a sustainable short synthetic pathway is another significant process of our newly developed protocol.

         <title>Amide&#8208;derived Norbornadienes: Towards Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Systems in Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar energy harvesting is a promising alternative to the escalating energy demand. Among emerging technologies, MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems offer exciting avenues for solar fuel generation. However, their widespread application is partially hindered by the use of environmentally problematic and potentially hazardous organic non&#8208;polar solvents, such as toluene. Addressing this challenge, we here developed a series of four norbornadienes (NBDs) featuring symmetric amide substituents via functionalization of the readily available diacid substituted NBD. These compounds exhibit enhanced solubility in greener solvents like ethanol, a significant advancement over non&#8208;polar NBDs. Moreover, the reversible switching was demonstrated for three new NBDs through photoisomerization via UV&#8208;light absorption and to form QC and reversible catalysis via a commercial heterogeneous gold&#8208;based catalyst. By expanding the repertoire of environmentally benign solar fuel materials, this research contributes to the broader objective of sustainable energy generation and storage.</dc:description>

Among emerging technologies, MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems offer exciting avenues for solar fuel generation. However, their widespread application is partially hindered by the use of environmentally problematic and potentially hazardous organic non-polar solvents, such as toluene. Addressing this challenge, we here developed a series of four norbornadienes (NBDs) featuring symmetric amide substituents via functionalization of the readily available diacid substituted NBD. These compounds exhibit enhanced solubility in greener solvents like ethanol, a significant advancement over non-polar NBDs. Moreover, the reversible switching was demonstrated for three new NBDs through photoisomerization via UV-light absorption and to form QC and reversible catalysis via a commercial heterogeneous gold-based catalyst. By expanding the repertoire of environmentally benign solar fuel materials, this research contributes to the broader objective of sustainable energy generation and storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational and Electron Density Analysis of Bicyclo[3.1.0] hexanes:&#160;All Roads Lead to Boats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of the existence of an optimal conformation for molecular recognition and bearing in mind that nucleosides exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical properties, whereby their conformation has a key role in molecular recognition, the tendency of the pseudosugar moiety in carbanucleosides to adopt a boat&#8208;like conformation has been studied on the basis of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane system, resulting in versatile druglike scaffolds to increase molecular recognition. It is already known that using this system as a pseudosugar can fix the conformation in the northern or southern geometry required for biological activity, according to the relative position of the three&#8208;membered ring. By mapping their energy potential surface, we investigated the preference for boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. DFT was utilized alongside NBO analysis to explore the enhanced stability of boat&#8208;like conformers, also considering the influence of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms. Additionally, charge density distribution analysis using QTAIM identified key atoms contributing to stability changes. These findings will help to comprehend this behavior in the drug discovery process when conformationally restricted nucleosides are involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven [3+2] Cycloaddition of Triazine 1&#8208;Oxides with Arynes/Cyclooctyne: Access to Benzisoxazoles/Cyclooctene&#8208;Fused Isoxazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical and convenient method has been developed for the synthesis of a wide range of isoxazole based heterocycles having diverse functionality by cycloaddition reactions of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides with arynes and cyclooctyne.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;carboxylates of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with in&#8197;situ generated benzynes and naphthyne and also with cyclooctyne that, following extrusion of dinitrogen, form isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;propenoate derivatives in high yields and diastereocontrol. This practical method occurs at room temperature and provides a wide range of isoxazole&#8208;based heterocycles with diverse functionality. 1,2&#8208;Naphthyne, an unsymmetrical alkyne, forms only one regioisomeric product, exemplifying inherent regioselectivity. Although high, stereoselectivity is not 100&#8201;% in most cases, indicating that the loss of dinitrogen is stepwise. Derivative reactions of benzisoxazoles suggest their versatility.

6&#8208;Aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines were obtained from N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids using persulfate salt as oxidant via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical relay. Mechanism study suggests involvement of photoredox and energy transfer pathways.







Abstract
A diverse array of 6&#8208;aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines was successfully synthesized using easily obtainable N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids, facilitated by photoredox catalysis. A mechanistic investigation revealed that this methodology might involve both photoredox and energy transfer catalytic cycles, generating acyl radicals that subsequently promote radical relay cyclization.

         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of a series of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Ir(I) and Rh(I) complexes bearing the (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligand, coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion, was evaluated in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. The chelated mononuclear cationic complex [Ir(cod)(COC)]PF6&#160;(cod = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; COC = biscarbene ether) displayed the highest reaction rate for 4&#8208;pentynoic acid to form&#160;&#947;&#8208;methyl&#8208;ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (5&#8208;methylenedihydrofuran&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one). Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination.&#160;Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4&#8208;pentynoic acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols were synthesized using iodohydroxylation of gem&#8208;difluorinated allyl aryl ethers followed by epoxidation and ring&#8208;opening with an amine in a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step fashion. This approach allows the synthesis of a set of gem&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis of an array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols in a one&#8208;pot epoxidation/nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening via the corresponding iodohydrines is described. This methodology permits the construction of 1,1&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers in addition to unprecedented members of this compound class.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1 mol % of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Ring Closing Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Preparation of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the preparation of C4&#8208;functionalized proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane (Aba) amino acids by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis reaction of readily accessible dipeptide precursors.&#160;The reverse&#8208;turn inducing properties of the newly synthesized constrained dipeptide mimics were assessed bycomputational studies. Furthermore, the desired Aba derivatives, carrying a synthetically versatile diene moiety, were subjected to post&#8208;functionalization reactions to validate their potential application in peptide/peptidomimetic chemistry and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8210;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8208;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted&#160;asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative&#160;and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives.

         <title>Disrupting Substance Use Disorder: The Chemistry of Iboga Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iboga alkaloids are a family of monoterpene indole alkaloids first discovered from the root of Tabernanthe iboga. The major alkaloid constituent in the root, ibogaine, has garnered interest for its anti&#8208;addictive properties. Ibogaine has been shown to reduce opiate, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine self&#8208;administration in rodents. However, ibogaine itself is less than optimal as a treatment in humans for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD) due to its cardiotoxicity and hallucinogenic potential. Alternatively, it is an attractive lead for drug discovery efforts. Several notable programs have been launched to both elucidate ibogaine&#8217;s mechanism of action and reduce its toxicity. While there have been over twenty total syntheses of ibogamine, ibogaine, and closely related family members, there are far fewer syntheses of recently isolated iboga alkaloids. In this targeted review, we discuss the synthetic strategies applied to the synthesis of classical and non&#8208;classical iboga alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis reaction is a powerful method for the synthesis of a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now report on the development of a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed protocol for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction. Our studies revealed that methanol is a highly efficient solvent and that a very broad range of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support the proposed halogen&#8208;bond interaction. Furthermore, the halogen&#8208;bond protocol is compared with other available catalytic systems for these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Ring&#8208;Closing Reactions of Aminocyclohexane Derivatives Bearing Unsaturated Side Chains at C2: Stereocontrolled Approaches to cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;Fused Perhydro&#8208;indoles and &#8208;quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;protected cyclohexamines bearing acrylate residues attached at C2 have been investigated for their capacities to undergo base&#8208;promoted intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions. Three of these substrates do so both efficiently and completely diastereoselectively. Simple manipulation of the product perhydroindoles and decahydroquinolines afford ready access to novel analogues of the potent neurotoxin pumiliotoxin C.







Abstract
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;Ts&#8208;protected cyclohexylamines that incorporate an unsaturated side&#8208;chain at the C2 position have been prepared. Contrary to expectations, none of these underwent clean, photochemically&#8208;induced intramolecular hydroamination reactions to give the corresponding perhydro&#8208;indole or &#8208;quinoline. However, they did participate in efficient olefin cross metathesis (OCM) reactions with methyl crotonate. Three of the four acrylates so&#8208;formed engaged in base&#8208;promoted and completely diastereoselective, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition (cyclization) reactions to give the isomeric and C2&#8208;substituted perhydro&#8208;indoles or &#8208;quinolines with the structures of these being confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. DFT calculations generated results consistent with the observed diastereoselectivities and the proposed transition states. Manipulation of the ester groups associated with the cyclization products allowed for their conversion, inter alia, into the corresponding n&#8208;propyl residues and thus providing novel analogues of neurotoxic alkaloids such as pumiliotoxin C.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>I Bind It That Way &#8211; Bioorthogonal Unmasking of Profluorescent Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies for the bioorthogonally controlled generation of pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone&#8208;methides are presented here. The novel concept relies on a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit that chemically cages a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor. On a synthetically readily accessible model compound we demonstrate that IEDDA reaction of the tetrazine with a TCO leads to the liberation of a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide, which is readily captured by nearby nucleophiles to form a fluorescent scaffold. Unlike in previous approaches to access bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenic probes, where the tetrazine unit acted as a quencher of fluorescence, the role of the tetrazine is redefined here. Such repurposed role of tetrazines is foreseen to address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red / NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity is the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8211;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway.







Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8722;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et&#8197;al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.

This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013-2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three-membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a radical pathway. Reactions with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BiI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NaI, Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[I(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Py&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et&#8197;al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Difluorocarbene Enables Modular Synthesis of Difluoroalkylated Bicyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward method for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes (BCPs) from [1.1.1]propellane (TCP) through a stepwise procedure has been developed. This process involves nucleophilic addition of organozinc or ArMgBr rea&#8208;gents to TCP, followed by reaction with difluorocarbene to generate BCP substituted difluoroalkylzinc species, which subsequently couple with electrophiles, including allyl/propargyl bromides, (hetero)aryl disulfides, and proton, to provide a wide range of difluoroalkylated BCPs that otherwise are difficult to access through conventional methods. The transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility of this modular synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dichlorocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dichlorocarbonyl compounds were synthesized by facile dichlorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with TCIA&#8208;PPh3 and the resultant amides were converted to ketones. Conformational analyses of the products were performed to confirm our previous hypothesis regarding vicinal dichlorinated carbonyl compounds. The compounds exhibited 1H NMR signals with large coupling constants (7&#8208;11 Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;configuration and small coupling constants (3&#8208;4 Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;configuration. The syn&#8208;pentane interaction enabled rational conformational analysis of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dichlorinated carbonyl compounds, although some interesting exceptions were observed. Consideration of these conformations is helpful in assigning relative configurations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihalogenated carbonyl compounds in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocyanation of Non&#8208;Activated Alkenes Without Handling HCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrocyanation of alkenes can be considered a straightforward methodology that gives access to different functionalized organic chemistry entities. This is due to nitrile's high versatility, which can easily undergo further transformations. However, this process has traditionally employed hazardous hydrogen cyanide as the hydrocyanation agent. Therefore, in the last decades, different protocols have been developed to accomplish this key organic transformation without needing to handle HCN. In this review, we aim to gather the most recent works published in the last couple of decades regarding the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated olefins in the absence of gaseous hydrogen cyanide as nitrile source. In addition, special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanism working in each case.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of C&#8208;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates.

The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed.

[3,3] sigmatropic shift of these ones afforded the Diels Alder cycloadducts in quantitative yield.

         <title>Reconstructive Approach to the Regiospecific Synthesis of N9&#8208;Alkylated Purines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regiospecific synthesis of N9&#8208;alkylated purines as novel acyclic nucleosides was developed. This approach is based on reconstructive methodology involving the construction of a target heterocyclic scaffold on a readily available 5&#8208;aminotetrazole moiety, which is subsequently cleaved under reductive conditions due to azido&#8208;tetrazole tautomerism. It appeared that the rate of reduction for the azide fragment in 6&#8208;nitro&#8208;7&#8208;alkylaminotetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines is much greater than the rate of nitro group reduction. Treatment of these heterocycles with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst resulted in the formation of triaminopyrimidines in excellent yields through the reduction of both the azide and nitro group. Triaminopyrimidines were transformed into the desired N9&#8208;alkylated purines, and an analog of the marketed drug penciclovir was synthesized by the developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 3&#8208;Fluorocyclobutane Building Blocks for Organic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;monofluorinated cyclobutane building blocks was disclosed. In both cases, fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids were the key intermediates used to obtain all other derivatives, e.&#8201;g., amines, alcohols, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. For both target chemotypes, diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines were obtained through diastereomer separation. Characterization of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutyl substituents by pKa and LogP measurements for the model derivatives was also performed.







Abstract
Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.

         <title>Organocatalysis for enantioselective decarboxylative nucleophilic addition reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic decarboxylation of malonic acid half oxy&#8208; and thioesters, &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids, and their related compounds is a straightforward, powerful, and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the in&#8208;situ formation of enolates, which are important and well&#8208;studied synthons for various functional materials and natural products. This strategy, inspired by the biosynthesis of polyketides and fatty acids, is an attractive method for synthesizing enols from carboxyl compounds with less reactive &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms under mild conditions. In addition, these reactions are environmentally friendly and are of great interest to chemists because the use of a stoichiometric amount of base can be avoided, and the only byproduct is CO2. Thus far, remarkable progress has been made, especially in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions, allowing for the stereocontrolled formation of new C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;heteroatom, and C&#8211;X bonds. This review provides a comprehensive overview of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions and highlights the significant progress made since 2020. In particular, it focuses on chiral catalyst systems and transition states as key parameters for decarboxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalisation of Chromane by Deprotonative Metallation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the biological interest in chromane derivatives, few studies dedicated to the functionalisation of this heterocycle have been reported. Herein, our objective is to demonstrate the potential of alkali metal bases for the introduction of substituents at its positions 4 and 8, and to explain the observed reactivity based on quantum chemical calculations. Guided by these theoretical results, preliminary optimisation was carried out on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran before applying the optimal conditions to chromane. Deprotolithiation at C8 was thus achieved using n&#8208;butyllithium in hexane at room temperature, while functionalisation at C4 was promoted by a 1:1 mixture of lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide and potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8208;50 &#176;C. Various electrophiles were used to intercept the lithiated intermediates, providing a convenient access to substituted chromane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of the Solvent in the Synthesis of Spirocycles from Alkyne Cations Catalyzed by Triflic Acid: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of discrete solvent molecules in the reactivity of alkyne cations has been analyzed computationally. Analysis of the possible reaction mechanisms towards competitive cyclization and elimination processes including a molecule of solvent show the crucial role of dichloromethane (DCM) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). In the presence of DCM, a strong intramolecular p&#8208;cation interaction between the electrophilic center and the triple bond favors the [5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig] cyclization route, with no direct participation of the solvent in the reaction path. On the contrary, in the presence of a discrete molecule of THF, a strong solvent&#8211;cation interaction via formation of a dative C(+)&#8211;O(THF) bond drastically modifies the energy profile, thus promoting the elimination pathway.</dc:description>

A blue&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iron&#8208;catalyzed reduction of carboxamides and carboxylic esters leading to amines and alcohols, respectively, is reported conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2&#215;24&#8197;W, 450&#8211;460&#8197;nm) at ambient conditions in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes).







Abstract
We report herein a blue&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iron&#8208;catalyzed reduction of carboxamides and carboxylic esters. Conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2&#215;24&#8197;W, 450&#8211;460&#8197;nm) in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes), amines and alcohols were obtained, respectively, notably at ambient conditions, whereas using white light, higher reaction temperatures up to 100&#8201;&#176;C were required. Preliminary mechanism studies highlighted the crucial role of blue light not only to generate the catalytic active species, but also in some steps of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>

We established an improved synthetic route to TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups and also to longer alkyl chains. How the axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs, is herein explored.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8722;5.2&#8197;eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.&#8201;e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical enabled construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes via unprotected amide radical or radical anion. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.







Abstract
N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium Formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cesium formate mediated remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines were developed under mild reaction conditions in absence of external photocatalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the cesium formate act as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion and hydrogen atom donor.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in&#8197;situ generated aryl radical is converted to &#945;&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.

         <title>Phthalimide and 3&#8208;Formylindole Derivatives for Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Amide or Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalimide&#8208;hexyl or 3&#8208;formylindole&#8208;hexyl phosphoramidites and solid supports on a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane scaffold were used to introduce an amine or aldehyde function into oligonucleotides for conjugation by amide bond or oxime ligation.







Abstract
A phthalimide or 3&#8208;formylindole functionality was incorporated into a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (THME) scaffold, and the resulting compounds were subsequently transformed into phosphoramidites and solid supports. These building blocks were then used to synthesise oligonucleotides containing amine or aldehyde groups at various positions within their sequences. The resulting modified oligonucleotides were further conjugated through either amide bond formation or oxime ligation. These novel building blocks expand the repertoire of phosphoramidites and solid supports available for modifying oligonucleotides.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Silanes with SF6 for Efficient Synthesis of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of siloxanes via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of silanes with SF6 has been established, exhibiting broad substrate scope and high efficiency.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as distinctive oxidant and water as the oxygen source to transform silanes into siloxanes has been developed under mild conditions, realizing the efficient utilization and degradation of the strong greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, simultaneously. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, and it has been confirmed that the oxygen atoms in the resulting siloxanes indeed originate from water by isotopic labeling experiments with 18O.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation/Mumm Rearrangement towards Imides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize imides was reported. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We report an electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize the corresponding imides. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective oxidation of aliphatic carboxylic acids appears to be the key step in this transformation.
