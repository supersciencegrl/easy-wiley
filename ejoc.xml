         <title>Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Driven Formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) Cycloaddition of Enaminone&#8208;Based Thioalkynes with Nitriles to Form Thiazole Containing Bis&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;bond forming reactions in a single synthetic operation remain an attractive yet challenging transformation. Herein, one&#8208;pot synthesis of thiazole&#8208;containing dihydropyridone derivatives, driven by ring rearrangement and formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based alkynyl sulfide with nitrile, is reported. This protocol is operationally simple and features a wider substrate scope delivering medicinally relevant scaffold.

Herein, a one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;2(H)&#8208;one containing thiazole derivatives is reported by Bronsted acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;rearrangement and formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based thioalkyne with alkyl/aryl nitrile. The developed protocol demonstrates a wide substrate scope for both the reacting partners with high atom&#8208;economy furnishing very high to excellent yields of pharmaceutically relevant bis&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives. Based on outcome of the product and control experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further synthetic transformation demonstrate the synthetic efficacy and utility of the developed protocol.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Using Connon Type Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of alcohols mediated by Connon&#8208;type catalysts depends on electronic substituent effects rather than substrate or catalyst size.

Chiral pyridine derivatives following the general design principle proposed by Connon et al. are employed in the Lewis base mediated kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Variations in the size of substrates and catalyst substituents are found to impact reaction selectivity in a nonsystematic manner, while best selectivities are found for catalyst variants carrying electron&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted side chains. Solvent effects are found to be small for the most active and most selective catalysts studied, but more significant for less selective catalysts. The quantitative assessment of reaction kinetics points to a rather limited contribution of background acylation reactivity, but to a very significant temperature effect on reaction outcome.

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Sugar Frameworks by Quaternization of the Anomeric Carbon Atom</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel C,C and C,N bifunctional fucosides are stereoselectively obtained starting from a common anomeric bromide intermediate. The developed methodology expands the chemical space at the anomeric position of fucose and supports future applications in glycomimetics design.

The anomeric position of carbohydrates is a privileged site for structural diversification in the development of glycomimetics. Quaternization of the anomeric carbon represents a promising strategy to enable dual and orthogonal functionalization at C&#8208;1, while preserving critical binding features. Herein, the synthesis of novel bifunctional C&#8208;fucoside scaffolds, bearing a quaternary anomeric center, is reported. The strategy employs radical bromination of &#946;&#8208;cyano and &#946;&#8208;carbomethoxy fucosides to access key anomeric &#945; (axial) bromide intermediates, which enable downstream derivatization via azide substitution or C&#63743;C bond formation through radical allylation. The latter reaction occurs with high &#945; (axial) selectivity from the &#946;&#8208;carbomethoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fucosyl bromide, while mixtures are obtained from the corresponding &#946;&#8208;cyano derivative. Azide substitution occurs with full inversion of configuration starting from both bromides. While attempts at amide coupling are hampered by anomeric epimerization, copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition proceeds efficiently, yielding &#945;&#8208;C,&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;fucosides with high yields and selectivity. The developed methodology expands the chemical space at the anomeric position and supports future applications in ligand design, multivalent systems, and carbohydrate&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Advances in Organoboron&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article focuses on the advancements in utilizing boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. It highlights how these organocatalysts are being used to enhance the efficiency as well as the scope of regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation, a crucial process in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates.

The efficient and stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of complex glycans, while conventional chemical methods often involve metal&#8208;based catalysts and require harsh reaction conditions, which result in reduced chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and sometimes regiocontrol, particularly as chemical complexity in the substrates increases. In recent decades, organocatalysis has been a revolutionary approach, which offers sustainable and selective glycosylation strategies. Among the various organocatalysts explored, organoborons have demonstrated exceptional promise as mild and versatile activators of glycosylation reactions and for controlling the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This review highlights the recent advances in the use of boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. Herein, the focus is placed on their mechanistic roles as Lewis acids, their interactions with hydroxyl&#8208;containing substrates, and their ability to modulate regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Key contributions of boronic acids and organoboranes in promoting 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkages, activating various classes of glycosyl donors, and enabling regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformations under mild conditions are critically examined. It is divided into two main sections: the first part focuses on the highly Lewis&#8208;acidic borane B(C6F5)3 catalyzed glycosylation, and the second part discusses RB(OH)2&#8208;based glycosylation and its potential for future research.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Donors: Synergistic Optimization of Photovoltaic Properties in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
9&#8208;Fluorenone(FN) and benzothiadiazole units have become important building blocks for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their excellent charge transport prperties, strong electron affinity, and planar molecular structures. However, the 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;benzothiadiazole (FN&#8208;BT) system suffers from poor solubility and insufficient light absorption, limiting its photovoltaic performance. To overcome these challenges, three novel small&#8208;molecule donors (SMDs) are developed: two asymmetric (TPAFNBT and TPAFNDOBT) and one symmetric (TPAFN)2DOBT, based on their molecular framework. Side&#8208;chain modifications and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension are investigated the effect on device performance. The symmetric donor (TPAFN)2DOBT shows particularly promising properties, with extended absorption and an optical bandgap of 1.93 eV. The introcuced alkyl side chains significantly improved material processability and film quality. Notably, (TPAFN)2DOBT&#8208;based devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V coupled with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.25%, representing the highest efficiency reported for solution&#8208;processed FN&#8208;BT photovoltaic systems. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering through strategic side&#8208;chain design and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension can effectively enhance the performance of SMDs. These findings provide valuble design principles for developing advanced active layer materials in organic photovoltaic.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Dioxygenation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes to Generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers</title>

In this study, we report a mild and efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, preserving both fluorine atoms and resulting in the formation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This approach is operationally simple, utilizes inexpensive and widely available reagents, and showcases broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic investigations point to a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, which involves a concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.

A photoinduced radical cascade that does not require a photocatalyst or an oxidant has been developed for the convenient synthesis of difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones by the use of a difluoromethyl phenoxathiinium salt. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high yields, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

A mild photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced reaction for the convenient synthesis of difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones from N&#8208;allylbenzamides with a difluoromethyl phenoxathiinium salt (CF2H&#8208;PXT+) is presented, which involves a radical difluoromethylation/cyclization cascade process with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Using this method, a broad range of N&#8208;allylbenzamides are successfully converted to the desired difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones in good to high yields.

         <title>Facilitating the Isolation of Polar Natural Products: Mild 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole&#8208;Enabled Method for Derivatization of Acids and Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole, a relatively inexpensive reagent with inherently low toxicity, is utilized to activate polar natural products containing carboxylic acids and alcohols to enable the formation of less polar species (N&#8208;acylimidazoles and N&#8208;acyloxymidazoles). These intermediates are readily converted into methyl esters and carbonates by treatment with methanol.

Many secondary metabolites containing carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups are highly polar and can be difficult to purify and isolate from complex extracts obtained from natural sources. The conversion of these natural products to their corresponding alkyl esters/carbonates under mild conditions can simplify their purification and isolation. However, traditional derivatization methods have often relied on toxic and/ or corrosive reagents that can also lead to byproduct formation or epimerization in some instances.

These intermediates are readily converted into methyl esters and carbonates by treatment with methanol. It is anticipated that this rather simple and versatile derivatization method can facilitate the efficient isolation of secondary metabolites bearing polar carboxylic acid and alcohol residues.

         <title>Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkynylation of Cyclic Amines under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H alkynylation of cyclic amines is developed using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O as a photocatalyst and 1&#8208;bromoalkynes as coupling partners. The method enables the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkynes with moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer, and the protocol is scalable under mild photoredox conditions.

A direct visible&#8208;light &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkynylation of N&#8208;aryl pyrrolidine derivatives with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes has been developed, enabling the synthesis of propargylic amines. This transformation utilizes [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O as a photocatalyst, driven by blue LED (455&#8201;nm) irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry support the proposed reaction pathway, where the C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bond formation occurs via the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, followed by a radical coupling with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes. This approach offers a straightforward, efficient, and selective method for synthesizing a wide range of cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkynes, yielding moderate to good yields.

&lt;p&gt;A direct visible-light &#945;-C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bond alkynylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl pyrrolidine derivatives with 1-bromoalkynes has been developed, enabling the synthesis of propargylic amines. This transformation utilizes [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a photocatalyst, driven by blue LED (455&#8201;nm) irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry support the proposed reaction pathway, where the C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;) bond formation occurs via the oxidation of &#945;-amino radicals, followed by a radical coupling with 1-bromoalkynes. This approach offers a straightforward, efficient, and selective method for synthesizing a wide range of cyclic &#945;-aminoalkynes, yielding moderate to good yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyne&#8208;Dependent Synthesis of Pyrrolines and Propargylamines through Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free multicomponent decarboxylative reaction has been developed, enabling the highly regioselective and efficient synthesis of various pyrrolines and propargylamines. The approach is environmentally benign, readily implemented, and tolerates a wide range of functional groups.

Pyrrolines are crucial in the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals. Herein, a metal&#8208;free multicomponent decarboxylative reaction has been developed that is extremely effective and brief. The reaction is performed to form iminium salt intermediates through decarboxylative condensation of N&#8208;benzylglycines and formaldehyde. Subsequent chemoselective [3 + 2] cyclization or nucleophilic addition of alkynes leads to the generation of various pyrrolines or propargylamines in moderate to good yields, respectively. The approach is environmentally benign, easily implemented, and tolerates a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Green Synthesis of Hantzsch Dihydropyridines from Biorenewable Furans Derived from Lignocellulosic Biomass</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable methodology is developed for the synthesis of dihydropyridines from furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass, using p&#8208;sulfonic calix[4]arene as a catalyst and microwave irradiation heating. The reaction occurs in the absence of solvents, with short reaction time and satisfactory yields. Twenty one compounds are obtained, seven of which are reported for the first time. Catalyst reusability is demonstrated.

Hantzsch dihydropyridines constitute a class of N&#8208;heterocycles with significant pharmacological and technological applications. Due to their importance, the development of new sustainable synthetic methodologies for producing dihydropyridines is of great interest. This work presents the synthesis of dihydropyridines via the Hantzsch multicomponent reaction. Furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass are used as substrates, and p&#8208;sulfonic acid calix[4]arene (CX4SO3H) is employed as an organocatalyst, under microwave irradiation (MWI). The furanic compounds are reacted with ethyl acetoacetate and ammonium acetate in the presence of 1.0&#8201;mol% of CX4SO3H for 10&#8201;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C under MWI. Twenty one dihydropyridines are synthesized in yields ranging from 43% to 96%. Two dihydropyridines are obtained as crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and their crystallographic data are provided. Moreover, the catalytic system can be reused for seven reaction cycles without significant yield loss. The developed methodology offers numerous advantages. It enables the production of dihydropyridines from renewable substrates via a multicomponent reaction in a single step, with a short reaction time. The process uses a reusable organocatalyst and eliminates the need for solvents or metal catalysts.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Gramicidin S: How &#948;&#8208;Phenylproline Affects Turns and Interaction with Membrane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a phenyl group at the 5&#8208;cis position of proline in gramicidin S markedly alters its conformation. This substitution induces a double &#947;&#8208;turn that disrupts the native &#946;&#8208;sheet and hinders membrane insertion.

The incorporation of a phenyl ring at the 5&#8208;position of proline markedly influences the conformation and membrane interactions of gramicidin S. Herein, the structural and biophysical consequences of introducing cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline into gramicidin S are computationally investigated, with a particular focus on its conformational behavior and lipid bilayer interactions. Using a homochiral model dipeptide, it is shown that cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline promotes the formation of a double &#947;&#8208;turn, significantly altering the peptide's folding characteristics. This conformational bias is transferred to the modified gramicidin S scaffold, where it perturbs the native amphipathic balance and results in less favorable membrane interactions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of proline&#8208;derived modifications in shaping the structural and functional properties of cyclic peptides and offer valuable insights into how targeted substitutions can modulate peptide&#8211;membrane interactions.

         <title>Ecofriendly Borylation of Allylic Acetates via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Dual&#8208;Role Base Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A glovebox&#8208;free, scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of allylic acetates using cost&#8208;effective reagents and a recyclable ligand is presented. The reaction proceeds in EtOAc with a dual&#8208;role base, delivering a diverse range of allylic boronates in yields up to 97%.

Allylic boronates are valuable synthons in organic chemistry, making the development of efficient and sustainable preparation methods highly desirable. A nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation of unactivated allylic acetates using a recyclable N&#8208;donor ligand system in ethyl acetate is reported. The method employs an innovative dual&#8208;role base that simultaneously activates diboron reagents and reduces air&#8208;stable NiBr2, eliminating the need for external reductants. The approach shows excellent compatibility across a diverse array of substrates, delivering the desired products with isolated yields up to 97%. Its operational simplicity is evidenced by glovebox&#8208;free conditions and successful multigram&#8208;scale implementation (13&#8201;mmol scale, yields up to 95%), underscoring the method's practicality as a ecofriendly alternative to conventional allylic borylation.

         <title>Formal Higher&#8208;Order [8 + 3] Cycloaddition of Azaheptafulvenes with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal higher&#8208;order [8+3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes is developed to access cyclohepta[b]pyridines, exhibiting broad substrate accommodation. The nucleophilic cyclopropane ring opening is a key process of the [8+3] cycloaddition, and most probably proceeds via a &#8220;exploded&#8221; SN2 transition state with a high degree of carbocation character.

Cyclohepta[b]pyridine derivatives have attracted significant attention owing to their unique bioactivities. Herein, the authors describe an efficient method to access various cyclohepta[b]pyridine derivatives through formal higher&#8208;order [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes catalyzed by Yb(OTf)3. This method exhibits broad substrate accommodation and gives the corresponding products in high yields and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A formal higher-order [8+3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes is developed to access cyclohepta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridines, exhibiting broad substrate accommodation. The nucleophilic cyclopropane ring opening is a key process of the [8+3] cycloaddition, and most probably proceeds via a &#8220;exploded&#8221; S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;2 transition state with a high degree of carbocation character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclohepta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine derivatives have attracted significant attention owing to their unique bioactivities. Herein, the authors describe an efficient method to access various cyclohepta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine derivatives through formal higher-order [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes catalyzed by Yb(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This method exhibits broad substrate accommodation and gives the corresponding products in high yields and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Substituted 4&#8208;Pentafluorosulfanyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles has been developed. They are prepared using a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles.

This work reports the first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles. It describes 18 examples of 4&#8208;SF5&#8208;oxazoles with NMR yield ranging from 3% to 75%. While the isolation of the pure pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles proves challenging, the fluorinated heterocycles can nonetheless be obtained in yields between 14% and 52%, opening the door for their use as a novel fluorine&#8208;containing scaffold.

         <title>Reaction of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes: DFT Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones is investigated by DFT calculations to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The initial (3+2) cycloaddition delivers an unstable isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate, spontaneously rearranging to the 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one via a radical pathway. This study describes the successive reaction steps and shows how conformational and steric effects influence selectivity.

The reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones efficiently leads to 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The mechanism of this transformation is investigated theoretically to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The process begins with a (3+2) cycloaddition between the nitrone and the allene, delivering an isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate. This intermediate has never been isolated; it spontaneously rearranges to the final 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one via homolytic cleavage of the N&#63743;O bond, followed by rotation and C&#63743;N recombination of the biradical intermediate. The computational results provide valuable insights for achieving diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones through careful selection of substituents on the nitrone and allene.

         <title>Synthesis of Amphiphilic Naphthalenediimides and Investigation of their Bioimaging Potential in Large Unilamellar Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of a small library of nonsymmetrical panchromatic naphthalenediimides is reported. The electron&#8208;donating groups on the aromatic core are varied to tune the fluorophores' photophysical properties . The ability of the dyes to partition and light up inside the lipid bilayer membrane in liposomal models is investigated to evaluate key features for designing compact tracers for cell membrane staining.

New fluorescent probes for bioimaging outlook are constantly required to in&#8208;depth elucidate relevant biochemical processes and macrodomains. Among them, the targeted imaging of cellular membranes is of high importance due to their complex biochemical function. In this work, a small library of amphiphilic core&#8208;substituted 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimides (cNDIs) has been synthesized and investigated. This approach aims to evaluate how fluorophores with the same molecular structure and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance but bearing different small structural moieties, needed to tune their optical features, can stain the lipid bilayer membrane in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as cell membrane models. The photophysical properties and the partition kinetic into different LUVs have been analyzed with respect to the probe structure and the specific photophysical traits related to cNDIs core substitution spanning the whole visible spectrum. The obtained results and preliminary cell imaging analyses represent versatile key data to support the design of new amphiphilic fluorescent sensors for bioimaging.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinone using tetrafluoroboric acid under thermal and photochemical conditions.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones using tetrafluoroboric acid. The reactions proceed under mild thermal conditions, providing a wide range of functionalized 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides in 65%&#8211;80% yields. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds with 58%&#8211;63% yields at room temperature under visible light using blue LED conditions. Simple operation, metal&#8208;free conditions, and broad substrate scope are the benefits of the developed methodology.

         <dc:description>
Four rhodanine&#8208;derived conjugated systems, incorporating N,N&#8208;diphenylamine and extended with furan or thiophene, undergo glycosylation at the rhodanine nitrogen atom with yields up to 49% in 5 steps. The optoelectronic properties remain unaffected by the presence of glucose. Devices fabricated using the synthesized materials blended with PC71BM in a bulk heterojunction configuration clearly exhibit a photovoltaic effect.

Rhodanine&#8208;derived conjugated systems, incorporating N,N&#8208;diphenylamine and extended with either furan or thiophene, are glycosylated through the nitrogen atom of the rhodanine ring. The optoelectronic properties of these dyes are investigated, revealing that the presence of glucose does not negatively impact their beneficial properties. Additionally, solar cells are built using these systems, demonstrating their photovoltaic capabilities.

The Front Cover, inspired by rural India, symbolizes the work presented by J. Kandasamy and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202500375). Energised by the sun, coconuts (starting material) fall from the tree, causing the birds to fly away (denitrogenation). In the pool (acetic acid), the water from the mountain stream (fluoride ions from HBF4) causes the coconuts to sprout (transformation into the product).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#9472;S Bond Formation Catalyzed by the Organic Photocatalyst Eosin Y</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the formation of C&#9472;S bonds promoted by organic photosensitizer eosin Y under visible light has attracted great interest and attention among chemists. This article reviews the research results on the formation of C&#9472;S bond promoted by organic photocatalyst eosin Y under visible light since 2015, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

The development of green and efficient C&#9472;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C&#9472;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Multistep Reactions Initiated by Amine&#8208;Based Organometallic Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of C&#8211;H activation and other organometallic methodologies making use of transient directing groups or free amines themselves for the elaboration of amine substrates provides unique access to cascade&#8208;type reactions that can generate significant molecular complexity in one pot.

The pursuit of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical pathways to access complex heterocycles and functionalized scaffolds has driven advances in the use of transient and free amine directing groups that exploit native coordination properties for multistep synthesis. Traditional protection&#8208;functionalization&#8208;deprotection sequences, while effective in some circumstances, introduce inefficiencies that compound across multistep syntheses. The following strategies address three critical challenges: 1) eliminating auxiliary installation/removal, 2) enabling multistep functionalization without intermediate isolation (in many cases), and 3) maintaining compatibility with sensitive functional groups. This review aims to collectively summarize the developments in amine&#8208;based synthesis that make use of the amine both as a directing group and a reactive partner in subsequent reaction steps. By analyzing mechanistic insights and substrate scope limitations across these methodologies, one can identify unresolved challenges and provide insight on future directions.

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Halides with Secondary Phosphine Oxides under Solvent&#8208;Free Conditions for the Synthesis of Tertiary Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the green and efficient synthesis of tertiary phosphine oxides, possible self&#8208;induced side reactions can be avoided by replacing trivalent phosphorus esters with secondary phosphine oxides. The resulting transformation has clear advantages over conventional Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reactions.

The development of a metal&#8208;free Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction for green and efficient construction of C&#63743;P(V) compounds represents a significant advancement in organophosphorus synthesis. Herein, a nucleophilic substitution strategy between alkyl halides and secondary phosphine oxides under solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions is reported, using sodium iodide as the catalytic promoter. This method provides a facile operation for the synthesis of diverse tertiary phosphine oxides with significant advantages. Firstly, the reaction exhibits broad substrate compatibility, covering a range of aliphatic halides and phosphorus nucleophiles. Secondly, it can be scaled up to the gram level without sacrificing efficiency, and the reaction pathway clearly established through rational studies. Particularly noteworthy is the complete elimination of transition metal catalysts and organic solvents, which aligns with the principles of green chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids by Iron Catalysis for the Construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O Bonds under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven decarboxylative strategy has been developed for C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation. This method features broad substrate scope, mild conditions amenable to gram&#8208;scale reactions, and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.

The facile construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O bonds holds significant importance in organic synthesis. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids is reported, enabling C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation through the trapping of generated alkyl radicals with TEMPO. This method is characterized by its low cost, broad substrate compatibility, and operational simplicity. Not only does it provides an efficient approach to C(sp3)&#63743;O bond construction, but also it demonstrates potential applications in synthetic chemistry through subsequent modifications of TEMPO derivatives.

This method features broad substrate scope, mild conditions amenable to gram-scale reactions, and potential for late-stage functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facile construction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bonds holds significant importance in organic synthesis. Herein, a visible-light-driven iron-catalyzed decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids is reported, enabling C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond formation through the trapping of generated alkyl radicals with TEMPO. This method is characterized by its low cost, broad substrate compatibility, and operational simplicity. Not only does it provides an efficient approach to C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond construction, but also it demonstrates potential applications in synthetic chemistry through subsequent modifications of TEMPO derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling: A Strategy for C&#63743;C Bond Formation between Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review divulged the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of halo or pseudohalides to synthesize biaryls and substituted aryls, eliminating the need for preformed organometallic reagents.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for selectively forming carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds from two distinct electrophiles. This approach eliminates the need for preformed organometallic reagents by utilizing in&#8201;situ reduction to generate reactive intermediates under mild conditions while enhancing functional group tolerance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in palladium&#8208;catalyzed XEC transformations, highlighting novel strategies, mechanistic insights, ligand and catalyst design, substrate scope, and synthetic applications. Additionally, current challenges and future directions in this fast&#8208;progressing field, aiming to inspire further innovation in sustainable catalysis are discussed.

2&#8208;Fluoropyrroles are synthesized via the [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines with difluorocarbene, generated in&#8201;situ from trimethylsilyl 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)acetate (TFDA). The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines are treated with TFDA in the presence of a Proton Sponge catalyst. The resulting difluorocarbene underwent [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] cycloaddition, yielding 5,5&#8208;difluoropyrrolines, whose dehydrofluorination with 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]&#8208;7&#8208;undecene produced the desired products.

2&#8208;Fluoropyrroles are synthesized via the [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines with difluorocarbene (:CF2), which is generated in&#8201;situ from trimethylsilyl 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)acetate (TFDA). The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines are treated with TFDA in the presence of a Proton Sponge catalyst, facilitating the catalytic generation of: CF2. The resulting carbene underwent [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] cycloaddition with imines through azomethine ylide intermediates, yielding 5,5&#8208;difluoropyrrolines.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Dimethylalkyl Methyl Ethers, Important Components of the Epicuticular Wax of Spiders</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;chain dimethyl&#8208;branched aliphatic methyl ethers are key components of spiders&#8217; epicuticular and web lipids. Evaluating different strategies for their synthesis, it is found that the late introduction of the methyl groups via alkynyl mesylate substitutions and hydrogenation gives faster and cleaner access to such target compounds compared to other approaches using, for example, Negishi coupling.

Long&#8208;chain methyl&#8208;branched alkyl methyl ethers are essential constituents of the cuticle of many spiders, regulating water balance and transporting chemical signals used in species recognition. The synthesis of such compounds, or related hydrocarbons found in insects, is usually time&#8208;consuming and not very efficient, mainly due to the long alkyl chains involved. Herein, new strategies for synthesizing such compounds are evaluated. Negishi sp2&#8211;sp3 coupling reactions are first investigated and proceed with yields of 50&#8211;70%, even with very long alkyl chains. However, such approaches require the synthesis of vinyl iodides, adding additional steps. While the methyl branches are created early in these syntheses, a late introduction strategy proves more favorable. To facilitate this, chain construction is achieved through the addition of an alkynyl anion to aldehydes, resulting in internal propargyl alcohols that serve as substrates for nucleophilic methylation. Iron&#8208;catalyzed methyl Grignard addition yields methylallyl alcohols, which are subsequently converted into the target compounds through hydrogenation and alcohol defunctionalization. Although this approach is successful for compounds with medium chain length, it fails for very long compounds. Instead, allene formation by nucleophilic addition of the methyl group to propargyl mesylates, followed by hydrogenation, gives good yields and clean target ethers.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Based Photoswitches in Catalysis: Recent Developments and Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable catalysis offers remote, precise control over catalytic activity. This review covers advancements in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based photoswitchable catalysts, highlighting developments from their first report in 2009 to now .

Using light as an external stimulus, photoswitchable catalysis offers attractive opportunities to modulate the activity and selectivity of catalytic systems on demand and remotely, with high spatial and temporal precision. Consequently, the development of photoswitchable catalysts has attracted considerable attention from the chemist community in recent decades, leading to various photoresponsive species with diverse properties. Among these, only a few examples incorporate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), despite their unique electronic and steric properties and their ubiquity in organic and organometallic catalysis. This review highlights recent advances in this emerging research area from the first reported species in 2009 to the present day, with particular emphasis on the synthesis of photoswitchable NHCs and their corresponding transition metal complexes for application in catalysis. Future perspectives in the field are also discussed.

         <title>Novel 3H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Dithiaphosphole and Unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;Dithiadiphosphinane Heterocycles: Unanticipated Cyclization Reactions of Lawesson's Reagent and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles of novel types A and B are obtained by reaction of Lawesson's reagent with electron&#8208;rich alkynes. Two compounds are characterized crystallographically, and the mechanisms of their formation are discussed based on DFT calculations. 

The treatment of Lawesson's reagent with selected alkyl or aryl alkynes results in the formation of cyclization products such as 3H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;dithiaphosphole&#8208;3&#8208;sulfide or unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiphosphinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;disulfide derivatives. The new heterocycles are characterized spectroscopically and in two cases by crystal structure analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) computations (PW6B95D3/6&#8208;311&#8201;+&#8201;G(d,p)&#8208;PCM(toluene)//B97D3/6&#8208;31&#8201;G*) explain the formation of the dithiaphosphole product from alkynes and Lawesson's reagent via a sequence of [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] addition, electrocyclic ring opening, S&#63743;S bond forming ring closure, and P(III) oxidation by sulfur transfer from Lawesson's reagent. Based on DFT calculations, the formation of a 1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiphosphinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;disulfide is rationalized by a sequence of cyclization, electrocyclic ring opening, and dipolar cyclization steps.

         <title>Synthesis of Rare&#8208;Bacterial Sugar Analogs: Thomosamine and Fluorinated Thomosamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of protected thomosamine (4&#8208;amino&#8208;4,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose), 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;thomosamine, and 2,3&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;thomosamine from levoglucosan (1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranose).

Bacterial carbohydrates that include unusual deoxy amino sugars represent interesting targets in drug discovery. The chemical synthesis of such probes and fluorinated analogs is a challenge that needs to be addressed. In this work, a novel approach to thomosamine (4&#8208;amino&#8208;4,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose (d&#8208;Fucp4N)) and fluorinated thomosamines from levoglucosan (1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranose) is developed. The key steps involve the introduction of the C4 amino on 1,6&#8208;anhydro bridged intermediates and the subsequent C6 reduction. Thomosamine, 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;thomosamine, and 2,3&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;thomosamine are accessed as their protected form with a thiophenyl group at the anomeric position.

         <title>Rational Control of C&#8211;N Axial Chirality in Bis&#8208;Pentatomic N&#8208;Pyrazolyl Maleimides through an Experimental and Computational Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The configurational stability of a series of axially chiral bis&#8208;pentatomic compounds of the N&#8208;pyrazolyl maleimide scaffold has been investigated through a combined theoretical and experimental approach. The experimental values of the barriers to enantiomerisation of the title compounds are determined through dynamic high performance liquid chromatograpgy, validating the theoretical predictions by density functional theory computations and the applicability of the computational approach.

The control of axial chirality in atropisomeric compounds has gained significant importance in modern synthetic chemistry due to their relevance in the design of materials and biologically active molecules. The study investigates the configurational stability of a series of axially chiral N&#8208;pyrazolyl maleimides through a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Initially, density functional theory (DFT) computations are used to predict the corresponding barriers to enantiomerisation of multiple derivatives holding a large variety of substituents at different positions of both heterocyclic nuclei on either side of the C&#63743;N bond. Then, the predicted barriers are validated through dynamic chiral high performance liquid chromatography analysis, providing experimental evidence for the configurational stability of these challenging bis&#8208;pentatomic C&#8211;N atropisomers. Compounds featuring a 1&#8208;N&#8208;t&#8208;butyl group as well as a C&#8208;4&#8208;substituent on the aminopyrazole ring exhibit high barriers to enantiomerisation, confirming their potential as a new family of atropisomerically stable heterocyclic compounds. Variation of the substitution on the maleimide nucleus has no significant influence on the overall configurational stability. The good correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental findings highlights the strength of the DFT computations in predicting configurational stability of chiral N&#8208;pyrazolyl maleimides, providing a predictive framework for designing new atropisomeric N&#8208;pyrazolyl maleimides with restricted rotation around the C&#63743;N bond.

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Synthesis of Dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]Coumarins and Pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]Coumarins</title>

         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;selective divergent approach for construction of trans&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins through a metal&#8208;free oxidative coupling and cyclocondensation is described. In addition, a pathway to furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin is disclosed. Control experiments reveal a radical pathway for oxidative coupling, and density functional theory calculations offer an insight into the preferential formation of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins in MeCN.

This study has developed a chemodivergent protocol for synthesizing furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins from easily accessible reagents through oxidative cyclization and condensation reaction, respectively. A library of dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins is synthesized by just tuning the reaction conditions. Moreover, furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin can be synthesized through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step approach. High chemoselectivity is observed in the case of formation of dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins. Mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, operational simplicity, use of inexpensive catalyst, broad functional group tolerance, and practicability are the important facets of this strategy. Detailed mechanistic investigation indicates the radical pathway for oxidative cyclization. Whereas, theoretical studies show that the greater electrophilicity of the carbonyl group in acetonitrile is responsible for the preferential formation of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]chromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Cycloaddition Strategy for the Synthesis of Carbon Substituted 1, 4&#8208; Piperazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work involves in situ generation of 1, 3 dipoles and their [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] cycloaddition catalyzed by iodine in water to synthesize carbon substituted 1, 4&#8208;piperazines from easily available starting materials. This synthetic pathway is free from metal, cautious imine synthesis, and diamine precursor.

Piperazine moiety is found to be the most promising core in several biologically active compounds and some of the marketed blockbuster drugs such as Glivec (imatinib) and Viagra (sildenafil). However, the substitution pattern in the piperazine ring reveals that the synthesis of carbon substituted scaffold remains a challenge without prefunctionalized piperazine core. Herein, a straightforward, catalytic, one pot, metal&#8208;free, benign synthetic route is disclosed to synthesize carbon substituted 1, 4&#8208;piperazines from easily available starting materials. This synthetic pathway is free from cautious imine synthesis and previously reported well&#8208;articulated starting material which are leading to limited substrate scope. The approach involves in situ generation of 1, 3 dipoles and their [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] cycloaddition catalyzed by iodine in water.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Four&#8208;Component Strategy to Access Thioether&#8208;Derived Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and Imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique four&#8208;component approach for constructing imidazole motifs and enabling sulfuration from simple chemical feedstocks leads to a diverse range of thioether&#8208;derived imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

A metal&#8208;free construction of thioether&#8208;derived imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles holds significant potential in medicinal chemistry. However, the exploration of multicomponent synthesis using simple chemical feedstocks has not been thoroughly investigated. A new four&#8208;component strategy involving base&#8208;mediated annulation and I2&#8208;promoted sulfenylation has been developed, utilizing readily accessible &#945;&#8208;bromoketones, 2&#8208;aminopyridines, and alkyl bromides, with sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3.5H2O) serving as the sulfur source. Consequently, this approach effectively produces a series of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;derived thioethers in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields, showcasing a wide substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and compatibility. Furthermore, the multicomponent protocol has been successfully extended to synthesize sulfenyl&#8208;derived imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles in acceptable yields using the corresponding 2&#8208;aminothiazole. Importantly, metal&#8208;free multicomponent reactions have been successfully employed on a Gram scale in open air, and a plausible mechanism has also been proposed based on existing results.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of S&#8208;Aryl Dithiocarbamates via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex Using Arylselenonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light driven one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions of aryl selenonium salts, CS2, and amines for preparation of S&#8208;aryl dithiocarbamates has been developed.

A multicomponent reaction for the efficient synthesis of S&#8208;aryl dithiocarbamates from arylselenonium salts, CS2, and amines under visible light irradiation is demonstrated. This protocol enables straightforward construction of C(sp2)&#63743;S bonds via C&#63743;Se bond cleavage and allows the synthesis of diverse aryl sulfides. This three&#8208;component process proceeds without any photocatalyst, exogenous single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) mediator, or additional oxidant. Remarkably, this developed strategy exhibits the advantages of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity. Furthermore, the byproduct dibenzoselenophene can be recovered to provide new arylselenonium salts. Mechanistic studies support the method involving a photoinduced EDA complex.

     alt="Visible Light-Induced Three-Component Synthesis of S-Aryl Dithiocarbamates via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex Using Arylselenonium Salts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel visible-light driven one-pot multicomponent reactions of aryl selenonium salts, CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and amines for preparation of S-aryl dithiocarbamates has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multicomponent reaction for the efficient synthesis of S-aryl dithiocarbamates from arylselenonium salts, CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and amines under visible light irradiation is demonstrated. This protocol enables straightforward construction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S bonds via C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Se bond cleavage and allows the synthesis of diverse aryl sulfides. This three-component process proceeds without any photocatalyst, exogenous single-electron transfer (SET) mediator, or additional oxidant. Remarkably, this developed strategy exhibits the advantages of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity. Furthermore, the byproduct dibenzoselenophene can be recovered to provide new arylselenonium salts. Mechanistic studies support the method involving a photoinduced EDA complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Unsymmetrical 3,3&#8208;Diarylpropenals by a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction of (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Chloropropenal Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient Suzuki coupling&#8208;type procedure is developed to stereospecifically prepare unsymmetrical 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yield. Mild oxidation of the 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenoic acids and further lactonization to form 4&#8208;arylcoumarins have been achieved. A variety of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins are synthesized via this route with excellent stereochemical purity.

Using (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals, this study has developed an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yield with very good retention of stereochemistry. Consequently, this study has found an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenoic acids, which are precursors to 4&#8208;arylcoumarins. The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals with arylboronic acid derivatives yields unsymmetric 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yields with excellent retention of stereochemistry. These 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals are then oxidized to the corresponding acrylic acids and lactonized to form 4&#8208;arylcoumarins. The lactonization reaction consistently occurs with the aryl group that is cis to the acid group, that is, with the aryl group that is introduced in the Suzuki coupling step. Thus, the stereochemical retention of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling step results in the ability to make a diverse catalog of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins with complete stereoselective control. A variety of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins are synthesized via this route with several different aryl substituents giving good yields and excellent stereochemical purity.

         <title>A Chiron Approach to the Practical and Scalable Synthesis of the &#946;3&#8208;Adrenergic Receptor Agonist Vibegron</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable chiral&#8208;pool&#8208;based synthesis of Vibegron is reported that utilizes 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;D&#8208;phenylalanine and R&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid as starting materials. The approach offers a concise and stereoselective alternative to conventional asymmetric Evans aldol and dynamic kinetic resolution methods.

A practical and scalable synthesis of the &#946;3&#8208;adrenergic receptor agonist Vibegron has been developed using a streamlined chiral&#8208;pool approach from readily available 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;D&#8208;phenylalanine and (R)&#8208;mandelic acid. The synthesis features a key acid&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;acyl iminium ion cyclization followed by a highly diastereoselective reduction, enabling efficient construction of the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidine core. Final amidation with a commercially available pyrrolopyrimidine sodium salt furnished Vibegron in excellent overall yield.

A ligand&#8208;free CuTC&#8208;catalyzed allenylative C&#63743;P coupling reaction of propargylic acetates with H&#8208;phosphine oxides to yield allenylphosphine oxides is reported, with scope and mechanism discussed.

The extra&#8208;ligand&#8208;free CuTC&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;P cross coupling reaction of propargylic acetates with H&#8208;phosphine oxides is reported to afford allenylphosphine oxides. The reaction took place efficiently with diphenylphosphine oxide and electron&#8208;deficient di(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)phosphine oxide, but less effectively with electron&#8208;rich ones such as di(4&#8208;methoxylphenyl)phosphine oxide and dialkylphosphine oxides.

A concise approach for the efficient synthesis of the [6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;3] B&#8208;D&#8208;E&#8208;F tetracyclic core of cryptotrione was developed. Key reactions include a transannular aldol reaction followed by an RCM reaction to forge the [6&#8208;5&#8208;5] B&#8208;D&#8208;E tricyclic core and a diastereoselective cyclopropanation to assemble the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane motif with a side chain.

Cryptotrione, a potent anticancer and structurally complex C35 terpene belonging to the cryptoquinonemethide family, has an unprecedented [6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;3] hexacyclic skeleton with a strained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane core and [5&#8208;5] spirocyclic moiety. Herein, a concise approach for the synthesis of the [6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;3] B&#8208;D&#8208;E&#8208;F tetracyclic core of cryptotrione without protecting groups is described. The unusual [6&#8208;5&#8208;5] B&#8208;D&#8208;E tricyclic core including a spiro all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, found in cryptotrione as well as other cryptoquinonemethides, was efficiently constructed by a transannular aldol reaction followed by an RCM reaction. A substrate&#8208;controlled diastereoselective cyclopropanation was used to forge the strained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane motif with a side chain.

         <title>Photoinduced Cascade Cyclization of Ortho&#8208;Alkynylanilines to Access Dithiocyanated or Selenocyanated Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse indole derivatives are obtained by a cascade process involving dithiocyanation or selenocyanation and cyclization of ortho&#8208;alkynylanilines under mild conditions with NH4SCN/KSeCN. Experiments are undertaken to shed light on the radical reaction mechanism and investigate the versatility of the transformation.

A photoinduced cyclization and dithiocyanation/selenocyanation of ortho&#8208;alkynylanilines with NH4SCN/KSeCN provide various dithiocyanated and selenocyanated indoles. The structure of the indole framework is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, a series of experiments investigating scale&#8208;up, other starting materials, and radical inhibition/capture are carried out to study the application and reaction process of this cascade system.

         <title>Toward the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Difluoro Deaminated Sialic Acid (C3DFKDN)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of protected C3&#8208;difluoro KDN (C3DFKDN), an unnatural derivative of the sialic acid member, KDN, and key building block for KDN&#8208;based chemical probes, is reported. Its 12&#8208;step synthetic route starts from commercially available methyl d&#8208;mannopyranoside and key steps include a Reformatsky reaction with ethyl bromodifluoroacetate, alkylation with ethyl vinyl ether, and ozonolysis of a terminal double bond.

2&#8208;Keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;nononic acid (KDN) is a nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharide of the sialic acid family. As a deaminated analogue of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), KDN features a hydroxyl group at C5 instead of an amine. Although present at low levels in mammalian tissues, KDN is abundant in certain tumor cells and pathogens, making it and its processing enzymes attractive targets for understanding biological functions and developing potential therapeutics. Fluorinated carbohydrate derivatives are widely used to probe and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes). This report describes the first total synthesis of 3,3&#8208;difluoro KDN (C3DFKDN), a novel fluorinated sialic acid derivative and a key intermediate for designing covalent inhibitors and activity&#8208;based probes targeting KDN&#8208;processing enzymes. Introduction of a C3&#8208;difluoro group prevents elimination side reactions common with monofluorinated sialic acid analogues. Two synthetic strategies are explored: 1) Coupling a pyranose precursor with a difluorinated alkyne bromide followed by oxidation and 2) incorporation of a difluoroacetate building block via a Reformatsky&#8208;type reaction. The latter approach proves more effective, affording protected C3DFKDN in an overall yield of 3.7% over 12 steps from methyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside. This work establishes methodology for the synthesis of C3&#8208;difluorinated sialic acids and provides a foundation for developing fluorinated probes and inhibitors of KDN&#8208;related enzymatic pathways.

         <title>Introduction of Structural Diversity at the C2 Position of Unsaturated Iminosugars through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the structural diversity of iminosugars at the C2 position, protected 2&#8208;iodoiminoglycals, efficiently synthesized from sugar lactams, are subjected to mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Successful aminocarbonylation, arylation, and phosphonylation provide a range of C2&#8208;functionalized iminoglycals, which, once O&#8208;deprotected, are tested as glycosidase inhibitors.

To vary the functionality of iminosugars at the C2 position, protected 2&#8208;iodoiminoglycals in the D&#8208;gluco, D&#8208;galacto, and D&#8208;xylo series are efficiently synthesized from sugar lactams. Their mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, arylation, and phosphonylation are successful and provide a range of C2&#8208;functionalized iminoglycals in good yields. Two of these compounds are O&#8208;deprotected to afford 1,2&#8208;unsaturated iminosugars that prove to be modest inhibitors of glycosidases.

Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>ONO&#8211;Cobalt Catalyzed Reduction of Sulfoxides to Sulfides with Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) as the Deoxygenation Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reduction of sulfoxides to sulfides is developed with poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) as the reductant. Under optimized conditions, turnover numbers of up to 7200 are observed.

Herein the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reduction of sulfoxides to sulfides with a well&#8208;defined tridentate tetrahydroquinolin&#8208;8&#8208;one&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (ONO)&#8211;cobalt complex as the precatalyst is reported. Inexpensive poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) is used as the reductant. This newly developed catalytic system is applied successfully to a broad range of substrates, including diaryl, aryl alkyl, and dialkyl sulfoxides as well as cyclic sulfoxides, and accordingly delivered diverse sulfides in high yields. Importantly, turnover numbers up to 7200 are achieved with this protocol.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane (BIM) derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This electrochemical approach, characterized by simple and mild reaction conditions, provides an operationally straightforward and practically applicable route to valuable indole derivatives, utilizing readily available raw materials.

An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane (BIM) derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This developed approach is effective for aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes, which react with a range of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor indoles to produce the desired BIMs in good to excellent yields. Additionally, a potential antiobesity drug is also successfully synthesized with various indole derivatives under the influence of an electric current, and the transformation of BIMs demonstrates the application potential of this protocol.

         <title>Photoredox Decarboxylative 3&#8208;Fluoroallylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative 3&#8208;fluoroallylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has been developed to produce fluorinated homoallylamines. A broad reaction scope is reported, including the use of dipeptides and different protecting groups on nitrogen.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient, photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative 3-fluoroallylation of &#945;-amino acids has been developed to produce fluorinated homoallylamines. A broad reaction scope is reported, including the use of dipeptides and different protecting groups on nitrogen. Further manipulation of products suggests the potential for late-stage functionalization toward the synthesis of monofluoroalkene-containing molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused tricyclic compounds, prepared from 1&#8208;(&#969;&#8208;azidoalkyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes, undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with 2&#8208;nitrobenzeneboronic acids, followed by triphenylphosphine treatment, yielding diverse fluorescent pentacyclic compounds incorporating triazole rings.

By heating 1&#8208;(&#969;&#8208;azidoalkyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes in DMF, intramolecular Huisgen cycloaddition between the azido group and the 1,1&#8208;dihalovinyl moiety proceeds smoothly to afford 5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused tricyclic benzocondensed compounds. Leveraging the remaining halogen groups, the carbon chain extension via the Mizoroki&#8211;Heck or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, followed by an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, furnish polycyclic systems that incorporate fused triazole rings. Furthermore, the transformation of the halogen groups into the 2&#8208;nitrobenzene derivatives via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, followed by a Cadogan reaction using triphenylphosphine, provides a series of fluorescent pentacyclic compounds.

         <title>Decarboxylative Michael Additions of Substituted Malonic Acid Half&#8208;Oxyesters to Methylidene Malonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted malonic acid half oxyesters reacted with alkylidene malonates in a fast, efficient decarboxylative Michael addition, delivering adducts in high yields. The reaction occurred in bulk solvent, open to air, needing only a weak amine base as an organocatalyst to drive a mechanism involving addition prior to decarboxylation.

Decarboxylative Michael additions between substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) and methylidene malonates have been achieved using either a catalytic amount of a weak base such as N&#8208;methyl&#8208;morpholine or di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylamine in a refluxing solvent. This transformation occurs under practical conditions (bulk solvent and open to air) and can be performed with various SMAHOs and methylidene malonates, in yields ranging from 22 to 89%. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), studies support the occurrence of a Michael addition pre&#8208;decarboxylation mechanism.

         <title>Luminescent Click&#8208;Pyrenyl Nucleosides: as Novel Building Blocks for Nucleic Acids: Synthesis, Photophysics, Confocal Microscopy Studies, and Oligonucleotide Conjugation</title>

Dinucleoside phosphate analogues with a luminescent pyrenyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;N&#8208;(triazole)2 linker substituting the natural phosphodiester linkage are obtained by the CuAAC reaction. Representative dinucleoside is conjugated to the deoxyribonucleotide 5&#8217;&#8208;d(TTT CTT TCC CTC)&#8208;3&#8242;. The resulting conjugate remains capable of forming a stable B&#8208;type DNA duplex with a complementary oligonucleotide strand.

Three artificial dinucleoside phosphate analogues with a pyrenyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;N&#8208;(triazole)2 linker substituting the natural phosphodiester linkage are reported. These novel compounds are prepared by the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC) of a suitably designed pyrenyl&#8208;dialkyne with 3&#8242;&#8208;azido thymidine and 5&#8242;&#8208;azido adenosine building blocks, respectively. The pyrenyl chromophore confers luminescent properties to these dinucleosides. In diluted dichloromethane (DCM) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions, the compounds show structured fluorescence emission in the blue region of the spectrum, while at higher concentrations or in the solid state, a featureless and broad excimer emission with &#955;em&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;470&#8201;nm is observed. Studied compounds are devoid of anticancer activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines as well as in noncancerous human microvascular endothelial cells. The demonstrated lack of toxicity in combination with excimer emission allows for the assessment of dinucleoside distribution inside cancer Michigan cancer foundation (MCF)&#8208;7 cells with confocal luminescence microscopy. Compounds exhibit affinity to membranous structures as well as accumulate in the perinuclear region of the cells. Moreover, a selected dinucleoside is successfully conjugated to the deoxyribonucleotide 5&#8242;&#8208;d(TTT CTT TCC CTC)&#8208;3&#8242;. The resulting conjugate remains capable of forming a stable B&#8208;type DNA duplex with a complementary oligonucleotide strand.

         <title>Identifying the True Catalyst: A Mn(II) Salt versus Mn(II) Complexes in Epoxidation with m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the investigation of the reactivity of three Mn complexes, Mn(ClO4)2 shows higher reactivity toward styrene epoxidation, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese center. Raman spectroscopy provides mechanistic insight: monitoring alkene epoxidation and consumption of the oxidant over time, the true nature of the active catalyst is revealed, and competition reactions are discovered.

The oxidant meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) is used widely for the epoxidation of alkenes, yet its efficiency is often limited under ambient conditions. This study investigates the catalytic activity of a Mn(II) salt and mononuclear Mn(II) complexes, two of which are reported here for the first time, in the epoxidation of alkenes with m&#8208;CPBA under ambient conditions. Time&#8208;resolved Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor substrate conversion, oxidant consumption, and product formation. The data reveal that simple Mn(II) salts exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity than Mn(II) complexes, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese center. The catalytic efficiency of Mn(II) perchlorate is particularly notable, achieving near&#8208;complete oxidation of styrene within minutes under mild conditions. Furthermore, epoxidation of a range of alkenes demonstrates that Mn(II) salts provide broad substrate scope and high selectivity. These findings suggest that simple Mn(II) salts can serve as highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts in alkene epoxidations with m&#8208;CPBA.

         <title>Fluorinated Aminophosphonates and Aminophosphonic Acids: A Journey through Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the synthesis of fluorinated aminophosphonates and aminophosphonic acids are highlighted, with particular emphasis on regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective methods that allow precise introduction of fluorine atoms.

This review aims to summarize the most recent developments in the chemistry of fluorinated aminophosphonates and aminophosphonic acids, with a particular focus on literature published since the turn of 2016/2017. Fluorinated derivatives of aminophosphonates and aminophosphonic acids represent a rapidly growing area of interest due to their unique chemical properties and potential applications in various fields, including medicinal and agricultural chemistry. In this work, special emphasis is placed on highlighting the most significant reports concerning selective and efficient synthetic methodologies for these compounds. Particular attention is given to strategies that offer high yields, regio&#8208; or stereoselectivity, and operational simplicity, including direct fluorination, addition reactions, as well as catalytic and radical processes. Additionally, the review discusses the potential practical applications of these fluorinated derivatives, such as their roles as enzyme inhibitors, bioisosteres of amino acids, and potential pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Upcycling Food Waste: Ursolic Acid as Sustainable Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable strategy to access 24 ursane&#8208;type natural products from ursolic acid, derived from apple pomace waste. The method enables short syntheses (1&#8211;12 steps) with high yields (up to 98%). By upcycling food waste into valuable bioactive compounds, this work exemplifies green chemistry and supports circular economy principles in natural product synthesis.

Herein, a sustainable strategy to access the ursane class of natural products is presented. The complexity&#8208;controlling synthesis approach employs ursolic acid&#8212;readily obtained from apple pomace, a waste product of apple juice production&#8212;as sustainable feedstock to access 24 natural products of the ursane family in short synthetic sequences (1&#8211;12 steps) and good yields (up to 98%).

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans by [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] Annulation with Substituted Salicyl N&#8208;Phosphonyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis involving the [4 + 1] annulation of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with a sulfur ylide occurred with tunable diastereoselectivity depending on the cosolvent ratio of THF/EtOH. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission , aggregation&#8208;induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering experiments indicate that the stereocontrol observed in the reaction is due to the formation of chiral aggregates.

The aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis (AIAS) of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran compounds is achieved via the reaction of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with sulfur ylide. This transformation proceeds through a [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] annulation pathway, affording products in good to excellent yields with tunable diastereoselectivities. By employing various THF/EtOH cosolvent systems in conjunction with GAP chemistry, the conventional aggregation cosolvent systems are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing diastereoselectivity and modulating aggregate formation. This is supported by studies involving aggregation&#8208;induced emission, aggregation&#8208;induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering. The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of AIAS as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.

         <title>C4&#8208;Regioselective Dearomatization of Quinolinium Salts via Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intermolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction employing N&#8208;benzylquinolinium salts as electrophiles was developed. The reaction proceeds through a C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of the quinolinium substrate, contrary to the C2&#8208;regioselectivity that was observed in our previous report on a similar process. The switch in the regioselectivity was accomplished through the change of the counterion in the quinolinium salt to PF6&#8211; and the alteration of the reaction conditions, such as the application of a different catalyst (DABCO). The reaction allows for the preparation of functional group&#8208;rich products featuring the important 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline scaffold, complementing the earlier method which provides the corresponding 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline counterparts. The developed reaction is compatible with a range of substrates that also encompasses acridinium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular iodine&#8208;mediated functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Sulfoxonium ylides with Thiocyanates, Xanthates and Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present a straightforward, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective protocol for synthesizing three distinct classes of &#945;&#8208;functionalized sulfoxonium ylides&#8212;&#945;&#8208;xanthate, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate, and &#945;&#8208;dithiocarbamate&#8212;via molecular iodine&#8208;mediated reactions. This method demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, including heterocycles and steroids, delivering 25 examples with yields of up to 83%. Experimental studies revealed that iodine reacts with xanthates to form disulfides, which subsequently act as electrophiles for nucleophilic attack by the ylide.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion recognition induced selective separation of phosphates from complex aqueous matrices by self&#8208;assembled molecular capsule</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective recognition of an oxoanion necessitates the design and synthesis of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) receptors capable of discriminating between anions of comparable size, shape, and basicity. A urea&#8208;functionalized second&#8208;generation tripodal anion receptor has been demonstrated to selectively encapsulate and separate phosphate ions (PO43&#8211;, and HPO42&#8211;) from aqueous matrices of high anionic and cationic complexity. Competitive liquid&#8208;liquid extraction (LLE) experiments revealed exclusive formation of phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing oxoanions and halide, which is a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from highly eutrophic aquatic systems and also important for therapeutic applications as an effective phosphate binder. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide has served as a receptor solubilizer and an anion&#8208;exchange agent, facilitating phosphate transfer from the aqueous to the organic phase (dichloromethane) in exchange for hydroxide ions. The identity and purity of the LLE derived anion complexes were confirmed by NMR (1H, 13C and 31P) and mass spectroscopy (HR&#8208;MS), establishing phosphate selectivity of the receptor. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed phosphate encapsulation within a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimeric capsular assembly of the receptor (2:1 host&#8208;guest complex).</dc:description>

         <title>[3]Radialene fluorophores with pH&#8208;switchable emission and stable absorption maxima</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first push&#8208;pull quino [3]radialene fluorescent dye. Here, the novel bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene electron acceptor was connected to a benzimidazole donor. With protonation a substantial red&#8208;shift of fluorescence wavelength is observed, while the absorption maximum remains stable. This process is accompanied with an increased fluorescence quantum yield to about 70%. Further, we explain the findings by a combined experimental and theoretical approach and find that vibronic coupling plays a crucial role. This study highlights the yet unexplored potential of [3]radialene&#8208;based motifs for the design of environment&#8208;responsive fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones by Tandem Azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,4&#8208;Disubstituted morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety were unexpected products of a tandem combination of azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi reactions. The formation of the classical products &#8211; Ugi bisamides &#8211; was not observed at all in many cases. When the simplest C1&#8208;C3 aliphatic aldehydes were used and the reaction conditions were controlled, their isolation was possible. However, when butanal and pentanal as well as para&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes were used, only products of post&#8208;Ugi transformations, morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones, could be isolated. The latter could be synthesized either sequentially from the corresponding Ugi bisamides by post&#8208;Ugi transformation or in a one&#8208;pot procedure with prolonged stirring of the reaction mixture of four components &#8211; &#945;&#8208;aminomethyltetrazole, aldehyde, monochloroacetic acid and isocyanide. A small targeted library of 15 morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety was obtained by a novel approach. Furthermore, these compounds were able to eliminate the N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group from the tetrazole nitrogen in the presence of acid to form the corresponding NH&#8208;unsubstituted tetrazole derivatives of morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#946;&#8208;Siloxy Diamines and Application as Organocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines were developed as a tunable scaffold for structurally diverse diamine&#8208;based organocatalysts. Synthesis was initiated with the reaction of an oxazolidine methyl ester from L&#8208;serine with various Grignard reagents, introducing a wide range of diaryl substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position. By adjusting the reaction sequence of the silylation and amination steps, the developed synthetic approach enabled the incorporation of diverse aryl, silyl, and amine groups, including cyclic, acyclic tertiary, and secondary amines, into 1,2&#8208;diamines. The resulting diamines were evaluated as catalysts in the enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water using NFSI. Although the yield was similar to that of the conventional catalyst C1, the enantioselectivity was improved, reaching up to 53% ee.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Even though the amino&#8208;organo catalysis has been known for decades, the use of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric multi&#8211;amino catalysts in asymmetric synthesis is not widespread. Herein, we extended the approach previously employed for the chiral 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;cyclohexane to the enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diphenylethylendiammine. The independent activity of each catalytic subunit was also confirmed for this enantiopure motif by offline high&#8208;resolution ESI&#8208;MS experiments. We evaluated the advantages and limitations of this novel approach in the asymmetric Michael addition of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 4&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, achieving up to 95% yield and moderate to good stereocontrol (enantiomeric ratio up to 80:20). In the pool of synthetized molecules, there are two novel compounds, and one was prepared for the first time using organocatalysis. In addition, some of these molecules showed an intrinsic scavenging ability on ABTS&#8226;+ radical.</dc:description>

Green Approach for Copper&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Using Saponin&#8208;Based Micellar Catalysis in Water at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and sustainable protocol for Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to synthesize internal alkynes using a micellar catalysis system, which is derived from saponin, an inexpensive, biodegradable natural surfactant, at room temperature in aqueous medium has been developed.

A micellar catalysis that is derived from commercially available saponin for copper&#8208;free, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Using this green and sustainable method, a broad range of aryl/heteroaryl and alkyl terminal alkynes are cross&#8208;coupled with aryl/heteroaryl halides at ambient temperature in an aqueous medium. The commercially available, inexpensive, and plant&#8208;based natural saponin serves as a surfactant for a micellar system that effectively enables C(sp2)&#63743;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of substrates. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of water as a reaction medium, the in situ generation of the micellar&#8211;catalysis system from biodegradable natural saponins, good functional group tolerance, scalability of the products, and notably, the ability to retain the catalyst activity by recycling the aqueous reaction medium.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an intramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation process for the synthesis of the title scaffold from phenacyl enamide substrates. This method achieves high yields while eliminating the requirement for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates, as compared to Heck&#8208;type cyclization methodologies. Substrate scope and mechanistic studies indicate that the presence of electron&#8208;donating substituents in the incipient ring D moiety is essential for the cyclization, consistent with a pathway involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of iridium in ring D.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclization Reactions with &#947;&#8208;Hydroxyenones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article provides an overview of the recent developments in organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization strategies utilizing &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones. Due to the bifunctional nature of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones, it is a powerful building block for synthesizing oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The cyclization strategies are systematically categorized based on the nature of the organocatalysts employed: (i) chiral prolinol analogues, which obtain tetrahydrofuran&#8208;fused 3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins and 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydrofurans; (ii) chiral bifunctional squaramides, affording diverse spirocyclic frameworks such as spiro&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;pyrazolones, morpholinones, and oxindole&#8208;derived systems; (iii) chiral bifunctional thioureas, which forms 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes, oxazolidines, and cyclic acetals; (iv) multifunctional modular organocatalysts, affording enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones and (v) other chiral organocatalysts which cannot be grouped in previous categories such as Song&#8217;s chiral oligoethylene glycol as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst leads to the generation of chiral 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazinanes.</dc:description>

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Biogenic CuO Nanoparticles from Agro&#8208;Waste for One&#8208;Pot C&#8211;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a simple, green, and cost&#8208;effective method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) using waste cotton shell (WCS) ash extract, which serves as a natural base (pH 12), replacing conventional inorganic bases. The green&#8208;synthesized CuONPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity in heterogenous catalysis facilitating C&#8211;N bond formation, a key strategy for accessing various bioactive nitrogen heterocycles. TEM analysis reveals spherical morphology of the CuO nanostructure with an average particle size of 15.5 nm. The catalyst efficiently promotes the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives via cyclization of terminal alkynes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, offering broad substrate scope (17 quinoxaline derivatives), good yields, and recyclability. This methodology is also applicable to aliphatic terminal alkynes. Additionally, CuONPs also catalyzed the aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions of amines with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds at room temperature, affording excellent yields. The protocol tolerates a wide range of amines, including acyclic, cyclic (up to seven&#8208;membered rings), primary, secondary, and heterocyclic amines. Synthesis of 14 aza Michael addition products are reported. Furthermore, the CuO nanostructures exhibits high stability and reusability for up to five cycles with minimal loss of activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric reduction of &#946;-ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b-hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;-alkyl, &#946;-hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne-containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b-ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;-ketoesters with an alkyne function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing a Novel Organophotocatalyst for C&#63743;H Functionalization and E&#8211;Z Isomerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pyridazine&#8208;based organophotocatalyst that enables light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols and E&#8211;Z isomerization of 1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. This sustainable methodology offers efficient transformations under mild conditions, showcasing a green alternative to traditional protocols.

Organic chemistry continues to evolve by discovering and applying novel catalytic systems that enable efficient and selective transformations. Herein, the development and utilization of a newly synthesized organophotocatalyst for C&#63743;H functionalization and isomerization reactions are reported. A pyridazine derivative is successfully used here as a photocatalyst to synthesize 1,3&#8208;oxazines via C&#63743;H functionalizations of Betti bases (&#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols) and for the E&#8211;Z isomerization of 2&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. A tentative mechanism is also proposed for the catalytic behavior of the novel photocatalyst.

         <title>Catalytic Behavior of Cobalt Complexes Bearing Imine&#8211;Pyridine&#8211;Oxazoline Ligands in Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNN&#8208;pincer cobalt complexes are used to catalyze isoprene polymerization. Upon activation with AlEt2Cl, these cobalt complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and thermal stability in isoprene polymerization and provide cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8208;polyisoprene (cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2:1).

A series of cobalt complexes bearing imine&#8211;pyridine&#8211;oxazoline ligands are successfully synthesized and characterized. Upon activation with diethylaluminum chloride (AlEt2Cl), these cobalt complexes exhibit high catalytic activity in isoprene polymerization and provide cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;co&#8208;3,4 polyisoprene (cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2:1). Among them, a complex featuring a diphenylmethyl substituent demonstrates the highest thermal stability, maintaining a catalytic activity of up to 1.06&#8201;&#215;&#8201;105&#8201;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that this complex adopts a trigonal bipyramidal configuration via N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination to the cobalt center. Both the ligand architecture and the polymerization temperature are found to play critical roles in determining the catalytic performance and the structural properties of the resulting polymers. Furthermore, the influence of various polymerization parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity are systematically investigated.

         <title>On the Preparation of Nickel Porphyrins Bearing Two to Four Nitro Groups at &#946;&#8208;Positions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and unambiguous identification via NMR spectroscopy of all six &#946;$\beta$,&#946;&#8208;dinitrometalloporphyrin isomers and three out of four&#946;$\beta$,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trinitrometalloporphyrin isomers are described, along with attempts to prepare &#946;,&#946;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetranitrometalloporphyrins via both direct nitration and condensation of nitropyrroles.

The preparation, isolation, and identification of dinitro, trinitro, and tetranitro metalloporphyrins bearing nitro groups on pyrrole rings&#8212;desirable intermediates that enable fundamental changes in the chemico&#8208;physical properties of the porphyrin core&#8212;are studied. All six possible dinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers are formed; three are isolated as pure substances using column chromatography, while the remaining three are inseparable. All possible trinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers are prepared and isolated, except for the 2,7,13 isomer. Attempts to synthesize tetranitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP either through direct nitration of metalloporphyrin or via direct condensation of the nitropyrrole building blocks are unsuccessful. The molecular structures are unambiguously identified using 2D NMR experiments. Some experimental observations, though not all, are consistent with quantum chemical calculations performed on the geometry, energy, Fukui indices, dipole moments of nitroporphyrins, and the energy of nitration intermediates.

         <title>Assembly of 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Compounds by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;H Bond Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles are synthesized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. Convenient domino and one&#8208;pot sequential methods are also developed.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method is versatile, high yielding, and even suitable for domino and one&#8208;pot sequential protocols, combining the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]azepines and 4,6-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazoles are synthesized by palladium-catalyzed C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond activation.

&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole-fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]azepines and 4,6-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method is versatile, high yielding, and even suitable for domino and one-pot sequential protocols, combining the copper-catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium-catalyzed C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond activation.

         <title>The Novel Radical&#8208;Based Strategies for the Construction of &#945;&#8208;Allenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Allenols play a vital role in organic synthesis as they can undergo a wide range of transformations for the construction of natural products and pharmaceuticals. As compared to the two&#8208;electron transfer ionic pathway, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols by single&#8208;electron transfer under mild conditions with high efficiency and excellent selectivity.

&#945;&#8208;Allenols have become common advanced synthons for the synthesis of various of structures and are a frequent motif in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The special reactivity can occur due to the synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxy functional groups. Thus, many remarkable and elegant protocols have been explored through ionic pathways for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols. Recently, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols through single&#8208;electron transfer. As compared to the ionic pathway, the radical pathway has clear advantages, such as mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent selectivity control. In this review, the most important contributions for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols are summarized via radical intermediates by categorizing them into different types of substrates. Additionally, mechanistic studies and synthetic challenges are highlighted.

The work describes the copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed convenient synthesis of 5,5&#8242; bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by reacting glycosyl azides with terminal alkynes using di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as oxidant in refluxing toluene. The reaction proceeds through intramolecular &#8216;click&#8217; followed by Csp2&#63743; Csp2 bond formation in the successive steps under one&#8208;pot conditions. The method is further explored to access tetrakis(1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl) sialoconjugates.

The developed glycoconjugates have been characterized using extensive spectroscopic analysis, including NMR (1H &amp; 13C), IR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, and also a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray of compound 5e. Notably, the reaction proceeds in a one&#8208;pot fashion with a high atom economy, where a wide substrate scope with diversity in products finally validates the importance of the devised protocol.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Carboxylation of Aryl Boronates in Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal&#8208;free carboxylation of aryl boronates catalyzed by ZnO is achieved by using supercritical CO2. Cage&#8208;shaped cyclic trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in supercritical CO2, undergo the carboxylation efficiently in supercritical CO2 at high pressure and temperature to give corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids with good functional group tolerance.

Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source is an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein a transition metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO, is reported. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. density functional theory calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.

Bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene&#8208;modified naphtho[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) derivatives exhibit NIR emission, ambipolar charge transport properties, and good performance as fluorophores for nondoped NIR OLEDs (Von of 3.2&#8201;V, EQEmax of 2.51%, radiance of up to 23300&#8201;mW&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2).

Herein, this study reports the synthesis and characterization of efficient ambipolar charge&#8208;carrier transporting deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, namely MNTFT, PNTFT, and BMNTFT, based on an unsymmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8217; (D&#8211;A&#8211;D') structure, as well as their application as nondoped emitters in NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong acceptor, bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as the donor, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as donor'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge transfer excited states, which enable pathways for harvesting triplet hot excitons through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing with intense NIR emissions (&#8776;708&#8201;nm). Their unsymmetrical D&#8211;A&#8211;D&#8217; features benefit well&#8208;balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in their successful application as a nondoped emissive layer in OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the MNTFT&#8208;based nondoped device shows an NIR emission with an acceptor peak at 710&#8201;nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.51%, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8201;V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, this study reports the synthesis and characterization of efficient ambipolar charge-carrier transporting deep-red to near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores, namely &lt;b&gt;MNTFT&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PNTFT&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BMNTFT&lt;/b&gt;, based on an unsymmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8217; (D&#8211;A&#8211;D') structure, as well as their application as nondoped emitters in NIR organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong acceptor, bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as the donor, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as donor'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge transfer excited states, which enable pathways for harvesting triplet hot excitons through high-lying reverse intersystem crossing with intense NIR emissions (&#8776;708&#8201;nm). Their unsymmetrical D&#8211;A&#8211;D&#8217; features benefit well-balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in their successful application as a nondoped emissive layer in OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the &lt;b&gt;MNTFT&lt;/b&gt;-based nondoped device shows an NIR emission with an acceptor peak at 710&#8201;nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.51%, and a low turn-on voltage of 3.2&#8201;V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Amination of Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoids</title>

         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H amination of betulin 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester enables access to oxathiazinane&#8208;fused triterpenoids with high C16&#8208;selectivity. Sequential transformations yield 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido derivatives, offering versatile building blocks for medicinal chemistry. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent directs further C&#63743;H amination to C22.

A synthetic protocol for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H amination of the betulin scaffold has been developed. Under catalytic conditions, betulin&#8208;derived 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester undergoes intramolecular C&#63743;H amination to afford 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazinane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dione&#8208;fused lupane triterpenoids with a C16/C22 selectivity ratio 9:1. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent enables a second sequential C&#63743;H amination, which occurs with C22 selectivity. Betulin&#8208;derived oxathiazinanes can be cleaved and the ring&#8208;opened products provide straightforward access to 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido&#8208;betulin, 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulinic, and 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulonic acids. Betulin analogs with selectively introduced amine and azide functionalities are versatile building blocks for further medicinal chemistry applications in semisynthetic triterpenoid series.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been successfully developed under ambient conditions by merging Rh(III) catalysis with photoredox catalysis.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been achieved at ambient conditions by merging Rh(III)&#8208;catalysis with photoredox catalysis. Various spirocyclized quinazolinone derivatives are synthesized with a broad substrate scope in up to 92% yields at room temperature. A further mechanistic study involving control experiments, UV spectroscopy, light on&#8208;off experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, H/D labeling study, and hydrogen peroxide detection tests has been explored. The present methodology is demonstrated to be effective for scale&#8208;up synthesis, enabling the efficient generation of the spirocyclic product.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Topological Variations on the Stability of the Ground Singlet and Lowest&#8208;Lying Triplet States of Catacondensed Hexabenzenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) like tetracenes, pentacenes, hexacenes, and some higher acenes play a central role in organic electronics due to their unique electronic properties. The impact of topological variations on the relative stability of PAH isomers in different electronic states is poorly understood, with limited insights into how Clar p&#8208;sextets and topological features like bay, cove, fjord, and K&#8208;regions influence stability in their ground singlet (S0) and lowest&#8208;lying triplet (T1) states. In this work, we perform density functional theory calculations of the S0 and T1 states of the 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids. We use a multivariate linear regression model with relative energy as the dependent variable and a series of topological parameters as the independent variables to quantify the effect of topology in the relative stability of the catacondensed hexabenzenoids. Our analysis shows that, in S0, stability is enhanced by an increase in the number of Clar p&#8208;sextets and K&#8208;regions and decreased by the presence of coves and fjords. In T1, the main stabilizing factors are the number of Clar p&#8208;sextets and the number of rings involved in the antiaromatic region, whereas topological regions like K&#8208;edges, bays, coves, or fjords are destabilizing.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Convertible Groups to Expand the Substrate Scope for Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrenes by Photocatalytic Activation of Sulfur Hexafluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox properties of the substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates are converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents allows a significant expansion of the substrate scope.

The photocatalytic activation of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an important synthetic method to access pentafluorosulfanylated organic compounds because of the nontoxic properties of this gas. However, the redox properties of the organic substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates has to be converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of &#945;&#8208;phenyl and &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes by using SF6.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance towards toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarises recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe to Impart Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission to Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology. However, there are a few fluorescence probes that covalently bind to less polar compounds without a catalyst. Herein, the design, synthesis, and click reaction of pyrene&#8208;based nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) are reported. The optical properties of the adducts of Pyrene&#8208;NO indicate that Pyrene&#8208;NO imparts the aggregation&#8208;induced emission behaviors to alkene&#8208;containing compounds.

Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds. While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds. In this article, pyrene&#8208;containing nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst. Pyrene&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye. The cycloadducts show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent. While the adducts to 1&#8208;hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil, as a natural glycerolipid, shows AIE in MeOH. The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77&#8201;K compared with that at room temperature. It is suggested that the aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Linked Anthracene Oligomers without Introducing Extra Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photochemical method to synthesize 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers, addressing solubility challenges and achieving efficient &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Using photochemical precursors, selective photoirradiation converts them into oligomers, highlighting the versatility of this method. This approach allows for the synthesis of thin films, offering new applications in organic electronics.

Photoconvertible precursors of 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers (trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) are synthesized through repeated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon exposure of these precursors to light at 450&#8201;nm, which corresponds to the n&#8211;&#960;* transition of diketone moieties, yellow precipitates are formed, suggesting the conversion to the corresponding anthracene oligomers from the precursors. The disappearance of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance peaks after photoirradiation indicates the formation of anthracene oligomers with less solubility. High&#8208;resolution (HR) mass spectrometry evidently indicates the oligomer formations, and infrared (IR) spectral analysis for thin films show the disappearance of peaks originating from the carbonyl groups, also supporting the conversion. The absorption spectra after photoirradiation indicate a red shift in the absorption peaks accompanying oligomer formations, suggesting an extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The low solubility of the resulting anthracene oligomers in organic solvents highlights the effectiveness of this synthetic strategy using the photoconvertible precursor. This study provides a practical method to synthesize acene oligomers without the introduction of extra substituents.

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide &#8208; responsive aminoferrocene prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;&#8208; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non&#8208;targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;. This modification enhanced the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&#8325;&#8320; from 23.9&#8211;35.5 &#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4 &#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirmed that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation&#160;of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14 years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Films: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a class of crystalline porous materials, have attracted substantial interest due to their tunable structures and diverse functionalities. This review examines recent advancements in the preparation of COF films, with a particular focus on the strategies employed to synthesize these materials while achieving high crystallinity and porosity. The challenges encountered during the synthesis and application of COF films are discussed, including the necessity for scalable production methods and the optimization of their properties for practical applications. Current research and innovation efforts in the field of COF films are poised to broaden their potential applications across various domains. Although the synthesis of large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal COF films presents significant challenges, the progress observed in this area offers promising avenues for unlocking the full potential of COF films in electronic and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of Finerenone via Evans' Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports a new application of Evans' chiral auxiliary for an efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone. This new application successfully achieves the key step of stereoselective construction of the naphthyridine core of finerenone, with a high diastereomeric ratio (dr 86:14) and an 80% yield of the desired product via Evans&#8217; chiral (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The downstream transamidation of ethyl ester, with ammonia, leads to the formation of finerenone.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted environmentally benign synthesis of various 9&#8208;alkylbenzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives in the presence of 5 mol % disodium salt of eosin Y (EY) as photocatalyst is reported from 2&#8208;(7,8,9,10&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c]phe&#8208;nanthridin&#8208;6&#8208;yl) phenol derivatives, which were prepared through a three&#8208;component reaction. In the present protocol, EY photosensitized singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) promotes intramolecular cyclization through an oxidative hetero cross&#8208;coupling reaction, followed by aromatization to provide the final product in a single step, which has not been reported earlier. The mechanism of the reaction was established through DFT calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with BHT, which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer (EnT) process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Cyclic Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Core: from Syntheses to Properties and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, substances possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold showed interesting photo&#8208;physical properties and other potential applications in electronics. The afore&#8208;mentioned compounds belong to the family of five regioisomeric dihydroindenofluorenes, but unlike other ones, they possess angular or, in the case of higher congeners, helical shape. This review is mainly focused on various synthetic approaches to compounds possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold and their conversions to other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, their physico&#8208;chemical and photophysical properties, and current and/or potential applications are briefly described as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical arylation reactions mediated by a terpyridine cobalt complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex [CoII(4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy)2](PF6)2 (4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy = 4'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) effectively mediates visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles, 1,3,5&#8209;trimethoxybenzene and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2). Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction likely proceeds via a halogen atom transfer mechanism facilitated by an &#945;&#8209;aminyl radical. This work highlights the potential of optimizing the ligand framework and reaction conditions to advance the application of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes in photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Heterocycles for Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit significant potential for applications in electroluminescence, owing to their distinctive electronic structures and varied chemical properties. Phosphorus heterocycles serve multifunctional roles within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including as emitters, host matrices, and electron and hole blocking layers, contributing to enhanced device performance. Their intrinsic structural characteristics confer key advantages, including superior thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and suitable energy level alignment, all of which are essential for optimizing electroluminescent efficiency. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclics materials and discuss their structure property relationships, which would provide insights into expanding the applicability of OLEDs.</dc:description>
