         <title>A Mild Glycosylation Protocol with Glycosyl 1&#8208;Methylimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates as Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild glycosylation protocol is developed by using glycosyl 1&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates as donors. Such a glycosylation can be promoted by a series of metal triflates and triflimides, especially Cu(OTf)2.







Abstract
A mild glycosylation protocol is developed by using glycosyl 1&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. Such a glycosylation can be promoted by a series of metal triflates and triflimides, especially Cu(OTf)2. The reaction is initiated by activation of the glycosyl ester donor via coordination with the metal cation assisted by the adjacent 1&#8208;methylimidazole chelating group.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Domino Processes Involving the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a schematic presentation of different reaction pathways from a key bidentate B&#8208;N complex. The depicted products are a result of an inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction followed by either an elimination at high temperatures, a group&#8208;transfer reaction mediated by excess amine, or a photo&#8208;induced ring opening reaction. Within this mechanistic study, deeper insights into domino IEDDA reactions were gained. The background portrays the lake &#8216;Plansee&#8217; in Austria (copyright by Julia Ruhl), whose neighbored mountain pass reminds of a typical depiction of a potential energy surface (copyright of the illustration by Marcel A. Strauss). More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8197;A. Wegner et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from  &#969;&#8208;  amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2&#8208;azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance. Noticeably, no metallic based catalyst was required to perform such transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Model Studies on the Enzyme&#8208;Regulated Stereodivergent Cascade Passerini Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral &#945; &#8208;acyloxy carboxamides containing two stereogenic centers continues to be a challenging field of organic chemistry. Herein, we have proposed and proved the feasibility of an enzyme regulated&#8208;cascade reaction, which using the same substrates enables the formation of individual stereoisomers of &#945; &#8208;acyloxy carboxamides with up to 99% ee . The access to the individual stereoisomeric products has been achieved by the combination of the enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic vinyl esters, subsequent Passerini reaction, and enzymatic kinetic resolution of formed &#945; &#8208;acyloxy carboxamides. The presented studies are promising in exploratory proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enzyme&#8208;controlled stereoodivergent cascade to form an important class of chiral compounds for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure 2,9&#8208;Dideuterodecane &#8211; Preparation and Proof of Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 27, Page 3854-3863, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active (S,S)&#8208;(2,9&#8208;2H2)&#8208;n&#8208;decane was prepared in five steps from (R)&#8208;propylene oxide. Its optical purity was determined at the stage of (S)&#8208;(5&#8208;2H2)&#8208;1&#8208;hexene, being an intermediate of the synthetic approach, by NMR spectroscopy after Wacker oxidation and enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. (R,R)&#8208;(2,9&#8208;2H2)&#8208;n&#8208;decane was prepared analogously.







Abstract
(R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;(2,9&#8208;2H2)&#8208;n&#8208;Decane were prepared regio&#8208; and stereospecifically in 25&#8211;26&#8201;% yield over five steps from commercially available enantiopure (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;propylene oxide, respectively. The synthetic procedure involved nucleophilic displacement of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;4&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pentenyl ester with LiAlD4 to furnish the respective (5&#8208;2H)&#8208;1&#8208;hexenes. Subsequent olefin metathesis and reduction of the double bond furnished the title compounds. The optical purity of (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;(2,9&#8208;2H2)&#8208;n&#8208;decane could not be determined by chromatography or polarimetry. Therefore, (R,R)&#8208; and (R,S)&#8208;(5&#8208;2H)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;hexanone were prepared from their respective hexenes by Wacker oxidation, followed by enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. The enantiopurity could then be determined by NMR spectroscopy because the stereospecifically deuterated hydroxyketones showed separated signals for the subterminal carbon atom (C&#8208;5) in the 13C NMR spectrum.

The synthetic procedure involved nucleophilic displacement of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-4-toluenesulfonic acid 1-methyl-4-pentenyl ester with LiAlD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to furnish the respective (5-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H)-1-hexenes. Subsequent olefin metathesis and reduction of the double bond furnished the title compounds.

Therefore, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-(5-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone were prepared from their respective hexenes by Wacker oxidation, followed by enantioselective &#945;-hydroxylation. The enantiopurity could then be determined by NMR spectroscopy because the stereospecifically deuterated hydroxyketones showed separated signals for the subterminal carbon atom (C-5) in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

Diastereoselective addition to a single sulfinimine allows for stereodivergeant synthetic approaches towards two related natural products monomorine and indolizidine 195B via closed or open transition states.







Abstract
A simple and efficient stereoselective total syntheses of two natural products (+)&#8208;monomorine I and (+)&#8208;indolizidine 195B in high yields starting from a readily available alcohol is described. The key step in this synthetic route exploits the judicious use of solvent to enable a closed or open transition state in a nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagent to sulfinimine, giving selective access to two distinct diastereomers required for the formation of the two target natural products.

         <title>Aryl fluoroalkyl sulfoxides: optical stability and pKa&#160;measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantiomeric separation of aryl trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl sulfoxides was realized&#160; via &#160;chiral chromatography. The configurational stability of each set of enantiomers was then studied by thermal enantiomerization. The&#160; &#916;G&#8225; &#160;values obtained cover a range of 38.2&#8208;41.0 kcal.mol &#8208;1 &#160;at 214 &#176;C, thus demonstrating their optical stability at room temperature. However, a shorter half&#8208;life time has been observed for difluoromethyl sulfoxides. Furthermore, the acidities of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined in DMSO by an overlapping indicator method using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations. The pKa &#160;values fall in range of 20.3&#8208;22.5 and differ by about 10 log units compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions of methylated adenine derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding between nucleobases is a crucial noncovalent interaction for the life on Earth. Apart from Watson&#8208;Crick binding, Hoogsteen pairing has been found in many structures of nucleic acids. Methylation of nucleic acids (NAs) is a post&#8208;replication or post&#8208;transcription mechanism that can modulate the structure and function of a NA without changing its sequence. Methylation of adenine at the  N  6  position to form m6A is one of the most important and common epigenetic markers. This paper describes an investigation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions of methylated derivatives of adenine with its complementary partner, thymine. Adenine derivatives with (di)methylamino groups in positions 2 or 6 have been prepared and their interactions with a thymine derivative have been studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. It has been found that Hoogsteen pairing is preferred for adenine derivatives, which offer two hydrogen&#8208;bond sites on both Watson&#8211;Crick and Hoogsteen sides of the molecule. Methylation of the  N  6  position leads to further stabilization of the Hoogsteen pair.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of complex spiro{pyrrolidine&#8208;3,1'&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole} skeleton employing mild conditions is presented. The order of addition of a primary amine, two equivalents of the corresponding maleimide and finally, the aldehyde is of a paramount importance to obtain these final compounds in very high yields. The mechanism is studied performing very simple tests, the Michael type addition of the amine onto the maleimide being the key step. Interestingly, the hybrid scaffold is prepared by sequential addition of two different maleimides. In addition, a more interesting architecture is prepared through a metathesis reaction between allylic residues bonded in the molecule precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solid&#8208;Phase Assisted Flow Approach to in situ Wittig&#8208;Type Olefination Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the development of a continuous flow, solid&#8208;phase triphenylphosphine (PS&#8208;PPh3) assisted protocol to facilitate the in situ coupling of reciprocal pairs of halogen and carbonyl functionalised molecular pairs via a Wittig olefination within 15 mins. The protocol entails injecting a single solution (1:9 CHCl3:MeOH) containing the halogenated and carbonyl&#8208;based substrates into a flowing stream of CHCl3:MeOH (9:1) which is passaged through a fixed bed of K2CO3 and PS&#8208;PPh3. With advancement to the previous PS&#8208;PPh3 coupling procedures, the method employs a traditional polystyrene&#8208;based immobilisation matrix, the substrate scope of the protocol extended to substituted ketones, secondary alkyl chlorides, and an unprotected maleimide scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids with Multi&#8208;Active Sites Synergistically Catalyzed Metal&#8208;Free Transformation of Alcohols Using Dimethyl Carbonate as an Environmental Solvent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 27, Page 3819-3826, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;based ionic liquids with multiple active sites synergistically catalyzed C3 substitution of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin with alcohols in dimethyl carbonate was demonstrated. The system was efficient, economic and environmental and successfully applied for the synthesis of coumatetralyl as commercial rodenticide. And a mechanism involving a SN1 pathway, synergistically promoted effect of hydrogen bonding, carbocation and ether was proposed.







Abstract
One of the ultimate goals in organic synthesis is to develop metal&#8208;free, efficient and easily separable catalytic system for atom economic organic reactions in an environmental solvent. Direct substitution reaction of alcohols and hydrocarbon compounds is a significant and atom economic method for C&#8722;C bond formation. Herein, a metal&#8208;free and efficient catalytic system including recyclable pyridine&#8208;based ionic liquids with multiple active sites as the catalyst and dimethyl carbonate as the environmentally friendly solvent was developed for atom economic C3 substitution of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins with alcohols. Primary aromatic alcohols, secondary aliphatic and aromatic alcohols were suitable for the reaction, providing up to 99&#8201;% yield. The catalytic system could be easily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale with nearly quantitative yield. Coumatetralyl as commercial rodenticide could be prepared directly from commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol. Racemic product derived from the reaction of (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin indicated the reaction was achieved through an SN1 pathway. The comparison of the activities and acidities of the ionic liquids demonstrated that there was no directly relationship between them. Control experiments showed that the reaction probably proceeded via carbocation, ether intermediate and synergistically promoted effect of hydrogen bonding between the ionic liquid with multi&#8208;active sites and substrates.

The iodine&#8208;catalyzed catalytic formal [3+3+1] annulation for the construction of a seven&#8208;membered O&#8208;heteocycle with quinoline is developed. This strategy involves a seven&#8208;membered dihydrooxepine with a broad substrate scope through a formal three&#8208;component tandem reaction. Further derivation of the target product produced a trioxabicycle scaffold, which formed the basic core of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules, a broad substrate scope shows a graceful synthetic method.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Highly Potent Fungicidal Deoxy&#8208;Hygrophorones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 27, Page 3827-3836, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although stripped from hydroxyl&#8208;groups, deoxygenated hygrophorones remain highly active against severe phytopathogens. The synthesis to these natural product congeners is achieved in rearrangement sequences, with an optimized deprotection strategy avoiding retro&#8208;aldol reactions. The activities are comparable to fungicides used in agriculture.







Abstract
Based on naturally occurring hygrophorones, racemic di&#8208; and mono&#8208;hydroxylated cyclopentenones bearing an aliphatic side chain have been produced in short synthetic sequences starting from furfuryl aldehyde. For the series of dihydroxylated trans&#8208;configured derivatives, an Achmatowicz&#8208;rearrangement and a Caddick&#8208;ring contraction were employed, and for the series of trans&#8208;configured mono&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives a Piancatelli&#8208;rearrangement. All final products showed good to excellent fungicidal activities against the plant pathogens B. cinerea, S. tritici and P. infestans.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of a Series of Thioglycosides: Analogs of Arbutin with Efficient Antipigmentation Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 27, Page 3812-3818, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalyzed synthesis led to the preparation of a series of thioglycoside analogs of arbutin. These original molecules demonstrated potent tyrosinase inhibition properties as well as the capacity to interact with lectins at the surfaces of cells. The presence of the sulfur atom proves therefore to increase the biological potency of these glycosides.







Abstract
Arbutin, a natural glycoside, is well known as a commercial tyrosinase inhibitor, and thus, to prevent pigmentary disorders of skin. In fact, tyrosinase is involved in the biosynthesis of melanin, the skin main pigment. However, arbutin is subject to hydrolysis, which limits its bioactivity. In general, thioglycosides are known to be very resistant to both chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, which increases the interaction time with their biological targets. A biocatalytic approach allowed us to access to thioglycosidic analogs of arbutin in a green approach with good to excellent yields. Such compounds have then been tested as tyrosinase inhibitors as well as inhibitors of melanin transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This latter mechanism takes place via lectin (or lectin&#8208;like) receptors present on the cells surface. p&#8208;Aminophenyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside appears to be an excellent candidate thanks to its tyrosinase inhibitory activity comparable to arbutin, while having the ability to interact with glycan receptors allowing to reduce melanin transfer.

         <title>Azaphilone pigments from Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H.&#160;texense: absolute configuration, bioactivity, and biosynthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new stromatal azaphilone pigments rubiginosins D&#8722;F from the ascomycete  Hypoxylon rubiginosum  , and rubiginosins D and G from  H.&#160;texense  , along with known monomeric and dimeric congeners. Structures were elucidated using comprehensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis, revealing azaphilones from both fungi to be exclusively C&#8209;8(  S  )&#8208;configured. The orsellinic acid (OA)&#8208;carrying rubiginosins A, D and dimeric rutilins A&#8722;B exhibited cytotoxicity, while rubiginosins F&#8722;G bearing linear polyketide side chains and rutilins A&#8722;B were antimicrobial. Structures of the differently&#8208;substituted azaphilones were linked to two putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs;  hraza1  /  2  ) in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  , which are proposed to collaboratively synthesize the OA&#8208;substituted azaphilones. These share high homology with the azaphilone&#8208;forming BGCs  hfaza1  /  2  from  H.&#160;fragiforme  . Comparison of  hraza  and  hfaza  suggests that lack of an FAD&#8208;dependent monooxygenase and acyltransferase gene in  hraza1  prevent formation of C&#8208;8(  R  )&#8208;configured fatty acid&#8208;substituted azaphilones in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  . The polyketide synthase&#8208;derived side chain of rubiginosins C and F&#8722;G is not encoded in the respective BGCs, showing that a third BGC is hypothetically involved in their formation. Cross&#8208;interaction of three BGCs forming a single molecule is unprecedented in fungal natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Anthranils&#160;by PhIO Mediated Heterocyclization of ortho&#8208;Carbonyl Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a metal&#8208;free synthesis of anthranils from  ortho  &#8208;carbonyl anilines using PhIO as a sole reagent under ambient conditions. This methodology did not require any external additives and delivered anthranils in excellent yields with broad substrate scope. The mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via  in&#8208;situ  generation of iminoiodane leading to nitrene and a subsequent nucleophilic attack from oxygen of  ortho  &#8208;carbonyl aniline on nitrene results in heterocyclization.</dc:description>

An approach for the preparation of polysustituted furans through a metal&#8208;free base&#8208;catalyzed oxacyclization of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols is described. With this approach 32 new compounds were obtained. Furthermore, natural population analysis by DFT calculations, highlighted experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran.







Abstract
An efficient base catalyzed oxacyclization of Z&#8208;enynols has been developed under transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, thus resulting in a variety of new di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. This approach allowed us to obtain 32 new compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were realized to depict a relationship between the natural population analysis and experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran. A one&#8208;pot Sonogashira/oxacyclization approach offers a flexible, robust and efficient alternative to base catalyzed cyclization is also carried out.

The Front Cover shows a 3D&#8208;chess board illustrating strategies developed to introduce several addends onto the fullerene core in a regioselective manner. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;tethered macrocyclic bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;malonates have been used to functionalize C60 in multiple Bingel cyclopropanations. The bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene unit is not only a directing group for the cyclization step, it is also a protecting group that can be readily cleaved to afford valuable acyclic fullerene building blocks. These have been used to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.

A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. Upon functionalization of the fullerene sphere, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic bis&#8208;malonates incorporating either di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene or tetra&#8208;iso&#8208;propyldisiloxane subunits have been prepared and used for the regioselective bis&#8208;functionalization of [60]fullerene by double Bingel cyclopropanations. By systematically changing the length and the rigidity of the spacer units linking the malonate moieties to the silylated protecting groups, fullerene bis&#8208;adducts with different addition patterns have been obtained. Finally, the bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene groups have been cleaved to afford the corresponding acyclic fullerene bis&#8208;adducts bearing four alcohol functions.

The Cover Feature shows the experimental and theoretical approach to the synthesis of polysubstituted furans, prevalent structural motifs in natural products, bioactive compounds or functional organic materials. A methodological study has shown that potassium tert&#8208;butoxide promotes the oxacyclization of Z&#8208;enynols leading to a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. At the same time, the analysis of natural populations by DFT calculations made it possible to rationalize the feasibility of this reaction. We would like to thank Mr Martin Gilardi for the creation of this drawing. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Thibonnet et&#8197;al.

Macrocyclic tris&#8208;malonate incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been used for the regioselective tris&#8208;functionalization of C60. Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. Further functionalization has been carried out to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.







Abstract
Macrocyclic tris&#8208;malonates incorporating cleavable di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been prepared by a stepwise approach and used for the regioselective tris&#8208;functionalization of C60. Fullerene tris&#8208;adducts with an e,e,e addition pattern have been thus obtained. The bridging di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene protecting groups have been cleaved to liberate the terminal alcohol functions of the fullerene tris&#8208;adduct. This key building block has been further functionalized to generate a clickable fullerene [3:3]&#8208;hexa&#8208;adduct scaffold allowing the successive introduction of two azide reagents.

         <title>Xanthates as thiol surrogates for nucleophilic substitution with aryl halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report an unprecedented xanthate&#8208;based protocol for the preparation of aryl&#8208;alkyl thioethers. Heating xanthates with aryl halides and namely cesium carbonate in methanol provides the target thioethers in generally good yields within short reaction times. This method allows one to avoid contact with odorous thiols and also to introduce substituents of which the corresponding thiols are virtually unavailable or inconvenient in use.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bispyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8208;Buchwald amination.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of the Natural Rubrolides B, I, K, L, M, O and Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chlorinated natural products, rubrolides B, I, K, L, M and O and analogues were synthesized in only five steps employing a robust and divergent synthetic strategy. The synthesis is performed without using protecting groups starting from a key intermediate, which can be synthesized from commercially available tetronic acid in only two steps. Selective halogenation and vinylogous aldol condensation enables the efficient synthesis of highly halogenated natural occurring rubrolides as well as synthetic analogues to build up a compound library for antiviral and antibiofilm testing. All synthesized compounds were then tested for their activity against the two influenza A virus strains  p  H1N1 and H3N2 as well as for their antibiofilm activity. Naturally occurring as well as synthetic analogues showed promising antiviral and antibiofilm activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols Using an Immobilized Oxovanadium Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous silica&#8208;supported oxovanadium catalyst enabled the direct substitution of benzyl and allyl alcohols with sulfur and carbon nucleophiles. The catalyst showed high chemoselectivity for alcohols in the presence of acid&#8208;labile functional groups and could be recycled more than seven times.







Abstract
Direct nucleophilic substitution of alcohols with thiols or carbon nucleophiles was achieved using a mesoporous silica&#8208;supported oxovanadium catalyst (VMPS4). Benzyl and allyl alcohols were compatible in this reaction under mild conditions, affording the products in high yields. The VMPS4 catalyst showed excellent chemoselectivity toward alcohols in the presence of acid&#8208;labile functional groups, which is in contrast to that observed for the commonly used Lewis acid catalysts, which exhibit poor selectivity. The VMPS4 catalyst could be recycled by simple centrifugation, and the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles.

         <title>One&#8208;step Conversion of Amides and Esters to Acid Chlorides with PCl3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient iodine&#8208;promoted chlorination of amides and esters with phosphorus trichloride is described. For the first time, various inactivated amides including secondary and tertiary amides were directly converted to the corresponding acid chlorides in one&#8208;step. The substrate scope of methyl esters including aromatic and aliphatic esters was also explored under this system. This method is simple, scalable and wide in scope, which provides an approach to preparation of these acid chlorides.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Aziridines Via Asymmetric Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclopentenone, a key synthon for the preparation of natural products and many nucleoside inhibitors, was obtained via a new ring&#8208;opening of a strained aziridine in high yields and in moderate (up to 74&#8201;% ee, 87&#8201;:&#8201;13&#8197;er) enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein we report the first organocatalytic method for the desymmetrization of meso&#8208;aziridines that does not require the use of an external nucleophilic reagent. The process was designed upon a base promoted rearrangement of bicyclic meso&#8208;cyclopentanone aziridines, that progresses in intramolecular fashion to provide densely functionalized cyclic ketones, key intermediates for the preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. The key enantio&#8208;determining step proceeded under the catalysis of a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst. The process provides an entry to a class of highly functionalized chiral amines, 4&#8208;aminocyclopentenones, not accessible with previous desymmetrization methods. The ambiphilic nature of the products makes them versatile synthetic intermediates in the preparation of natural products and popular antiviral nucleoside inhibitors, for example abacavir.

         <title>A simple strategy to obtain synthetic Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin mimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many lectins require a Ca  2+  ion as structure directing co&#8208;factor to function as carbohydrate binders. Such lectins are implicated in various important biological processes such as inflammation and infection, yet a simple strategy to mimic their function is lacking. Herein, a very simple dipyridyl ligand (  6  ) is reported that can organize around a Pd  2+  ion to form the ring&#8208;like complexes [PdCl  2  6  ] and [Pd  6  2  ]  2+  . In CD  2  Cl  2  with 5% dmso&#8208;  d  6  , ligand  6  does not associate with glycosides, while its Pd  2+  complexes selectively bind to &#946;&#8208;  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;glycosides over &#945;&#8208;  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;glycosides. The highest affinity (  K  a  1:1  &#8776; 116 M  &#8208;1  ) was found between the dicationic [Pd  6  2  ]  2+  and  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside. Molecular modelling suggests a common binding motif with an important role of C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and two charge assisted bifurcated [N&#8211;H/C&#8211;H]  +  &#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds. Ligand  6  and its metal complexes thus provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a very simple strategy to mimicking Ca  2+  &#8208;dependent lectins.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Electrochemical Oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Selenylation of Resveratrol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work describes an electrochemical oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H selenylation of resveratrol. Driven by galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell, it provided efficient transformation in an open system at room temperature. Using this benign, atom&#8208;economic protocol, the desired selenylated products were obtained regioselectively, in good to excellent yields by using half molar equiv. of the diselenides.







Abstract
A simple and environmentally benign procedure for electrochemical oxidative mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenylation of the resveratrol C(sp2)&#8722;H bond was developed. Driven by galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell, it provided efficient transformation under oxidant&#8208;, base&#8208;, and transition metal&#8208;free conditions, in an open system at room temperature. With satisfactory functional group compatibility, it required a substoichiometric amount of NaI, which acted as an electrolyte and mediator.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of BODIPY Appended Tetraphenylethylene Scaffolds as Photoactive Arrays</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives exhibit excellent aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. The TPE unit is easily accessible and many functional groups can be introduced in a facile manner to yield effective luminescent materials in both solution and the solid&#8208;state. It is because of this, several TPE&#8208;based compounds have been developed and applied in many areas, such as OLEDs and chemical sensors. Boron dipyrromethanes (BODIPYs) are a class of pyrrolic fluorophore of interest with myriad application in both material science and biomedicine. Through the combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions and traditional dipyrromethane chemistry, we present the syntheses of novel tetra&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;appended TPE derivatives with different &#8216;arm&#8217; lengths. The TPE&#8208;BODIPY arrays  6  and  9  show vastly differing AIE properties in THF/H  2  O systems, with  9  exhibiting dual&#8208;AIE, along with both conjugates being found to produce singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). We presume the synthesized BODIPY&#8208;appended TPE scaffolds to be utilized for potential applications in the fields of light harvesting systems and delivery of photosensitizers and for the construction of porous materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A V2O5@TiO2 catalyzed green and efficient protocol for the hydroxylation of boronic acid into phenol has been developed utilizing environmentally benign oxidant hydrogen peroxide. A wide range of electron&#8208;donating and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;containing (hetero)aryl boronic acids were transformed into their corresponding phenol. The methodology was also applied successfully to transform various natural and bioactive molecules like tocopherol, amino acids, cinchonidine, vasicinone, menthol, and pharmaceuticals such as ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol. The other feature of the methodology includes gram scale synthetic applicability, recyclability, and short reaction time.</dc:description>

         <title>Diaminoterephthalate&#8208;EDTA and &#8208;EGTA Conjugates &#8211; &#8220;Turn on&#8221; Fluorescence Sensors for Zinc Ions</title>

Zinc turns it on! Conjugation of the fluorescence dye diaminoterephthalate with EDTA results in a constitutionally very simple sensor (DAT)2EDTA with remarkable selectivity towards Zn2+ ions. In the presence of one equivalent of Zn(OAc)2 in solution, the fluorescence quantum yield is increased by factor of about six!







Abstract
A highly effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor with high selectivity for Zn2+ ions is reported. Its constitution simply consists of two units of the fluorescence dye diaminoterephthalate (DAT) and the chelate ligand EDTA. In total, four products (DAT)2EDTA and (DAT)2EGTA were prepared by conjugation of DATs with chelate ligands EDTA and EGTA as sensors for metal ions in solution. The fluorescence of all four compounds is strongly quenched by coordination of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions. For one EDTA&#8208;derivative, the fluorescence quantum yield is increased by the factor of five with ten equivalents of ScCl3. For both EDTA derivatives, the fluorescence quantum yield increased by the factor of five with one equivalent Zn(OAc)2. Therefore, the (DAT)2EDTA structures constitute fluorescence sensors with a high selectivity for Zn2+ accompanied by a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; effect with Zn2+ ions. Furthermore, the coordination geometry of (DAT)2EDTA with Zn2+ was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis of the trinuclear complex [ZnCl2]{Zn(OH2)[(DAT)2EDTA &#8211; 2 H]}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6.5 H2O.

         <title>Pd0&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling of [11C]Methyl Iodide with Carboxysilane for Synthesis of [11C]Acetic Acid and its Active Esters: 11C&#8208;Acetylation of Small, Medium, and Large Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
A synthetic method for the preparation of radioactive [11C]acetic acid and its active esters starting from [11C]CH3I is reported. The Pd&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling of [11C]CH3I with triphenylcarboxysilane gave [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid in a high yield. [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid was rapidly converted into [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid imidyl esters, which are useful for the radiolabeling via 11C&#8208;acetylation of organic molecules.







Abstract
A rapid Pd0&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling of [11C]CH3I with carboxytriphenylsilane (1) to synthesize [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid ([11C]2) and its corresponding imidyl esters as radiolabeling reagents for 11C&#8208;acetylation is reported. The reaction of [11C]CH3I with 1 using a Pd2(dibenzylideneacetone)3/P(o&#8208;tolyl)3 (1&#8201;:&#8201;4) catalyst in tetrahydrofuran/H2O (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) at 90&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;min afforded [11C]2 having satisfactory radioactivity and a good yield. The coupling of the cationic carbon atom of methyl iodide and the carboxyl group in 1 is an ionicity&#8208;driven reversed&#8208;polarity reaction. An injectable radiopharmaceutical formulation of [11C]2 prepared using 33&#8197;GBq of [11C]CH3I had a radioactivity of 7.4&#8211;7.8&#8197;GBq, and the decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of [11C]CH3I into [11C]2 was 63&#8211;73&#8201;%. [11C]2 was converted to [2&#8208;11C]acetic acid phthalimidyl ester ([11C]3) or its succinimidyl ester ([11C]10), which were used for the 11C&#8208;acetylation of 4&#8208;aminophenol, oxytocin, and albumin. Injectable solutions of these products (0.25&#8211;2.0&#8197;GBq) are suitable for in&#8197;vivo positron emission tomography studies.

The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion, in contrary to our previous results where  exo  &#8208;adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the  endo  &#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free&#8208;energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind  endo  &#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A scalable high&#8208;yielding and selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling &#8208; a key step for the synthesis of trans&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the&#160;  trans&#8208;  stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted&#160;  trans&#8208;  stilbenes, that revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#160;g (&gt;&#160;1000&#160; &#180; &#160;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90%. The inhibitorcandidate&#160;  DC10  &#160;[(  E  )&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities ( &#187; 33 g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies.

         <title>Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Bromocyanofluoro Pyridine&#160;Nuclei: Access to 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;Alkynylfluoropyridinamidoximes Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a general two&#8208;step procedure to access hitherto unknown and under explored 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinamidoximes from 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopyridines and a wide range of easily available and bench&#8208;stable terminal alkynes, using Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, as the first step.

         <title>Chemical and Biophysical Approaches to Allosteric Modulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since its discovery, allostery has emerged as a pivotal regulatory mechanism involved in many diverse biological processes. In this minireview, we present an overview of allostery models postulated through the years. In addition, we provide the description of useful computational and experimental approaches developed to study such a crucial process at the molecular level, followed by four representative case studies.







Abstract
Allosteric regulation, i.&#8201;e. the control exerted on an orthosteric site by an effector interacting at a distinct and distant site, represents a prime example of a precise tuning system of several key biological processes like gene transcription, cell adhesion and, most importantly, signal transduction. Since its discovery sixty years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been extensively investigated. The aim of this minireview is to introduce the reader to the topic of protein allostery. In particular, we briefly overview the allosteric models postulated over the years and we describe the most relevant chemical and biophysical approaches reported so far for the identification of putative allosteric sites and/or for the investigation of allosteric signal propagation throughout the protein. An outlook of the main computational and experimental methods is followed by four case studies representative of different proteins classes: enzymes, hub proteins, cell receptors, and intrinsically disordered proteins.

         <title>Recent Developments in Enantioselective Organocatalytic Cascade Reactions for the Construction of Halogenated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade reactions, either induced by halogenation or involving halogenated synthetic building blocks, have been utilized in recent years to obtain a variety of cyclic compounds, of interest for many applications. In this review the literature on enantioselective catalytic methods of synthesis is surveyed for the period 2014&#8211;2020.







Abstract
Chiral halogenated substances have many applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials, such as polymers, liquid crystals and as intermediates in synthesis. The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule can have a large effect in its properties; for instance, halogens are used in drugs to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability and absorption, and even the blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability. As highlighted in this review, there are nowadays a range of highly selective, versatile halogenating reagents, electrophilic, nucleophilic or radical in nature, which operate under mild conditions, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules in cascade reactions. Recent developments in organocatalyst design revealed novel Cinchona alkaloids derivatives, chiral phosphoric acids, amines, phosphines and several bifunctional catalysts, mostly thiourea&#8208; or squaramide&#8208;based, which introduced chirality, with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselection, in the formation of one or multiple chiral centers in a single synthetic operation, as shown. In this review we survey the literature published in this field from 2014 to 2020.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Domino Processes Involving the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8722;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been studied computationally as well as experimentally. Key intermediates and transition states have been identified, which allow to improve the reaction conditions as well as to develop new transformations in the future.







Abstract
The detailed understanding of mechanisms is the basis to design new reactions. Herein, we studied the domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) reaction developed in our laboratory computationally as well as by synthetic experiments, to characterize different pathways. A quinodimethane intermediate was identified as key structure, which is the basis for all subsequent transformations: Elimination to an aromatic naphthalene, rearrangement to a dihydroaminonaphthalene and a photo&#8208;induced ring opening. These insights allow to optimize the reaction conditions, such as catalytic utilization of amine, as well as to advance new reactions in the future.

         <title>Reactivity and Applications of Iodine Monochloride in Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for discovering new protocols to conduct reactions including halogenations, oxidations and cyclizations has recently led to a renaissance in studying reactions involving somewhat forgotten halogen&#8208;containing reactants. This Minireview documents the processes that have employed iodine monochloride, an intriguing, highly polarized compound composed of sole iodine and chlorine atoms.







Abstract
Over the last half&#8208;decade, routes towards accessing halogenated compounds of value such as bioactive pharmaceuticals, organic building blocks has been of interest to the synthetic community. The demand for new methodologies to access important compounds has surged over the period. Amongst the halogenating agents available in a chemist's toolbox, one reagent in particular, iodine monochloride (ICl), is relatively under employed in comparison to alternatives such as molecular iodine for example. In this Minireview, we document the most recent applications (2015&#8211;2020) of ICl in synthetic organic transformations, namely halogenations including iodinations and chlorination reactions, cyclizations, metathesis reactions as well as oxidation processes. Furthermore, its versatile nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.

&lt;p&gt;Over the last half-decade, routes towards accessing halogenated compounds of value such as bioactive pharmaceuticals, organic building blocks has been of interest to the synthetic community. The demand for new methodologies to access important compounds has surged over the period. Amongst the halogenating agents available in a chemist's toolbox, one reagent in particular, iodine monochloride (ICl), is relatively under employed in comparison to alternatives such as molecular iodine for example. In this Minireview, we document the most recent applications (2015&#8211;2020) of ICl in synthetic organic transformations, namely halogenations including iodinations and chlorination reactions, cyclizations, metathesis reactions as well as oxidation processes. Furthermore, its versatile nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <dc:description>
A tandem, one&#8208;pot, multicomponent reaction for direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides scaffolds with in&#8197;situ generated Michael acceptors are illustrated. The reaction proceeds under environmentally benign and straightforward conditions using visible light organo&#8208;photocatalysis and yields desired alkylated products with good yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Tandem, one&#8208;pot, multicomponent reaction for direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides scaffolds are illustrated. The basic nature of phosphoramide leads to a diverse set of in&#8197;situ generated Michael acceptors making the reactions highly atom and step economical. The reaction conditions are mild, entirely metal&#8208; and external additives free. Alkylated phosphoramides were obtained with good yields and selectivity using visible&#8208;light organo&#8208;photocatalysis.

Abstract

         <title>Luminescent Imidazolium Salts as Bright Multi&#8208;Faceted Tools for Biology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium salts bearing fluorophore units can be easily tuned to encompass the desired properties to explore the biological world and provide tools for medicine. Luminescence allows anion detection and cell imaging, while antibacterial and anticancer activities are also reported, as well as drug and gene delivery when the amphipathic character of the salt is delicately controlled.







Abstract
Light and cognate phenomena, e.&#8201;g., luminescence are powerful tools endowed with great sensitivity to explore the infinitely small. Molecular salts, especially those based on imidazolium units, are granted with original properties and structural versatility. Associated with fluorophores, they constitute highly bioavailable platforms. Their interactions with negatively charged species and biological membranes as well as their controllable cytotoxicity imparted their applications as anion receptors, but also a promising potential as antibacterial and anticancer agents whose mechanism of action can be observed using luminescence, opening the possibility of theranostics (therapy and diagnosis). One of the other assets of imidazolium salts is their flexible amphipathic character which promotes their self&#8208;organizations into liquid&#8208;crystal mesophases and their ability to mimic lipids. Combining luminescence to these amphipathic properties opens new prospects, e.&#8201;g., following gene or drug delivery inside cells. These salts, all&#8208;in&#8208;one, should lead to new tools for biologists, as well as active theranostic molecules.

Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

         <title>Electrochemical Induced Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Difunctionalization of Alkynes: The Synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Iodovinyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for electrochemical iodosulfonylation of alkynes was developed under oxidant&#8208;free condition. This procedure affords valuable &#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones with broad substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Moreover, this facile protocol can be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfone.







Abstract
An efficient, green, and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for alkyne difunctionalization was described. Using undivided electrochemical cell for iodosulfonylation of alkynes with commercially available iodide radical (NaI), arylsulfonyl radical (ArSO2NHNH2) sources, a variety of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones were obtained in one&#8208;pot with wide substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under mild and ecofriendly conditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphine Mediated Oxidative Phosphorylation of Aromatic Amines and P(OR)3 under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;phosphine system was developed to promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under aerobic conditions. Importantly, this method could be applied not only to the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates (C&#8722;P bonds) but also to produce phosphoramides (N&#8722;P bonds). This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;phosphine system (Cu(OAc)2 and t&#8208;Bu3P&#8901;HBF4) was used to synthesize &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates and phosphoramides from various aromatic amines and trialkyl phosphites under oxygen atmosphere. With this Cu&#8722;P system, &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates containing C&#8722;P bonds were generated from N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or N&#8208;methylanilines and trialkyl phosphites; phosphoramidates containing N&#8722;P bonds were produced from N&#8208;benzylanilines and trialkyl phosphites. This strategy provided a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of phosphorous compounds. The compounds containing phosphoryl group attracted extensive attention due to their biological activities and wide applications.[1,2] The &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates have been applied in medicine and agriculture such as anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antibacterial agents, and enzyme inhibitors.[1] And phosphoramides could be served as antibiotics, prodrugs, flame retardants, and ligands.[2]

         <title>Selective Nitration of Open&#8208;Cage [60]Fullerene Derivatives by Ponzio Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponzio reaction converts the oxime group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivatives into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, one of which acts as an effective stopper above the orifice.







Abstract
The carbonyl group on the rim of open&#8208;cage C60 derivative was converted into an oxime group when treated with hydroxylamine. Nitrogen tetroxide could convert the oxime group into gem&#8208;dinitro groups, similar to the Ponzio reaction of classical organic compounds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data shows that one of the nitro group is directly above the orifice acting as an effective stopper. Presence of the gem&#8208;dinitro groups also showed significant effect on the reactivity of other functional groups on the rim of the orifice.

A class of trinuclear N&#8208;fused hybrid scaffolds was constructed by transition metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling and cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208; or 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aryloxybenzimidazoles under microwave irradiation.

This process seems to proceed via an initial C(sp2)&#8208;N coupling by an addition&#8208;elimination nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and subsequent cyclization accompanied by extrusion of alcohols.

         <title>An Improved Stereocontrolled Access Route to Piperidine or Azepane &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters and Azabicyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Lactams; Synthesis of Novel Functionalized Azaheterocyles</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization through ozonolysis and cyclization with reductive amination of various readily available cycloalkenes.







Abstract
An improved, efficient synthesis of some functionalized saturated azaheterocycles has been accomplished by controlled functionalization of various readily available cyclic compounds containing ring C=C bond. The stereocontrolled synthetic concept was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of various unsaturated scaffolds across ozonolysis followed by ring closing with double reductive amination with primary alkylamines or fluorinated alkylamines. The protocol provided versatile azaheterocyclic derivatives with a piperidine or azepane framework.

Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free and Oxidant&#8208;Free Radical Cyclization of (2&#8208;Isocyanoaryl)(methyl)sulfanes with Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible light&#8208;induced oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanoaryl thioethers with ethers has been established, which provides an expeditious approach to access ether&#8208;functionalized benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields. The obtained products combine benzothiazole with ether and represent key structural motifs of a large of biologically active molecules in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A novel cascade cyclization of (2&#8208;isocyanoaryl) (methyl)sulfanes and ethers is developed. With 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and the irradiation of blue LED light, ether radicals are efficiently generated without adding any oxidant, endowing the strategy with features of oxidant&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity. This strategy provides efficient approach to access various ether&#8208;containing benzothiazoles in acceptable to good yields.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Catalyzed Cyclization of Bis(enones): A Viable Approach to the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclopentane Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor.







Abstract
Photoredox catalytic cyclization of aryl enones in the presence of visible light, promoted either by metals or organic dyes, represent a valuable strategy for the synthesis of cycloalkanes. The development of a stereoselective version of such transformation, in the presence of the metal&#8208;free catalyst Eosin Y was studied, with the aim to realize an efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings, taking advantage of the flow reactors technology. The use of a chiral auxiliary on the bisenone to be cyclized offers a straightforward and convenient option to exert a stereocontrol on the light&#8208;driven cyclization. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, a functionalized 1,2&#8208;trans cyclopentane ring in up to 83/17 enantiomeric ratio. When the reaction was performed in continuo, in a homemade coil photoreactor, high yields were observed. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor, without any change in the diastereoseletctivity of the process.

         <title>Haloacetylated enol ethers: a way out for the regioselective synthesis of biologically active heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review describes advances in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds (associated with their biological activity), using haloacetylated enol ethers as precursors. The wide variety of heterocycles that can be prepared using these precursors, together with the high regioselectivity they usually provide in type [3+2] and [3+3] cyclocondensation reactions, makes these powerful starting materials one may have in hand. The biological evaluation is also highlighted, given that several analogues of commercially available drugs can be easily accessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies Toward the Total Synthesis of Schinortriterpenoids: Diastereoselective Synthesis of the Left&#8208;Hand Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. The left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, has been synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. In this study, the left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, was synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity. This stereoselectivity was investigated by computational studies. Further selective transformation provided a tricyclic skeleton with the desired stereochemistry.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation on Modified Analogues of an Argininocalixarene Based Non&#8208;viral Gene Vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of eight novel calix[4]arene&#8208;cone amphiphiles bearing different types and numbers of cationic headgroups at the upper rim and different alkyl chains at the lower rim were synthesized and studied in pDNA binding and cell transfection in order to dissect the role of each of these structural elements on gene delivery properties of this promising class of non&#8208;viral vectors.







Abstract
The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene 1 has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different types of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by negligible toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, and v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg, might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into the cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carboborylation for the Synthesis of Borylated Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interception of &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;palladium complexes in catalysis is a powerful strategy for the generation of molecular complexity. We have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes, which proceeds in good yields and moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reaction were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and chiral deep eutectic solvents (CDESs) in asymmetric organocatalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this minireview we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Protosilylation/Protoborylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroallenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective protosilylation and protoborylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford tertiary and secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallyl compounds have been developed. The reactions proceed under very mild reaction conditions and provided the corresponding products in high efficiency.







Abstract
We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford gem&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. It is different from non&#8208;fluorine allenes in which nucleophiles are added to &#947;&#8208;position of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;addition products. Not only monosubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes but also disubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes could react well with silaboronate (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The protocol is simple and efficient to construct compounds which contain tertiary/secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. Moreover, diverse organofluorine compounds can be converted from these organoboronates and silanes.

         <title>Study of Rhodamine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Organic Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives were used as fluorescent probes in the detection and real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates in different solvents. Mechanism studies reveal a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring with the presence or absence of radicals.







Abstract
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives for the detection of radical intermediates in organic reactions were synthesized and used as fluorescent probes over a wide range of solvents. The mechanistic studies confirm a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring. Compound 21 can be used to support the radical mechanism or in the real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Methyl 2&#8208;Oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;based methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) has been oxidized to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Densely functionalized methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate is stable at low temperatures but slowly dimerizes by a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Accordingly, methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been developed as a new dienophile in the classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes







Abstract
Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by the addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <title>Strigolactones: Phytohormones with Promising Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes.

&lt;p&gt;The synthetic potential of 5-(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-vinyl sulfones and 9,10-substituted phenanthrenes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of 5-(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;-(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels-Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,7-dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
