         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational and Electron Density Analysis of Bicyclo[3.1.0] hexanes:&#160;All Roads Lead to Boats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of the existence of an optimal conformation for molecular recognition and bearing in mind that nucleosides exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical properties, whereby their conformation has a key role in molecular recognition, the tendency of the pseudosugar moiety in carbanucleosides to adopt a boat&#8208;like conformation has been studied on the basis of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane system, resulting in versatile druglike scaffolds to increase molecular recognition. It is already known that using this system as a pseudosugar can fix the conformation in the northern or southern geometry required for biological activity, according to the relative position of the three&#8208;membered ring. By mapping their energy potential surface, we investigated the preference for boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. DFT was utilized alongside NBO analysis to explore the enhanced stability of boat&#8208;like conformers, also considering the influence of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms. Additionally, charge density distribution analysis using QTAIM identified key atoms contributing to stability changes. These findings will help to comprehend this behavior in the drug discovery process when conformationally restricted nucleosides are involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and Reusable Pd/Cu&#160;Bimetallic Nanoparticle&#160;Catalysts for the Synthesis of Hydroxy&#160;Isoindolones by Domino C&#8208;H Activation and Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable and reusable bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu&#8208;Binapthyl Nanoparticles) catalyzed synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones has been developed using domino C&#8208;H activation and annulation. The reaction's scope was examined utilizing a variety of N&#8208;alkoxy benzamide/benzothioamide derivatives and benzaldehydes, which yielded moderate to good yields of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones, one of which was used to synthesize the BRD4 inhibitor. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis is added to the model reaction. The Pd/Cu&#8208; Binapthyl nanocatalyst has been recovered and reused up to four times without any major change in particle size and reactivity.&#160;&#160;</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven [3+2] Cycloaddition of Triazine 1&#8208;Oxides with Arynes/Cyclooctyne: Access to Benzisoxazoles/Cyclooctene&#8208;Fused Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and convenient method has been developed for the synthesis of a wide range of isoxazole based heterocycles having diverse functionality by cycloaddition reactions of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides with arynes and cyclooctyne.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;carboxylates of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with in&#8197;situ generated benzynes and naphthyne and also with cyclooctyne that, following extrusion of dinitrogen, form isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;propenoate derivatives in high yields and diastereocontrol. This practical method occurs at room temperature and provides a wide range of isoxazole&#8208;based heterocycles with diverse functionality. 1,2&#8208;Naphthyne, an unsymmetrical alkyne, forms only one regioisomeric product, exemplifying inherent regioselectivity. Although high, stereoselectivity is not 100&#8201;% in most cases, indicating that the loss of dinitrogen is stepwise. Derivative reactions of benzisoxazoles suggest their versatility.

         <title>Synthesis of Molsidomine and Mesocarb Analog via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of N6&#8208;functionalized iminosydnones following a four steps convergent strategy was designed. 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) was used as an activating agent, the whole process being carried out in the solid state in ball&#8208;mills. It offered an efficient and sustainable access to molsidomine and a mesocarb analog, two bioactive iminosydnones.







Abstract
Iminosydnones (ImSyds) have renowned biological activities and attractive chemical properties for chemical biology. However, access to N6&#8208;functionalized iminosydnones involves tricky and hazardous procedures. Thanks to an innovative mechanochemical strategy using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as an activating agent, a straightforward synthesis of molsidomine and of a mesocarb analog, two bioactive iminosydnones, was achieved. The whole process, involving 4 linear steps, was carried out in the solid state by ball&#8208;milling and with safe reagents, offering efficient and sustainable access to N&#8208;carbonylated iminosydnones, in agreement with the principles of green chemistry.

The whole process, involving 4 linear steps, was carried out in the solid state by ball-milling and with safe reagents, offering efficient and sustainable access to N-carbonylated iminosydnones, in agreement with the principles of green chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Ketones by Photocatalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Aromatic Acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones were synthesized from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids by photoredox catalysis. This method involves phosphoranyl radical promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids and hydroacylation of &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes with the generated acyl radicals.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl alkenes are versatile CF3&#8208;containing feedstocks. They have been widely used to construct gem&#8208;difluoroalkene scaffolds through &#946;&#8722;F elimination. The application of &#945;&#8722;CF3 alkenes as trifluoromethylating reagents has been less explored. Herein, we report an efficient route for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated ketones from readily accessed &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids under photoredox catalysis. The reactions proceed by phosphoranyl radical promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids, generating acyl radicals for subsequent hydroacylation of &#945;&#8722;CF3 styrenes. The valuable trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds could be produced in good yields under mild conditions.

6&#8208;Aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines were obtained from N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids using persulfate salt as oxidant via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical relay. Mechanism study suggests involvement of photoredox and energy transfer pathways.







Abstract
A diverse array of 6&#8208;aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines was successfully synthesized using easily obtainable N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids, facilitated by photoredox catalysis. A mechanistic investigation revealed that this methodology might involve both photoredox and energy transfer catalytic cycles, generating acyl radicals that subsequently promote radical relay cyclization.

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement using benzoheterocyclic compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, was studied. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, benzoheterocyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;acetyl group underwent rearrangement of the acyl group directly to the &#945;&#8208;position past the adjacent bridgehead carbon. This environmentally friendly method could be useful in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry, and biochemistry.







Abstract
We employed an amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that direct acylation of the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearrangement to the &#945;&#8208;position across the bridgehead carbon atom under UV&#8722;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and safe. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.

         <title>Synthesis and Optical and Theoretical Characterization of Imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new blue light&#8208;emitting imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were synthesized, and a hypsochromic effect compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines was observed by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies were estimated based on cyclic voltammetry and calculated by density functional theory; they correlate with the optical transition energies. Calculated orbital geometries serve to discuss the observed differences in fluorescence spectra and quantum yields.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Several new blue light-emitting imidazo[5,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinolines were synthesized, and a hypsochromic effect compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolines was observed by UV-vis- and fluorescence spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies were estimated based on cyclic voltammetry and calculated by density functional theory; they correlate with the optical transition energies. Calculated orbital geometries serve to discuss the observed differences in fluorescence spectra and quantum yields.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be too sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!







Abstract
Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K=103&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of 1 could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst 6 which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.

Debenzylation of O&#8208; and N&#8208;benzyl groups was achieved under safe and mild conditions by using B2(OH)4 as an alternative to gaseous hydrogen in the presence of an amphiphilic polystyrene&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) resin&#8208;supported nano&#8208;palladium catalyst (ARP&#8722;Pd) in water. Benzyl groups of a variety of benzylic ethers, esters, carbamates, and amines, including benzyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates and amino acids, were reductively removed in high yields. ARP&#8722;Pd was recovered by simple filtration and reused seven times without a significant loss of its catalytic activity.

Atropisomeric properties of 5N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one with two Ar&#8722;N(CO) axes moving like gears were investigated. The rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) of the axes was strongly influenced by the electronic effect of the p&#8208;substituent on benzoyl, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) increased the stability of the axes. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the electronic effect (the Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups.







Abstract
5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8722;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8722;N(CO) (sp2&#8208;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8722;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8800; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8800; value.

For the rotational isomers (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;) based on the amide bond [N&#8722;C(=O)], the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (a&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) due to the Ar&#8722;N(CO) (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8722;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;6-position and the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;6 (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-substituents (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron-donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; value, whereas the electron-withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This article reports a mild protocol for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Minisci&#8208;type C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of N&#8208;heteroarenes with 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts without using extra acids, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical heteroarylation of 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts with N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields. Various alkyl bromides were converted conveniently into redox&#8208;active thiazolinium salts and subsequently into alkyl radicals by reaction with an excited&#8208;state photocatalyst. This mild protocol permits efficient functionalization of various N&#8208;heteroarenes with a wild range of cyclic and acyclic primary and secondary alkyl groups.

         <title>Decatungstate Catalyzed Benzylic C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a decatungstate catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond. The reaction features mild conditions and good functional group tolerance, generating corresponding products in moderate to good yields with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents.







Abstract
Here we report a mild protocol for benzylic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation using sodium decatungstate (NaDT) as the photocatalyst. Wherein, photoactivated DT abstracted the benzylic hydrogen atom via a radical process. This transformation works well with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents for better purification. The reaction shows mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

An organocatalytic direct aldol reaction of &#945;&#8208;azido ketones and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyruvate for the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;CF3 organoazides with contiguous tetrasubstituted carbons is described, providing access to valuable multifunctional trifluoromethyl organoazides in good to excellent yields, with moderate diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
A direct diastereoselective aldol reaction of cyclic or acyclic &#945;&#8208;azido ketones with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl (CF3) pyruvate catalysed by DABCO is developed, which allowed the facile access of CF3&#8208;containing multifunctional organoazides with vicinal tetrasubstituted carbons in good to high yields and diastereoselectivities. Moreover, phenylethynyl trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones are also viable substrates. Up to 50&#8201;% enantioselectivity could be obtained in the initial exploration of the catalytic asymmetric variant.

We have sythesized naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir&#8208;catalyzed oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furans.







Abstract
Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.

         <title>Leveraging Propargyl Sulfides as Radical Trappers for the Synthesis of Sulfonyl Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>

This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a radical trapping methodology. An array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.







Abstract
This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a pioneering radical trapping methodology. A diverse array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions with commendable levels of chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the subsequent elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work showcases a novel visible-light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a pioneering radical trapping methodology. A diverse array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions with commendable levels of chemo- and regio-selectivity. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the subsequent elimination of S-centered radicals, and Cl-atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 26, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles is disclosed that proceeds under additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction utilizes readily available alkenes as alkylating partners and delivers Markovnikov products with tolerance of sensitive functionalities.







Abstract
The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.

The Front Cover demonstrates the hypsochromic effect upon changing the basic structure of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines to imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Depending on the electric properties, this change also results in a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield. Here 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;pyridyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline (4CNPhPhiIC) is shown; it has a quantum yield of 48&#8201;% in solution, which is the highest reported for this class of compounds.

This review article provides a chronological overview of the 23 structurally diverse daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated to date and highlights the various synthesis contributions that have been published to date on this unique group of alkaloids.







Abstract
The Daphniphyllum alkaloids represent a particularly diverse class of complex diterpene alkaloids, which are characterized by their enormous structural diversity. The daphnicyclidins, a subgroup of these alkaloids, stand out due to their unique pentafulvene structural motif. This review article gives an overview of the compounds that have been isolated so far and can be assigned to this subgroup. Furthermore, all synthesis approaches and total syntheses published to date are presented.

         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric [3+2] cyclization of isatin&#8208;derived MBH carbonates with p&#8208;QMs was successfully executed utilizing DMAP&#8208;derived catalysts. This process afforded bisspiro(oxindole)s, featuring both cyclopentene and cyclohexadienone motifs, in good yields and enantioselectivity as well as excellent diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A straightforward [3+2] annulation method for synthesizing bisspiro(oxindole) derivatives has been developed by using isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates and p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the catalyst. The optimized protocol in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent achieves good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). The versatility of the method is shown through the synthesis of various derivatives, including chiral variants with up to 82&#8201;% ee. The intermediates were captured by HRMS, and a plausible reaction pathway was proposed.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Pyridone ribo&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides via Heck Reaction and Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective method for the synthesis of ribo&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides is described that relies on a Heck reaction, followed by epoxidation with TFDO, desilylation and reduction with borohydride to give access to this important class of compounds without the need for reaction conditions incompatible with reactive groups or separation of anomers.







Abstract
Nucleosides find applications in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and diagnostics. Among the nucleosides, C&#8208;nucleosides have attracted particular attention because their carbon&#8208;carbon bond between nucleobase and ribose provides stability against degradation. While several well&#8208;established methods exist for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides, the preparation of their ribofuranosyl counterparts is more challenging. Established methods for their synthesis give mixtures of anomers and require harsh reagents or conditions. Here we report a diastereoselective glycosylation method involving a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aryl iodide, followed by oxidation of the silyl enol ether with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO). The resulting ketone is then diastereoselectively reduced to the ribonucleoside. The new route has been applied to pyridones and is expected to also yield other ribo&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides in diastereoselective fashion.

An array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols were synthesized using iodohydroxylation of gem&#8208;difluorinated allyl aryl ethers followed by epoxidation and ring&#8208;opening with an amine in a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step fashion. This approach allows the synthesis of a set of gem&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1 mol % of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethoxylation of Arynes Using 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxybenzene) as Trifluoromethoxide Anion Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trifluoromethoxylation of arynes has been little reported in the literature mainly due to the limited number of stable trifluoromethoxide anion sources existing. We describe herein the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes using 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as a cheap and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use source of F3CO&#8722;. The released trifluoromethoxide anion was used as both a source of fluoride to generate the aryne and a nucleophile for the trifluoromethoxylation reaction.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy moiety, an emerging fluorinated group, shows interesting properties for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. However, only few methods have been reported for the direct introduction of this group on molecules with high efficiency, safety and low cost. Indeed, most of direct trifluoromethoxylation reagents are either expensive, hazardous or require preliminary synthesis before their use. Here we describe the use of 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, safe, commercially available and cheap source of trifluoromethoxide anion for the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes.

         <title>CO&#8208;Boosted Protocol for the Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Thiolation of Aldehydes Using Phenylthiobenzenesulfonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formyl C&#8722;H thiolation of aldehydes using phenylthio benzenesulfonate was achieved using a decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst under CO atmosphere, giving good yields of thioesters.







Abstract
The formyl C&#8722;H thiolation of aldehydes using thiosulfonates and the decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst is reported. Using this photocatalytic protocol together with a CO atmosphere, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields. The transformation consists of a cascade of double SH2 reactions, HAT and an ArS group transfer. CO atmosphere effectively limits the extent of decarbonylation of acyl radicals that are generated in the reaction.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of Cyanoformamides from Isocyanates and a Highly Reactive Nitrile Anion Reservoir</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct addition of a nitrile anion to isocyanates is reported for a straightforward preparation of valuable cyanoformamides. Through the proper activation of an adequate silicon&#8208;ate complex precursor (PhMe2SiCN) with a Lewis base (potassium tert&#8208;amylate) under Barbier&#8208;type conditions, the cyanide was instantaneously released, thus yielding the desired motif with full chemocontrol. No particular structural restriction was noticed for engaging in the transformation a wide series of commercially available isocyanates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This work reports a photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;trifluoroalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;heteroarylation of various alkenes using CF3COONa as an inexpensive trifluoromethylation reagent. More than 29 examples of 3&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one compounds were prepared in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
We herein disclose a direct and practical photocatalytic three&#8208;component &#945;&#8208;trifluoroalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;heteroarylation of various unactivated alkenes with trifluoroacetates and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. The reaction takes place via a photoinduced LMCT process, allowing efficient synthesis of a variety of 3&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8210;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8208;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Disrupting Substance Use Disorder: The Chemistry of Iboga Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iboga alkaloids are a family of monoterpene indole alkaloids first discovered from the root of Tabernanthe iboga. The major alkaloid constituent in the root, ibogaine, has garnered interest for its anti&#8208;addictive properties. Ibogaine has been shown to reduce opiate, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine self&#8208;administration in rodents. However, ibogaine itself is less than optimal as a treatment in humans for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD) due to its cardiotoxicity and hallucinogenic potential. Alternatively, it is an attractive lead for drug discovery efforts. Several notable programs have been launched to both elucidate ibogaine&#8217;s mechanism of action and reduce its toxicity. While there have been over twenty total syntheses of ibogamine, ibogaine, and closely related family members, there are far fewer syntheses of recently isolated iboga alkaloids. In this targeted review, we discuss the synthetic strategies applied to the synthesis of classical and non&#8208;classical iboga alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis Reactions Catalyzed by Organic Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis reaction is a powerful method for the synthesis of a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now report on the development of a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed protocol for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction. Our studies revealed that methanol is a highly efficient solvent and that a very broad range of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support the proposed halogen&#8208;bond interaction. Furthermore, the halogen&#8208;bond protocol is compared with other available catalytic systems for these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Ring&#8208;Closing Reactions of Aminocyclohexane Derivatives Bearing Unsaturated Side Chains at C2: Stereocontrolled Approaches to cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;Fused Perhydro&#8208;indoles and &#8208;Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;protected cyclohexamines bearing acrylate residues attached at C2 have been investigated for their capacities to undergo base&#8208;promoted intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions. Three of these substrates do so both efficiently and completely diastereoselectively. Simple manipulation of the product perhydroindoles and decahydroquinolines afford ready access to novel analogues of the potent neurotoxin pumiliotoxin C.







Abstract
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;Ts&#8208;protected cyclohexylamines that incorporate an unsaturated side&#8208;chain at the C2 position have been prepared. Contrary to expectations, none of these underwent clean, photochemically&#8208;induced intramolecular hydroamination reactions to give the corresponding perhydro&#8208;indole or &#8208;quinolines. However, they did participate in efficient olefin cross metathesis (OCM) reactions with methyl crotonate. Three of the four acrylates so&#8208;formed engaged in base&#8208;promoted and completely diastereoselective, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition (cyclization) reactions to give the isomeric and C2&#8208;substituted perhydro&#8208;indoles or &#8208;quinolines with the structures of these being confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. DFT calculations generated results consistent with the observed diastereoselectivities and the proposed transition states. Manipulation of the ester groups associated with the cyclization products allowed for their conversion, inter alia, into the corresponding n&#8208;propyl residues and thus providing novel analogues of neurotoxic alkaloids such as pumiliotoxin C.

         <title>Amidation of &#946;&#8208;Keto Sulfonyl Fluorides via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol has been developed for amide bond construction using &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides as the acyl surrogates. These readily available BKSFs can be reacted with a variety of amines in presence of N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, producing the desired amides with diverse functionalities.







Abstract
A simple protocol for amide bond construction using &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides (BKSFs) as the acyl surrogates has been achieved. The reaction of BKSFs with a range of amines could be performed in presence of N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), affording various amides with diverse functionalities. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the dibromo&#8208;substituted sulfonyl fluorides could be the key intermediate in this amidation process.

         <dc:description>A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

Many efforts have been made towards the development of novel, sustainable, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute and industrially friendly processes. A novel iodonium&#8208;salt&#8208;mediated oxidation protocol for the conversion of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides is reported, employing DMSO as the oxidant. Several sulfides decorated with various functional group were tested, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields with remarkable chemoselectivity. The oxidative protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) Sulforaphane and Modafinil.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenoureido Calix[6]arenes: A Novel Platform for Pseudorotaxane Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described the synthesis and characterisation of a heteroditopic calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenyl selenoureido groups at the upper rim of the macrocycle. A detailed investigation using NMR, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis and cyclic voltammetry suggested its use as a novel platform for pseudorotaxane synthesis.







Abstract
Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are widely employed macrocycles for the synthesis of pseudo&#8208;oriented interlocked systems and stimuli&#8208;induced molecular machines, among others. Herein, we introduce a new calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenylselenoureido groups. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding donor moieties are able to promote the threading of viologen&#8208;based organic axles inside the macrocyclic cavity to form a stable pseudorotaxane species. Preliminary investigations using 1H&#8208;NMR measurements and semi&#8208;empirical and DFT studies suggested its further use as a platform for the synthesis of rotaxanes.

         <title>I Bind It That Way &#8211; Bioorthogonal Unmasking of Profluorescent Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies for the bioorthogonally controlled generation of pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone&#8208;methides are presented here. The novel concept relies on a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit that chemically cages a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor. On a synthetically readily accessible model compound we demonstrate that IEDDA reaction of the tetrazine with a TCO leads to the liberation of a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide, which is readily captured by nearby nucleophiles to form a fluorescent scaffold. Unlike in previous approaches to access bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenic probes, where the tetrazine unit acted as a quencher of fluorescence, the role of the tetrazine is redefined here. Such repurposed role of tetrazines is foreseen to address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red / NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8208;N/C&#8208;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors&#160;and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts.&#160;&#160;Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed.&#160;&#160;The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in&#160;waste production.
Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process.&#160;&#160;It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH&#8323;CN) in a 1:1:1 ratio, with CH&#8323;CN served as a starting material&#160;rather than a solvent.&#160;&#160;This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition.&#160;&#160;Complete conversion was carried out at 25 &#176;C for&#160;1.0&#160;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88% yields.&#160;&#160;This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour.&#160;&#160;It possesses a compelling&#160;E&#160;factor and impressive volume productivity.&#160;&#160;This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of para&#8208;Quinones: A Historical Review and New Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct functionalization of quinones has always fascinated research communities due to their biological and redox activities and subsequent application. In this review, we have assembled all the recent advancements made towards the direct functionalization of quinones. Most of the synthesized quinone derivatives have applications in biological activities, flow batteries, catalysis, and so on.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of quinones has always fascinated research communities due to their biological and redox activities and subsequent application. Quinone motifs play a vital role as precursors for many bioactive compounds and materials; hence, many ingenious methodologies have been elaborated for exploring these units. A significant part of the synthetic strategies towards the functionalized quinones has been achieved by installing substituents on hydroquinones, phenols, or quinone itself by different oxidative coupling reactions via radical pathways with or without the utilization of metal catalysts. The functionalization of simple quinones via direct C&#8722;H bond remains challenging due to their inherited electronic nature and high bond dissociation energy. This review article summarizes the recent advancement made for functionalized quinones through direct functionalization of simple quinones. Our primary focus will be on the synthetic approaches and mechanistic pathways of these reactions that have appeared in the last two decades, along with a short historical importance of the quinone family.

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity is the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8211;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway.







Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8722;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et&#8197;al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.

         <title>Supramolecular Chemistry: Exploring the Use of Electronic Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the use of electronic structure methods to understand noncovalent interactions in supramolecular systems and the chemical reactions that occur within their chemical space. It also highlights the use of molecular dynamics and machine learning techniques in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
This review aims to highlight the role that computational chemistry has played in advancing the supramolecular chemistry field. We demonstrated recent uses of computational methodologies to elucidate noncovalent interactions in various processes occurring in supramolecular systems. We also emphasized the contributions of these techniques to studying reactions within confined space, showing how computational methodologies help clarify the effects of reactivity and conformational locking. Furthermore, we underscore the utilization of Molecular Dynamics (MD) in elucidating dynamical processes, understanding temperature and pressure effects, and exploring conformational space within supramolecular chemistry. Finally, we highlight the impact that the age of machine learning has on computational chemistry, showing how these universal approximators can enhance existing methods, predict properties, and efficiently explore the chemical space encompassed by these complex systems.

         <title>Deprotonative Metallation of Benzofuran and Benzothiophene Derivatives for the Formation of Tetracyclic and Pentacyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed lithium&#8208;copper and lithium&#8208;zinc amides were successfully used to deprotometallate benzofuran and benzothiophene and thus functionalise these heterocycles. The introduction of iodine atoms enabled subsequent C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions, leading to novel heteroaromatic polycyclic derivatives with specific electrochemical or biological properties.







Abstract
N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzofuran&#8208; and N,N&#8208;dialkylbenzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides were readily prepared from bare benzofuran and benzothiophene by deprotocupration followed by trapping with N,N&#8208;dialkylcarbamoyl chlorides. They were reacted with 2&#8208;benzofuryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;benzothienyllithiums to form symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylketones, or underwent deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences at their 3 position. From 3&#8208;iodinated derivatives, copper&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;arylation of azoles was performed, followed by lithium amide&#8208;promoted cyclisation, to give &#8216;tripentone&#8217; analogues. The diarylketones were also iodinated at their 3,3&#8217; positions and then engaged in the copper&#8208;promoted double N&#8208;arylation of anilines, giving rise to a family of original pentacyclic derivatives. A preliminary assessment of their electrochemical and biological properties was carried out, showing promising results against the proliferation of melanoma cells.

         <title>High Yield Synthesis of Spirocyclic Dienones from Phenols Employing Tribromide Catalysed Dearomatization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative attempts to convert planar arenols to structurally complex entities have been an enthusiastic goal. In this report we elaborate the employability of tribromide catalysis towards dearomative attempts of arenols to spirocyclic dieneones. The facile reaction conditions of the transformation make it the best of the available ones.







Abstract
A catalytic strategy towards the tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization reaction is described employing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and oxone as an oxidising agent. This methodology leads to the exclusive formation of spirofurano dienones without rearomatization or halogenation. Our group has been on trails of tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative transformation during the last decade, and now this exhibits the first report which delivers high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and good diastereoselectivity (dr up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1). The oxidation of naphthols as well as phenols is achieved under this mild conditions.

         <title>Difluorocarbene Enables Modular Synthesis of Difluoroalkylated Bicyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward method for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes (BCPs) from [1.1.1]propellane (TCP) through a stepwise procedure has been developed. This process involves nucleophilic addition of organozinc or ArMgBr rea&#8208;gents to TCP, followed by reaction with difluorocarbene to generate BCP substituted difluoroalkylzinc species, which subsequently couple with electrophiles, including allyl/propargyl bromides, (hetero)aryl disulfides, and proton, to provide a wide range of difluoroalkylated BCPs that otherwise are difficult to access through conventional methods. The transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility of this modular synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dichlorocarbonyl compounds were synthesized by facile dichlorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with TCIA&#8208;PPh3 and the resultant amides were converted to ketones. Conformational analyses of the products were performed to confirm our previous hypothesis regarding vicinal dichlorinated carbonyl compounds. The compounds exhibited 1H NMR signals with large coupling constants (7&#8208;11 Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;configuration and small coupling constants (3&#8208;4 Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;configuration. The syn&#8208;pentane interaction enabled rational conformational analysis of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dichlorinated carbonyl compounds, although some interesting exceptions were observed. Consideration of these conformations is helpful in assigning relative configurations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihalogenated carbonyl compounds in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocyanation of Non&#8208;Activated Alkenes Without Handling HCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrocyanation of alkenes can be considered a straightforward methodology that gives access to different functionalized organic chemistry entities. This is due to nitrile's high versatility, which can easily undergo further transformations. However, this process has traditionally employed hazardous hydrogen cyanide as the hydrocyanation agent. Therefore, in the last decades, different protocols have been developed to accomplish this key organic transformation without needing to handle HCN. In this review, we aim to gather the most recent works published in the last couple of decades regarding the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated olefins in the absence of gaseous hydrogen cyanide as nitrile source. In addition, special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanism working in each case.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of C&#8208;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates with Triazolium Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates. Herein we present the design and synthesis of four Safirinium derivatives, their facile conjugation to lysine in solid phase, and incorporation in peptides. The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed.

         <title>Reconstructive Approach to the Regiospecific Synthesis of N9&#8208;Alkylated Purines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regiospecific synthesis of N9&#8208;alkylated purines as novel acyclic nucleosides was developed. This approach is based on reconstructive methodology involving the construction of a target heterocyclic scaffold on a readily available 5&#8208;aminotetrazole moiety, which is subsequently cleaved under reductive conditions due to azido&#8208;tetrazole tautomerism. It appeared that the rate of reduction for the azide fragment in 6&#8208;nitro&#8208;7&#8208;alkylaminotetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines is much greater than the rate of nitro group reduction. Treatment of these heterocycles with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst resulted in the formation of triaminopyrimidines in excellent yields through the reduction of both the azide and nitro group. Triaminopyrimidines were transformed into the desired N9&#8208;alkylated purines, and an analog of the marketed drug penciclovir was synthesized by the developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions Involving Trifluoro Diazo Compounds and Their Surrogates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoro diazo compounds were one kind of attractive building blocks with high reactivity. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction of trifluoro diazo compounds involving trifluoro diazo compounds and their surrogates was a powerful and convenient approach to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds, which are active ingredients in material science, pharmaceutical chemistry and biological science. In most cases, the key process of this type of transformations was the formation of transition&#8208;metal trifluoromethyl carbene species with the release of one molecular N2. Herein, we provide a comprehensive coverage of the recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Fluorinated organic compounds&#160;represent an important and growing family of active ingredients in various fields, including material science, pharmaceutical chemistry and biological science. Developing efficient synthetic methods toward fluorinated organic compounds have attracted much attention. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction of trifluoro diazo compounds were a powerful and convenient approach to afford trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds of value. In this review, the recent progress on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving trifluoro diazo compounds and their surrogates via trifluoromethylated transition&#8208;metal carbene complex is described in the sequence of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane as carbene precursor, ethyl 3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diazo&#8208;propionate as carbene precursor, trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride or amines as the CF3CHN2 surrogate as well as trifluoro aldehydes/ketones N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones as the trifluoro diazo compounds surrogate.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Driven Logic Gates Based on Intramolecular Weak Interactions in Pyridyl&#8208;Containing Diarylnitroxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new stable diarylnitroxide exhibiting redox&#8208; and chemically switchable intramolecular interactions was obtained. The intrinsic electrofluorochromism of its oxoammonium cation rigidified by the intramolecular N&#8722;O bond between the pyridyl lone pair and the O atom was first disclosed. Structural simplicity and facile synthesis of the nitroxide make it promising for creating novel types of redox&#8208;switchable molecular logic gates.







Abstract
A new stable diarylnitroxide with two 2&#8208;pyridyl groups in the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, in the close vicinity to the NO fragment, was obtained. Conformational flexibility of the molecule provides stimuli&#8208;responsive reversible on/off switching of the intramolecular interactions, stabilizing the oxidized and reduced states of the nitroxide (due to the n&#8208;&#960;* interaction and the intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, respectively) and giving rise to novel properties. The intrinsic electrofluorochromism of the oxoammonium cation rigidified by the intramolecular N&#8722;O bond between the pyridyl lone pair and the O atom was first disclosed. Structural simplicity and facile synthesis of the diarylnitroxide make it promising for creating novel types of redox&#8208;switchable molecular logic gates.

         <title>2&#8208; and 3&#8208;Fluorocyclobutane Building Blocks for Organic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;monofluorinated cyclobutane building blocks was disclosed. In both cases, fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids were the key intermediates used to obtain all other derivatives, e.&#8201;g., amines, alcohols, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. For both target chemotypes, diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines were obtained through diastereomer separation. Characterization of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutyl substituents by pKa and LogP measurements for the model derivatives was also performed.







Abstract
Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.

         <dc:description>
A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were prepared by an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of arylhydrazides and arylboronic acids using DMF as the carbonyl source. This reaction involved ligand exchange and transmetalation of copper catalysts with arylhydrazides and arylboric acids, followed by reductive elimination and intramolecular cyclization.







Abstract
A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were prepared by an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of arylhydrazides, arylboronic acids and DMF. Moderate to good yield of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were obtained using DMF as the carbonyl source and arylboronic as the aryl source. This reaction involved ligand exchange and transmetalation of copper catalysts with arylhydrazides and arylboric acids. Compared to the previous work, this work employs the stable and readily available aryl hydrazide and arylboronic substrates that enhance the practicality of this strategy, and this strategy features a short reaction time, relatively low heating temperature, convenient and more secure. Further, this protocol has the features of high functional group tolerance and reaction scalability.

         <title>Organocatalysis for enantioselective decarboxylative nucleophilic addition reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic decarboxylation of malonic acid half oxy&#8208; and thioesters, &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids, and their related compounds is a straightforward, powerful, and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the in&#8208;situ formation of enolates, which are important and well&#8208;studied synthons for various functional materials and natural products. This strategy, inspired by the biosynthesis of polyketides and fatty acids, is an attractive method for synthesizing enols from carboxyl compounds with less reactive &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms under mild conditions. In addition, these reactions are environmentally friendly and are of great interest to chemists because the use of a stoichiometric amount of base can be avoided, and the only byproduct is CO2. Thus far, remarkable progress has been made, especially in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions, allowing for the stereocontrolled formation of new C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;heteroatom, and C&#8211;X bonds. This review provides a comprehensive overview of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions and highlights the significant progress made since 2020. In particular, it focuses on chiral catalyst systems and transition states as key parameters for decarboxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalisation of Chromane by Deprotonative Metallation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the biological interest in chromane derivatives, few studies dedicated to the functionalisation of this heterocycle have been reported. Herein, our objective is to demonstrate the potential of alkali metal bases for the introduction of substituents at its positions 4 and 8, and to explain the observed reactivity based on quantum chemical calculations. Guided by these theoretical results, preliminary optimisation was carried out on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran before applying the optimal conditions to chromane. Deprotolithiation at C8 was thus achieved using n&#8208;butyllithium in hexane at room temperature, while functionalisation at C4 was promoted by a 1:1 mixture of lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide and potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8208;50 &#176;C. Various electrophiles were used to intercept the lithiated intermediates, providing a convenient access to substituted chromane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of the Solvent in the Synthesis of Spirocycles from Alkyne Cations Catalyzed by Triflic Acid: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of discrete solvent molecules in the reactivity of alkyne cations has been analyzed computationally. Analysis of the possible reaction mechanisms towards competitive cyclization and elimination processes including a molecule of solvent show the crucial role of dichloromethane (DCM) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). In the presence of DCM, a strong intramolecular p&#8208;cation interaction between the electrophilic center and the triple bond favors the [5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig] cyclization route, with no direct participation of the solvent in the reaction path. On the contrary, in the presence of a discrete molecule of THF, a strong solvent&#8211;cation interaction via formation of a dative C(+)&#8211;O(THF) bond drastically modifies the energy profile, thus promoting the elimination pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Arylation of Benzoxazoles with Benzoyl Chlorides under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy for the direct arylation of benzoxazoles is described. By treating benzoxazoles with benzoyl chlorides in the presence of DIPEA in DCM/H2O, the corresponding 2&#8208;aryl benzoxazoles were obtained. This procedure was carried out without transition&#8208;metal catalysts or extra oxidants. Notably, the same transformation can also be effected with benzothiazoles.







Abstract
A mild and convenient method for the arylation of benzoxazoles with benzoyl chlorides is reported. This facile protocol used only N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an additive. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a wide range of benzoxazoles and benzoyl chlorides were tolerated. With this strategy, benzothiazoles and benzoyl chlorides also reacted well to afford the desired product 2&#8208;aryl benzothiazoles in moderate yields.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Enhanced Iron Catalysed Hydrosilylation of Carboxamides and Carboxylic Esters at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iron&#8208;catalyzed reduction of carboxamides and carboxylic esters leading to amines and alcohols, respectively, is reported conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2&#215;24&#8197;W, 450&#8211;460&#8197;nm) at ambient conditions in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes).







Abstract
We report herein a blue&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iron&#8208;catalyzed reduction of carboxamides and carboxylic esters. Conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2&#215;24&#8197;W, 450&#8211;460&#8197;nm) in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes), amines and alcohols were obtained, respectively, notably at ambient conditions, whereas using white light, higher reaction temperatures up to 100&#8201;&#176;C were required. Preliminary mechanism studies highlighted the crucial role of blue light not only to generate the catalytic active species, but also in some steps of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>

         <dc:description>
We established an improved synthetic route to TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups and also to longer alkyl chains. How the axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs, is herein explored.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8722;5.2&#8197;eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.&#8201;e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.

         <title>Chemoselective and Triggered Decomposition of Diazo Esters by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] Complex: En Route to Assisted Tandem Catalysis from Mixture of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decomposition of aryl and unsubstituted diazo ester into Rh(II)&#8208;carbenes by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex is shown to be slower than with Rh2(OAc)4. Diazo esters substituted by a second electron&#8208;withdrawing group do not suffer nitrogen extrusion when exposed for several hours to this Rh(II)&#183;NHC complex at room temperature. This chemoselective decomposition of diazo esters depending on their substituent (Ar, H, EWG) can furthermore be&#160;achieved on a mixture of substrates. The catalytic activity of [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] towards electron&#8208;poor diazo compounds is restored by heating to reflux in chloroform, or after decomplexation of the NHC by addition of GaCl3. Following these findings, the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex was used to induce a fully selective reaction cascade from a mixture of two diazo esters. First, a donor/acceptor diazo compound was decomposed&#160;selectively at room temperature to give an intermolecular O&#8208;H insertion product without any decomposition of the electron poor diazo compound. Addition of GaGl3 then&#160;triggered nitrogen extrusion from the diazo malonate to give&#160;a 1,5&#8208;C&#8208;H insertion product. This transformation, where decomposition of diazo compounds catalyzed by Rh(II) complexes can be externally controlled, represents the first example of assisted tandem catalysis with two metal carbene precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Solvate Ionic Liquids in the Enantioselective (S)&#8208;Proline&#8208;Catalyzed Mechanochemical Robinson Annulation.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report our observations from the study of the classical Robinson annulation reaction under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical activation by means of high&#8208;speed ball milling. In particular, the enantioselective synthesis of the Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone was used as model reaction. (S)&#8208;Proline was employed as chiral organocatalyst, either alone or in the presence of additives in order to determine their influence on the reaction&#8217;s speed and stereoselectivity. Most interesting, among the additives that were examined, four solvate ionic liquids (SIL) afforded the desired product with significantly improved enantioselectivity relative to the mechanochemically&#8208;activated reaction catalyzed by (S)&#8208;proline alone. Furthermore, the required reaction time was reduced from 3 days to 90 min. The potential of other proline&#8208;type organocatalysts was explored in this ball&#8208;milling process. &#160;Initial attempts to increase the scope of the reaction to afford related annulation products were unsuccessful. HPLC&#8208;MS experiments were carried out in order to detect some of the species that intervene in the mechanism of the (S)&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed Robinson cyclization reaction involving 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexanedione and methyl vinyl ketone.</dc:description>

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8225;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical enabled construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes via unprotected amide radical or radical anion. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.







Abstract
N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Sufur&#8208;Containing Flavones: Synthesis of Sulfoxide/Sulfone&#8208;Flavonoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol is proposed for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. The combination of oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO&#8201;4&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as the sole oxidant and NaHCO3/Na2CO3 as the buffer play an important role in the process, in which the amounts of oxone and reaction temperatures are the key to the outstanding selectivities and high efficiency of the reaction. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium Formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cesium formate mediated remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines were developed under mild reaction conditions in absence of external photocatalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the cesium formate act as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion and hydrogen atom donor.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in&#8197;situ generated aryl radical is converted to &#945;&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.

         <title>Phthalimide and 3&#8208;Formylindole Derivatives for Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Amide or Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalimide&#8208;hexyl or 3&#8208;formylindole&#8208;hexyl phosphoramidites and solid supports on a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane scaffold were used to introduce an amine or aldehyde function into oligonucleotides for conjugation by amide bond or oxime ligation.







Abstract
A phthalimide or 3&#8208;formylindole functionality was incorporated into a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (THME) scaffold, and the resulting compounds were subsequently transformed into phosphoramidites and solid supports. These building blocks were then used to synthesise oligonucleotides containing amine or aldehyde groups at various positions within their sequences. The resulting modified oligonucleotides were further conjugated through either amide bond formation or oxime ligation. These novel building blocks expand the repertoire of phosphoramidites and solid supports available for modifying oligonucleotides.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Silanes with SF6 for Efficient Synthesis of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of siloxanes via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of silanes with SF6 has been established, exhibiting broad substrate scope and high efficiency.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as distinctive oxidant and water as the oxygen source to transform silanes into siloxanes has been developed under mild conditions, realizing the efficient utilization and degradation of the strong greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, simultaneously. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, and it has been confirmed that the oxygen atoms in the resulting siloxanes indeed originate from water by isotopic labeling experiments with 18O.

         <dc:description>The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. Compared with the indirect methods, direct trifluoromethylsulfinylation by employing available trifluoromethylsulfinylating reagents is an important and elegant strategy for the rapid assembly of valuable CF3S(O)&#8208;derived organic molecules. This review focuses on the recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods in this area.

         <title>Controlled Reactivity of Viologens in Alkaline Solutions Via &#160;Cucurbit[7]uril Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and N&#8208;aryl&#8208;viologens has been studied in alkaline solutions. In this work, we evaluated the deuteration rate of the viologens in D2O solutions of pH values ranging from 7.3 to 12.7. Kinetic experiments and computational calculations showed the high reactivity of H&#8208;C(2) bonds toward deprotonation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium moieties compared to N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;pyridinium moieties, even in hybrid N&#8208;aryl/N&#8208;alkyl dissymmetric viologens. However this high H&#8208;C(2) reactivity in liquid phase contrasted with the proton fragmentation mechanism observed in the gas phase by mass spectrometry. The H/D exchange rate of viologens in very strong alkaline conditions could be significantly reduced using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) as supramolecular protecting group. Ultimately, CB[7] inclusion led to a selective protection of H&#8208;C(2) group of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium of dissymmetric viologens, and induced a supramolecular regioselective deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lactones via Electrochemical Sequential Oxidative Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we unveil a novel electrochemical oxidative strategy that facilitates the synthesis of lactones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acids. Crucially, our method allows for the convergent synthesis of lactones from the combinations of the respective 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid as starting material, owing to the oxidative process's compatibility within our electrochemical setup. This approach offers a robust and versatile pathway to construct various dibenzopyranones type lactone compounds through an environmentally considerate and economically advantageous process.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation/Mumm Rearrangement towards Imides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize imides was reported. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We report an electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize the corresponding imides. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective oxidation of aliphatic carboxylic acids appears to be the key step in this transformation.

         <dc:description>the electrochemical stereoselective dehydrogenative homocoupling of b&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives was investigated and successfully accomplished, the chiral diaryl amines being obtained in up to 60% yield. The use of an enantiopure b&#8208;naphthylamine featuring an aminoalcohol as chiral auxiliary led to the expected 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl diamine derivative in up to 96/4 diastereoisomeric ratio. The application of the methodology to the intramolecular cross coupling of the enantiopure bis&#8208;N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthylamine 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;diamino cyclohexane led to the formation of a single enantiopure diastereoisomer in 37% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: A Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;methyltetrahydropyran (4&#8208;MeTHP) as reaction medium have been highlighted in two organometallic&#8208;mediated transformations performed under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable stability of the organolithium species involved in the anionic Fries rearrangement of binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208;carbamates, and superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other sustainable solvents have been disclosed in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;(bis)carboxamide derivatives.







Abstract
We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP constitutes a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction medium are illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents are observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high stereoselectivity, working at 0&#8201;&#176;C and under air.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8210;H activation methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>EDA Complex from BCP&#8208;Thianthrenium Salt: A Catalyst&#8208;Free Strategy To Access 1&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline Derivatives Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example used BCP thianthrenium salts to construct an EDA complex, providing a catalyst&#8208;free and mild protocol to obtain 1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline derivatives bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes in high yields under photo&#8208;induced condition (36 examples), with structural modifications to the bioactive molecule derivatives also successfully implemented.







Abstract
The construction of bicyclo[1.1.1.]pentanes (BCPs) typically require the cumbersome use of labile [1.1.1.]propellane in solution and involve multicomponent radical reactions, which commonly produce undesired by&#8208;products that hinder the efficient construction of BCPs. In this paper, we present a catalyst&#8208;free strategy by constructing an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron&#8208;deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl&#8208;BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.

         <title>In DFT We Trust: Exhaustive Exploration of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions Between Nitrones and Levoglucosenone Exposes a Curious Case of Conformational Dynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An experimental and computational study (including DFT calculations and distortion/interaction analysis) was conducted to assess the effect of the nitrone structure in the outcome of dipolar 1,3&#8208;cycloadditions with levoglucosenone, a biomass derived chiral enone. While B3LYP/6&#8208;31G* (the most popular method for modeling these reactions according to our literature search) provides qualitatively good results, large outliers were found for some systems. An exhaustive exploration of other levels allowed us to determine the most appropriate ones to predict simultaneously reactivity and selectivity. The systematically predicted high exo selectivity by the majority of the levels led us to reconsider our initial assignment for the reaction with the nitrone derived from piperidine, which resulted in the discovery of an interesting case of conformational dynamics.</dc:description>

Synthesis of substituted pyrazines from readily available methyl aryl/heteroaryl ketones and 1,2&#8208;diamines were achieved using highly stable and reusable ferrite stabilized copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4&#8208;CuO) as catalyst. The reaction proceeds via cascade imine formation&#8208;oxidative cyclization method under oxygen atmosphere. The nanocatalysts were easily recovered and reused upto three consecutive cycles without any significant decrease in particle size, catalytic activity and reaction yield as evidenced from analytical techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD). The synthesized pyrazines exhibited photophysical ,&#160;behaviour, displayed large stoke shift and explored as fluorescent probe for the sensitive as well as selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; detection of iron with a limit of detection of 0.63 &#181;M. The sensing method has also useful for the quantification of iron in spiked water samples. Furthermore, the application of luminescent pyrazine as fluorescent ink was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The total syntheses of gochnatiolide D and ainsliadimer A were achieved through a streamlined one&#8208;pot sequence starting from their biogenetic precursor dehydrozaluzanin C. These biomimetic, protecting group&#8208;free syntheses involve the elegant orchestration of the highly diastereoselective hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of dehydrozaluzanin C, its subsequent hydrolysis to gochnatiolide D and finally an aldol reaction to ainsliadimer A, all harnessed by the hydrogen bond propensity and acidity of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which was utilized as the reaction solvent.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regiospecific C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under modified aerobic Mukaiyama hydration conditions is presented. The new methodology can be regarded as an equivalent of a two&#8208;step process, a typical hydration of the parent allylic alcohol followed by a 1,2&#8208;diol cleavage. A broad scope of substrates, both cyclic and acyclic, are applicable, thus introducing substantial structural modification to the core, especially of the former type of substrates. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction reveals the importance of the nearby hydroxyl group for the deviation from the typical Mukaiyama hydration pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines constitute an accessible class of lead&#8208;like heterocycles with a vast application in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Polysubstituted NH Pyrroles from Nitroalkenes via [4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition/Reductive Ring Contraction Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel two&#8208;step access to polysubstituted pyrroles from nitroalkenes was developed. It involves [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with enol ethers to give six&#8208;membered cyclic nitronates followed by reductive ring contraction with Ra&#8208;Ni/AcOH or Ra&#8208;Ni/EtOH systems. The process is applicable to a variety of nitroalkenes and enol ethers bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substituents and functional groups. The anti&#8208;inflammatory drug Bimetopyrol and its structural modifications were successfully synthesized by the strategy developed. The key side products were identified that provided an insight into the mechanism of the developed reductive ring contraction to pyrroles.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Formyl Group Migration Triggered Remote Desaturation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photocatalytic formyl group migration&#8208;triggered remote desaturation is realized, producing a library of functionalized trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. The controllable installation of three functional groups, such as CF3, CHO, and a C&#8722;C double bond, provides a very attractive protocol for rapid synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8722;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation. It provides a good complementary approach to the existing desaturation protocols.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;Diketones towards Catalytic Asymmetric Domino Michael&#8211;Henry Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explored a method to distinguish between both enolizable regions of unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diketones in organocatalytic domino reactions involving nitroalkenes. The selective formation of an enamine from only one side of the molecule was made possible by the use of optically pure 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine. This catalyst, remarkably enhancing the reaction, owes its efficacy to a unique interplay between basicity and nucleophilicity. These features caused the enolization of the substrate at the second possible site to be omitted. The approach resulted in excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (91&#8208;99% ee) across various nitroalkenes, leading to the synthesis of novel cyclopentanone derivatives with three contiguous stereogenic center.</dc:description>

This efficient methodology enables access to chiral &#945;,&#945;-disubstituted &#945;-amino ester derivatives with two adjacent stereocenters, one of them quaternary, bearing a benzofuran scaffold in their structure in high yields and stereocontrol.

         <title>Synthesis of (E)&#8208;Enaminoesters by a 1,6&#8208;Addition/Fragmentation Cascade Involving Coumalic Acid Esters and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumalic acid methyl ester (methyl coumalate), a biomass&#8208;derived building block, was converted into (E)&#8208;enaminoesters by an original uncatalyzed stereoselective 1,6&#8208;addition/fragmentation cascade involving secondary amines. The transformation occurred under useful experimental conditions as a simple heating of a stoichiometric mixture of the starting compounds led to the desired products. The reaction could be extended to a range of alkyl coumalates and a variety of secondary amines. Given the original character of the transformation, the reaction mechanism was discussed. Therefore, the cascade is supposed to involve a 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition followed by a fragmentation sequence leading ultimately to the decarboxylative elimination of (E)&#8208;enaminoesters. Using this procedure, renewable coumalic acid proved to be a valuable alternative to fossil fuel&#8208;based propiolates for the preparation of enaminoesters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Deoxy Pyranosides via Fe(III) Catalyzed Regioselective Thiocarbonylation of Partially Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid and efficient synthesis of targeted deoxygenated glycosides is highly desired. Herein, we disclose a two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars from partially protected pyranosides via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation. The selectivity can be smoothly achieved through FeCl3 as the catalyst assisted by low&#8208;priced benzoyl trifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) ligand in the presence of K2CO3 as base. Further deoxygenation can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents in traditional procedures. Conspicuous features of this method include mild conditions, easy operation, high selectivity and non or low toxic reagents, making it a more attractive strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Antifungal Agent Voriconazole via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;Alkene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of voriconazole, a synthetically challenging antifungal agent was achieved in nine steps with a 8&#8201;% overall yield. This novel strategy relied on the precise synthesis of tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol and the subsequent highly efficient epoxidation to establish the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.







Abstract
A concise asymmetric synthesis of triazole antifungal agent voriconazole is described. Salient features of this synthesis include a LiOH&#8208;controlled highly stereospecific formation of (Z)&#8208;enol triflate from 2&#8208;difluorobenzene acetoacetate to access the crucial tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol, and a highly enantioselective VO(OiPr)3/BHA ligand&#8208;catalyzed epoxidation to construct the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Free&#160;Approaches to the Direct Arylation of&#160;Benzoquinones and&#160;Naphthoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in situ from phenolic precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Lewis Acids in the Catalytic Activity of Urea&#8208;Based Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations have been carried out to understand both the origin of the catalysis in the urea&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of nitrocyclopropanes and the acceleration induced by the presence of an internal Lewis acid in the catalyst. To this end, the mode of activation of these ureas is quantitatively analyzed in detail by means of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity in combination with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. It is found that the presence of the Lewis acid in the urea further enhances the interaction between the reactants, by increasing both the electrostatic and orbital attractions, which translates into a reduced activation barrier. This insight is also used to assess the impact of the nature of the Lewis acid on the transformation, facilitating the rational design of more active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>(Radio)Fluorination Reactions for the Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8208;F) bonds is an important research field in organic synthesis because the insertion of a fluorine atom into an organic compound can alter its physicochemical properties, such as metabolic stability and permeability. Due to this unique property, organic fluorinated compounds, especially aryl fluorides, have a wide range of applications in various fields, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Therefore, numerous metal&#8208; or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated fluorination reactions have been developed to synthesize aryl fluorides. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize recent ten years&#8217; advances in fluorination reactions for the synthesis of aryl fluorides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted lawsones using a catalytic amount of Sc(OTf)3 in toluene at &#8208;78 &#176;C through a Buchner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck reaction. It is a versatile method to produce a large number of 3&#8208;aryl, 3&#8208;styryl, 3&#8208;alkyl, and 3&#8208;heteroaryl substituted lawsones under mild conditions. This is a first report on the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted lawsones in high to excellent yields in short reaction times.</dc:description>

This is a first report on the synthesis of 3-substituted lawsones in high to excellent yields in short reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloaddition reactions are powerful &#8216;reagentless&#8217; transformations that form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. By judicious tether design in combination with continuous flow it is demonstrated that substrates with a four&#8208;membered tether can also undergo meta&#8208;photocycloaddition in good yield, enabling access to natural product skeletons.







Abstract
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to three&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a four&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo exciplex (1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles were accessed through the tandem copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by a copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative dehydrogenative aromatization reaction in air. Fully substituted pyrroles could then be obtained by N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion is important yet challenging. Herein, we report a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction involving 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles in up to 81&#8201;% yield under green reaction conditions. A possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles are available by N&#8208;alkylation, and a preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation was also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent tandem cyclization and aromatization approach is introduced for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles from &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones, respectively. Styrene derivatives were employed to generate one&#8208;carbon synthons through C=C bond cleavage, while an ammonium salt served as the nitrogen source and elemental sulfur served both as the sulfur source and oxidant.







Abstract
A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles is described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, an ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state was designed by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto one benzene ring. Our synthetic attempts towards 1 involve both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core were obtained. In the reduction path, a new tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was afforded.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal [4+2] annulation reaction of phthalaldehydes and 3-ylideneoxindoles through a tandem process of a Stetter&#8211;aldol reaction was accomplished by the application N-heterocyclic carbenes as effective catalysts. Under mild conditions, this unprecedented cascade reaction readily occurs in good yield, enabling straightforward access to functionalized tetrahydronaphthalene-fused spirooxindoles. For the first time, the feasibility of an asymmetric Stetter&#8211;aldol reaction has also been briefly explored by employing chiral organic bases to promote the asymmetric transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Derivatives under Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced or electrochemically catalytic functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to construct diverse allyl compounds with valuable groups was reviewed. Through direct 1,4&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;, or 2&#8208;functionalization, a lot of functional groups, such as alkyl groups, nucleophilic reagents, phosphoryl groups, aryl groups, or alkyl alcohol, were introduced in mild, green, and atom&#8208;economy conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene has become an attractive strategy for constructing allyl compounds with molecular and structural complexity, and the current research focuses on synthetic chemistry and organic synthesis. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the synthesis methods promoted by photochemistry or electrochemistry represent an environmentally friendly and mild strategy. In this review, the functionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene under photochemical/electrochemical processes in recent years are reviewed according to the classification of functionalization systems, with particular emphasis on the corresponding reaction mechanism, which lays a foundation for further exploration of new catalytic methods.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free C(sp3)&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Glycine Ester Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and environmentally friendly method is proposed for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives by direct irradiation of glycine derivatives and diarylphosphine oxides with blue visible light at room temperature using only air (oxygen) as an oxidant. A possible mechanism was also proposed in conjunction with controlled experiments.







Abstract
We herein report a visible light induced dehydrogenative phosphonylation reaction of glycine derivatives and di&#8208;aryl phosphine oxides. A diverse range of phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives were constructed under ambient condition in the absence of catalyst and additives. A plausible mechanism was also proposed.

         <title>FeF3&#8208;Promoted Radical Fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;Alkenylaryl Isocyanides to Access 2&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for preparing quinolines through iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation was developed. In the presence of FeF3 and Cs2CO3, a variety of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides smoothly underwent the radical fluoroalkylation with perfluoroalkyl iodides to afford biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields. Moreover, the conditions are compatible with nonfluorinated alkyl iodides leading to 2&#8208;alkylated quinolines.







Abstract
An iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides has been developed using readily available perfluoroalkyl iodides as fluoroalkyl source. This cyclization reaction features broad substrate scope and provides a simple and efficient approach for regioselective construction of biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Indirect and Regioselective Phosphonation of Azobenzenes: Toward the Design of Water&#8208;Soluble Photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes enabling the regioselective introduction of the double&#8208;functionalized phophonoacetate motif was developed. The method proved tolerant for a wide range of substituents. Chemoselective hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate function leads to a water&#8208;soluble azobenzene with interesting photophysical properties, holding great promise for the design of water&#8208;soluble photochemical tools for future biological applications.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethylphosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalization tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline were enabled by application of a thermal coupling of nosyl aziridine and indoles in eight steps each, 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. A Friedel&#8208;Crafts type macrocyclization facilitated key C&#8722;C bond formation. Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation of the resultant macrocyclic alkene enabled C&#8722;N bond formation and furnished the completed isoquinuclidine ring system.







Abstract
We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel-Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole-isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio- and diastereoselective hydroboration-oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfo(xo)nium Diacylmethylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides as stable and readily prepared sulfur ylides are versatile synthons. This concept article summarizes their synthetic methods, including the condensation of active methylene compounds with sulfides/sulfoxides, transylidations of diazo compounds and iodonium ylides with sulfides/sulfoxides, acylation of sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and the reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes and sulfoxides. Their substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, limitations, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications. Challenges for further exploration and prospect on sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides in the future are also suggested.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.
