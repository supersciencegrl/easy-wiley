         <title>Manganese &#8208; Catalyzed Regioselective Direct C3 &#8208; Phosphinoylation of 2 &#8208; Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient and regioselective manganese&#8208;catalyzed radical oxidative direct C&#8722;P bond coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones and secondary phosphine oxides was developed. The  C3  &#8208;selective phosphinoylation was conveniently achieved through a combination of a substoichiometric manganese and a persulfate oxidant under mild conditions, giving various 3&#8208;phosphinoylated pyridone products in moderate to high yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to involve a radical pathway induced by catalytically active Mn  3+  species.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their hetero&#8208; and macrocyclic derivatives: preparation and synthetic applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylo&#173;nitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetami&#173;des, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cross dehydrogenative coupling reaction of tetrahydroisoquinolines with 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraoxide had been developed. CuBr/TBHP was identified as the best catalyst and oxidant. A variety of coupling products were obtained with good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. 1&#8208;Monofluoromethyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were prepared via the subsequent desulfonylation with sodium amalgam. This method provides a new synthetic approach to &#945;&#8208;monofluoromethyl tertiary amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Synthesis of 1&#8208;Glycosyl Thioacetates and Its Application in the Synthesis of Thioglucoside Gliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved method to synthesize 1&#8208;glycosyl thioacetates was developed, where per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycoses were allowed to directly react with potassium thioacetate (KSAc) in the presence of BF  3  .  Et  2  O in ethyl acetate under mild conditions. This method not only overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional one&#8208;step method, which is that the odorous and toxic thioacetic acid has to be used, but also overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional two&#8208;step method, which is that the unstable intermediate, glycosyl halide, has to be synthesized from the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycose in advance. Based on this, the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl disulfide and the per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol were efficiently synthesized in high yields (91% and 90% respectively) starting from per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glycoses in two&#8208;step without the need to isolate intermediate products. Through metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of per&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol with aryl&#8208;iodide under very mild conditions, two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were efficiently synthesized in high yields for the first time. These two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were further confirmed to be stable to hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;glucosidase.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion to 8&#8208;Membered Silacycles via Formal Cross&#8208;Dimerization of 5&#8208;Membered Palladacycles with Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigations of the sila&#8208;8&#8208;membered ring&#160;fused biaryls are of important significance for the discovery of new drug&#160;lead&#160;compounds.

Herein we describe the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective cross&#8208;dimerization of 5&#8208;membered palladacycles with silacyclobutanes enabled by Pd&#8208;catalytic conditions, which constitutes an expedient ring expansion route to the sila&#8208;8&#8208;membered ring&#160;fused biaryl skeletons.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. In this study, the left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, was synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity. This stereoselectivity was investigated by computational studies. Further selective transformation provided a tricyclic skeleton with the desired stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient base catalyzed oxacyclization of  Z  &#8208;enynols has been developed under transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, thus resulting in a variety of new di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted furans. This approach allowed us to obtain 32 new compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were realized to depict a relationship between the natural population analysis and experimental results with alkyl or aryl groups for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzylfuran. A one&#8208;pot Sonogashira/oxacyclization approach offers a flexible, robust and efficient alternative to base catalyzed cyclization is also carried out.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <title>The Chemistry of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Hydroperoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Hydroxy hydroperoxides (&#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy alcohols) are interesting chemical platforms, notably for the preparation of 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, that are key features of numerous bioactive products such as artemisinin. In this review, the main synthetic methods to prepare &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are presented, such as the photooxidation of allylic alcohols with singlet oxygen and the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with H  2  O  2  . The main applications of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are also detailed, including their peracetalization to 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, their use as epoxidating agents and their fragmentation to carbonyl compounds. A final section is dedicated to the general characteristics and practical aspects of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides, including their stability, safety and characterization through spectroscopic means.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Aldol Reaction in Continuous Flow Using Gel&#8208;Bound Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2578-2586, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The corresponding in&#8208;depth analysis shows the general and extensive applicability of the MFR concept with an immobilized L&#8208;proline&#8208;based catalyst for carrying out asymmetric aldol reactions with various substrates. Using cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone as well as acetone, various ketones could be successfully converted as donors in the aldol reaction with various substituted aldehydes.







Abstract
Continuous flow catalysis using a microfluidic reactor with gel&#8208;bound proline organocatalysts is an attractive approach in organic synthesis due to interesting advantages such as the permanent production of catalyst&#8208;free products and the easy product isolation by evaporation. Further advantages are the online detection of reactions and an adjustment of reaction parameters while the reaction is already running. Herein the formation of differently substituted aldol products within minutes at mild conditions in good to almost quantitative yields is described. The effects of different solvent mixtures and temperatures on the conversion and selectivity are analyzed in detail by NMR as well as the relationship between the height of the polymer structures and the conversion behavior of the asymmetric aldol reaction of 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone. The applicability of this system is demonstrated for a wide range of differently substituted nitrobenzaldehydes. It is shown that the described reactor setup delivers high conversion and good selectivity over up to 144&#8197;hours and that a highly reusable system was established.

         <dc:description>Two highly emissive donor&#8208;acceptor type organoboron dyes, based on carbazole donor and benzothiazole&#8208;fused oxadiazaborinine acceptor, were designed and synthesized.

Such carbazolyl&#8208;containing  N,  O  &#8208;chelated organoboron dyes exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties: in tetrahydrofuran/water mixture with the high water amount, they formed highly emissive nanoaggregates. Both materials demonstrated efficient solid&#8208;state emission in the crystalline and thin film state (PLQY of up to 48%), as well as significant mechanofluorochromic properties (&#916;&#955;  em  = 30&#8208;38 nm).

         <title>Kinetic and Structure&#8208;Activity Studies of the Triazolium Ion&#8208; catalyzed Intramolecular Stetter Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt  3  /NEt  3  .HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first order in catalyst and zero order in aldehyde over a broad range of aldehyde concentrations. The observed reaction rate is higher for catalysts bearing N&#8208;aryl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. A concurrent, NHC&#8208;independent substrate isomerization was also observed and found to demonstrate a first order dependence on aldehyde concentration. The reported data are consistent with deprotonation to form the Breslow intermediate being turnover&#8208;limiting in this process.</dc:description>

         <title>Strigolactones: Phytohormones with Promising Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Diformylated N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene Hexamers by Macrocyclization with Aromatic Diamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows macrocyclization between N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamers (N&#8208;oP6s) and para&#8208;phenylenediamines through a funnel. Before the reaction, both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helices of N&#8208;oP6s existed due to dynamic nature of the helices. As the reaction proceeds, the diamine selects N&#8208;oP6s with the same&#8208;handedness to make entropically favorable [2+2] macrocycles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Tokoro, T. Oyama et&#8197;al.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling for the Efficient Preparation of Symmetric Diarylalkyne Ligands for Metal&#8208;Organic Cages*</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a public transportation map representing the synthetic trip from an aryl halide to a heterocyclic diarylalkyne ligand. The &#8220;multi&#8208;stop&#8221; route or conventional step&#8208;wise synthesis involves long reaction times and &#8220;stops&#8221; for the isolation of intermediates. In contrast, the reported &#8220;non&#8208;stop&#8221; route via a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling is faster and avoids the formation of Glaser products or &#8220;accidents&#8221;. Application of the ligands in the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic cages is represented by the airport. The map background represents the Kiel fjord area.

         <title>A Kinetic Photometric Assay for the Quantification of the Open&#8208;Chain Content of Aldoses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows two fishermen fishing for the rare fish, eager for the risky treat. Various species are differently eager to give in to temptation, much like various aldoses substantially differ in their open&#8208;chain content (OCC) and consequently in their ease to react as aldehydes. The OCC represents the very small proportions of the aldehyde form (&lt;1%), which is in equilibrium with the dominant ring forms.&#160;Accurate measurement of these OCCs was now accomplished by an operationally simple UV&#8208;based kinetic (ABAO) assay which furnished&#160;OCC values of all native parent aldoses in full consistency with the more complicated literature gold standard. Cover image designed and illustrated by Thomas Blaukovitsch.&#160;More information can be found in the Communication by C. Stanetty et&#8197;al.

The Cover Feature shows a part of the new buildings at the University of Bologna, dedicated to the Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Departments (&#8220;Navile&#8221; site), with people interacting in the balconies and trapeze artists in equilibrium. The external design of the site has been the result of balancing laboratories space and architectonic requirements. Analogously, the interactions between two stacked arenes, and the resulting preference for syn and anti&#8208;conformations is due to the weighted sum of several factors. The importance of dispersive and electrostatic factors has been analyzed by NMR, circular dichroism and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Stable Betulin&#8208;Derived Nitrile Oxides and their Application in Synthesis of Cytostatic Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoid&#8208;Isoxazole Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2557-2577, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrooxidation provides a helping hand to medicinal chemists: despite the highly lipophilic nature of naturally occurring betulin, two synthetic steps on the pathway to lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates could be electrochemically driven. The electrooxidation can be selectively stopped at the stage of nitrile oxides, which are used in the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions providing cytostatic semi&#8208;synthetic triterpenoid derivatives.







Abstract
Novel lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates were designed by direct placing of isoxazole linker at C(17) of triterpenoid. The suggested synthetic sequence demonstrates successful combination of electro&#8208;organic synthesis and conventional approaches. TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrooxidation of betulin to betulinal was developed and optimized at boron&#8208;doped diamond anodes with potassium acetate as inexpensive supporting electrolyte. Betulinal&#8208;derived oxime was further selectively electro&#8208;oxidized at a graphite anode to nitrile oxide, which proved to be stable and isolable species. The same reaction sequence was performed with 3&#946;&#8208;lupane&#8208;3,28&#8208;diol. Nitrile oxides were characterized by 15N NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The isolable nitrile oxides allowed creation of isoxazole library by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with various alkynes. Some of the title conjugates exhibit cytostatic properties against breast cancer cell line MCF7, glioblastoma multiform cell line U&#8208;87 MG and lung carcinoma cell line A549 with growth inhibition (GI50) concentrations up to 11&#8197;&#956;m, while being harmless to immortalized human fibroblasts hTERT (GI50 &gt;100&#8197;&#956;m).

         <title>Synthesis of the Core Structure of Palhinine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2549-2556, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to the core structure of the alkaloid palhinine A is presented. Starting with an easily available 2,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexanone an allyl group was introduced into the 3&#8208;position by a Grignard addition/oxy&#8208;Cope sequence. A subsequent transannular aldol reaction led to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octanone derivative. To fashion the 5&#8208;membered carbocyclic ring of the isotwistane core structure, an intramolecular nitrile oxide alkene cycloaddition was used.







Abstract
We present a strategy to the core structure of the alkaloid palhinine A passing through a 2,5&#8208;difunctionalized cyclohexenone. This enone was prepared by a domino Michael/aldol condensation sequence. An allylation reaction on the cyclohexenone followed by oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement introduced an allyl group at C3. After the generation of an aldehyde function on the terminus of the C5 substituent, an intramolecular aldol reaction led to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octanone. The five&#8208;membered ring of the core structure could be established by an intramolecular nitrile oxide&#8208;alkene [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. Prior to this key transformation, the keto function was converted to an alkene and the allyl group to an oxime.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Syntheses of Amorfrutins A, B, (S)&#8208;D and (R)&#8208;D and Formal Synthesis of Amorfrutin C</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2540-2548, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formal and total biomimetic syntheses of amorfrutin A, B, C and both enantiomers of amorfrutin D are reported through a unified method from a common precursor prepared using a polyketide aromatization reaction.







Abstract
Bibenzyl natural products, such as the amorfrutins, contain a heavily substituted aromatic core and display a diverse range of biological activities (anti&#8208;tumor, anti&#8208;diabetic, antimicrobial, and antibiotic). In this study, we report unified syntheses of amorfrutin A to D either through total or formal synthesis by employing a dual biomimetic strategy of polyketide aromatization followed by remote terpene functionalization. The key core structures were synthesized from &#946;&#8208;keto dioxinone esters through a magnesium(II) mediated regioselective C&#8208;acylation, palladium catalyzed decarboxylative allylic rearrangement, and dehydrative cyclization.

         <title>Brown allylation: application to the synthesis of natural products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric allylation represents an important reaction applied in the natural product synthesis. The stereoselective introduction of an allyl group allows to obtain versatile chiral building blocks, which may further undergo various transformations due to the presence of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. In this review, we address the Brown allylation, which involves the conversion of aldehydes into homoallylic alcohols using B&#8208;allyldiisopinocampheylborane as a chiral reagent. We provide a comprehensive overview of the reaction and highlight its application in the synthesis of natural products, while assessing its performance in comparison to other approaches. The total of 17 syntheses have been described, including the synthesis of biologically active macrolides Disciformycin B, Biselyngbyolide B, Peloruside A and Gliomasolide A, bis&#8208;piperidine alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;Anaferine and Dysoxylactam A.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6a,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.

         <dc:description>Asymmetric detrifluoroacetylative Mannich reactions between &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl  gem  &#8208;diols and fluoroalkyl imines have been developed under operationally convenient conditions.

The Cover Feature shows a young researcher looking into the vast starry sky, accompanied by an NMR spectrometer. The shooting stars represent the fleeting information embedded in rapid irreversible chemical reactions, for example, the base&#8208;catalyzed protodeboronation of penta&#8208;fluorophenyl boronic acid which has a half&#8208;life of 0.12 s. With the aid of a stopped&#8208;flow NMR technique, the researcher is able to capture the information from the rapidly evolving reactions, to gain information that will shed light on the reaction mechanism.

Axially linked yrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (N2Py, N4Py, and BNPy) exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities. The BNPy&#8208;based OLED achieved the best EL performance with a maximum brightness of 3389&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, a maximum EQE of 3.98&#8201;%, a maximum LE of 3.22&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
A series of axially linked pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (N2Py, N4Py, and BNPy) bearing a different number of 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units substituted on pyrene and bis&#8208;pyrene cores were designed and synthesized using palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a stepwise synthetic manner. These molecules were chemically characterized, and their photoelectric properties were explored by spectroscopy, electrochemical and theoretical studies. They exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities. N2Py, N4Py, and BNPy were successfully applied as emitters in solution&#8208;processed OLED devices, which resulted in blue&#8208;green emissions with promising device performance. Particularly, the BNPy&#8208;based device achieved the best EL results with a maximum brightness of 3389&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, a maximum EQE of 3.98&#8201;%, a maximum LE of 3.22&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8197;V.

&lt;p&gt;Axially linked yrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (&lt;b&gt;N2Py&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;N4Py&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BNPy&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities. The &lt;b&gt;BNPy&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;based OLED achieved the best EL performance with a maximum brightness of 3389&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum EQE of 3.98&#8201;%, a maximum LE of 3.22&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8197;V.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of axially linked pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (&lt;b&gt;N2Py&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;N4Py&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BNPy&lt;/b&gt;) bearing a different number of 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units substituted on pyrene and bis&#8208;pyrene cores were designed and synthesized using palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a stepwise synthetic manner. These molecules were chemically characterized, and their photoelectric properties were explored by spectroscopy, electrochemical and theoretical studies. They exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities. &lt;b&gt;N2Py&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;N4Py&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BNPy&lt;/b&gt; were successfully applied as emitters in solution&#8208;processed OLED devices, which resulted in blue&#8208;green emissions with promising device performance. Particularly, the &lt;b&gt;BNPy&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;based device achieved the best EL results with a maximum brightness of 3389&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum EQE of 3.98&#8201;%, a maximum LE of 3.22&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Diversity&#8208;Oriented Approach to Large Libraries of Artificial Macrocycles</title>

A diversity&#8208;oriented approach to macrocycle libraries based on the &#8220;build/couple/pair&#8221; strategy was used to generate a virtual chemical space of 1.8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105 compounds, with a possibility to further expansion via the &#8220;post&#8208;pairing&#8221; modifications. The method relied on a 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence including ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step, with 61&#8201;% overall synthetic efficiency under parallel chemistry conditions.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large artificial macrocycle libraries with a ring size of 13&#8212;18&#8197;atoms relying on the &#8220;build&#8208;couple&#8208;pair&#8221; strategy is disclosed. The &#8220;couple&#8221; phase included three one&#8208;pot steps including consequent amide coupling of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;monoprotected vicinal diamines with two alkenyl carboxylic acids, followed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key &#8220;pair&#8221; step. The scope and limitations of the method were established for all three reagents. In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8722;C&#8722;C&#8722;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to be suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40&#8201;% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61&#8201;% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0&#8197;g).

         <title>PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, the First D2 Symmetric Chiral Tetraphosphane. Synthesis, Metal Complexation, and Application in Homogeneous Stereoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2367-2374, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new chiral phosphane ligand PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS displays an unusual D2 symmetry with four homotopic diphenylphosphane groups exchangeable through C2 symmetry operations. This structure allows the simultaneous complexation of two metal atoms without any strain allowing synchronous operations of the two active centres in homogeneous asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, a new D2 symmetric tetraphosphane based on the [2.2]paracyclophane scaffold, has been synthesized and characterized. The peculiarity of this system is the presence of four homotopic diphenylphosphane groups, exchangeable through C2 symmetry operations and consequently indistinguishable. Their spatial arrangement allows the simultaneous complexation of two metal atoms. Enantiomeric purity was attained at tetra&#8208;phosphane oxide level by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric adducts obtained from the racemate with enantiopure dibenzoyltartaric acids. Alkaline treatment of diastereomerically pure adducts followed by exhaustive P&#8722;O groups reduction with HSiCl3 gave both PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS antipodes in an enantiopure state. They were tested as rhodium ligands in the homogeneous enantioselective hydrogenation of some benchmark unsaturated compounds. Catalytic activity and enantiodiscrimination ability were found comparable to those exhibited by the complexes of the parent bidentate ligand PHANEPHOS, but only half a mole of precious chiral ligand was employed.

         <title>Use of Isopropyl Alcohol as a Reductant for Catalytic Dehydoxylative Dimerization of Benzylic Alcohols Utilizing Ti&#8722;O Bond Photohomolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2474-2478, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium&#8208;catalyzed dehydroxylative dimerization of benzylic alcohols using isopropyl alcohol as a reductant has been realized by photoirradiation. The key step is photohomolysis of the Ti&#8722;O bond, which enables the utilization of isopropyl alcohol as a hydrogen&#8208;atom donor. The reaction can also proceed under visible&#8208;light irradiation in the presence of thioglycolic acid as a ligand.







Abstract
Photohomolysis of Ti&#8722;O bonds is utilized in photocatalytic generation of titanium(III) species for dehydroxylative dimerization of benzylic alcohols under UV&#8208;light irradiation by using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as a stoichiometric reductant. In this reaction, IPA works not as a single&#8208;electron donor as in the photo&#8208;redox catalyzed reactions but as an H&#8208;atom&#8208;donor. The reaction also proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation in the presence of thioglycolic acid as a ligand.

A practical protocol is developed for the one&#8208;pot construction of C&#8722;S(Se) bonds through nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylation of carboxylic acid and aryl dichalcogenides. This approach featured broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylation of carboxylic acids cross&#8208;coupling protocol has been developed for the straightforward C&#8722;S(Se) bond formation. This reaction is promoted by a commercially&#8208;available, user&#8208;friendly, inexpensive, air and moisture&#8208;stable nickel precatalyst. Various carboxylic acids and a wide range of aryl dichalcogenide substrates were tolerated in this process which afforded products in good to excellent yields. In addition, the present reaction can be conducted on gram scale in good yield.

         <title>Formal Aza&#8208;Diels&#8722;Alder Reactions of Spiroindolenines with Electronrich Dienes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2440-2447, May 7, 2021. </description>

Spiroindolenines serve as imine moiety for formal aza&#8208;Dield&#8208;Alder reactions with electron rich dienes. The reaction delivers tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]spiroindolinones as an interesting class of rigid tridimensional polyheterocycles for drug discovery processes. Manipulation of the synthesized compounds encompasses transformation of the functional groups and formation of new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds.







Abstract
Spiroindolenines were employed as cyclic imine substrates in formal aza&#8208;Diels&#8722;Alder reactions with Danishefsky's diene or silyloxy&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;rich dienes for the synthesis of the corresponding tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]spiroindolinones. The reactions occur under mild conditions in the presence of ytterbium triflate as Lewis acidic catalyst delivering the desired compounds in good yield. The reaction results in the preparation of a small library of a new class of conformational constrained heterocyclic derivatives that easily undergo selective and efficient manipulations.

         <title>2&#8208;(8&#8208;Iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxide: Suppressed Reactivity of Iodine Atom and Unusual Temperature Dynamics of the EPR Spectrum</title>

The cross&#8208;coupling of 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene with an organogold nitronyl nitroxide stops at the monoradical with iodine atom at the peri&#8208;position toward the paramagnetic moiety. This arrangement causes a strong distortion of the nitroxide geometry and unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. The latter can be explained by assuming different characteristic temperatures for averaging the anisotropy of the HFC tensors for N and I atoms.







Abstract
While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet's geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify these dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable aiso(127I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with J=8 and 14&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;2&#8197;J&#8901;S1S2).

This C&#8722;H arylation method was applied to the easy synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles.







Abstract
The reactivity of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole in palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation was studied. The reaction conditions for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in moderate to high yields using phosphine&#8208;free Pd(OAc)2 catalyst and inexpensive KOAc base have been found. Then, from these 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization of the C5&#8208;position allowed the synthesis of the corresponding 4,5&#8208;diarylated 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. This selective 4,5&#8208;diarylation of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole was successfully applied for the straightforward building of the &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic heteroaromatic structures phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208; and C5&#8208;intermolecular arylations followed by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H intramolecular arylation.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of an isoDGR&#8208;Paclitaxel Conjugate Containing a Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide to Promote Cellular Uptake</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2383-2387, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new drug delivery system featuring an isoDGR integrin ligand, the CPP sC18, and the cytotoxic drug Paclitaxel was achieved through a &#8220;double click&#8208;reaction strategy&#8221; involving a thiol&#8208;maleimide ligation followed by a copper(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition. In vitro assays against U87 cell&#8208;line showed a significant enhancement of the conjugate anticancer activity compared to the analog devoid of the CPP moiety.







Abstract
Two new Drug Delivery Systems (DDS) cyclo[DKP&#8208;isoDGR]&#8208;PEG&#8208;4&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;PTX (2) and cyclo[DKP&#8208;isoDGR]&#8208;PEG&#8208;4&#8208;sC18&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;PTX (3), containing the cyclo[DKP&#8208;isoDGR] integrin ligand and the cytotoxic agent Paclitaxel (PTX), were synthesized to investigate the influence of a PEG&#8208;4 chain and of the sC18 cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) on the cellular uptake and the cytotoxicity of the constructs. A &#8220;double click&#8208;reaction strategy&#8221; was planned, to realize the connection of cyclo[DKP&#8208;isoDGR] and PTX to the CPP moiety. Anti&#8208;proliferative bioassays were performed on the &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;positive U87 human glioblastoma cell line using a short contact time (15&#8197;min) followed by draining, washing of the cells, and re&#8208;incubation for 72&#8197;h. Compound 3 was significantly more potent (IC50=27.6&#8197;&#956;M) than compound 2 (IC50&gt;100&#8197;&#956;M), and showed a reduced potency loss with respect to PTX (IC50=71&#8197;nM).

&lt;p&gt;Two new Drug Delivery Systems (DDS) c&lt;i&gt;yclo&lt;/i&gt;[DKP&#8208;&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;DGR]&#8208;PEG&#8208;4&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;PTX (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;[DKP&#8208;&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;DGR]&#8208;PEG&#8208;4&#8208;sC18&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;PTX (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), containing the c&lt;i&gt;yclo&lt;/i&gt;[DKP&#8208;&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;DGR] integrin ligand and the cytotoxic agent Paclitaxel (PTX), were synthesized to investigate the influence of a PEG&#8208;4 chain and of the sC18 cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) on the cellular uptake and the cytotoxicity of the constructs. A &#8220;double click&#8208;reaction strategy&#8221; was planned, to realize the connection of c&lt;i&gt;yclo&lt;/i&gt;[DKP&#8208;&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;DGR] and PTX to the CPP moiety. Anti&#8208;proliferative bioassays were performed on the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#946;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;positive U87 human glioblastoma cell line using a short contact time (15&#8197;min) followed by draining, washing of the cells, and re&#8208;incubation for 72&#8197;h. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; was significantly more potent (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=27.6&#8197;&#956;M) than compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;100&#8197;&#956;M), and showed a reduced potency loss with respect to PTX (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=71&#8197;nM).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Amination of Aryl Halides Mediated by Electrogenerated Nickel from Sacrificial Anode</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2462-2469, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp2)&#8722;N bond formation only mediated by nickel salts electrogenerated from the sacrificial anode has been investigated for the first time to prepare functionalized arylamine derivatives. The cross&#8208;couplings are performed under constant current electrolysis, in an undivided cell, and without additional ligand at room temperature.







Abstract
Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;N couplings mediated by nickel salts generated from the sacrificial anode has been described for the first time. In this approach, the sacrificial nickel anode is employed as the sole source of nickel and the process, operationally simple to set up, enables the preparation of functionalized arylamine derivatives with moderate to good yields, under mild reaction conditions and without additional ligand. A cooperative process between the two electrodes is involved in the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Organocatalytic Amination of Pyrazolones with Azodicarboxylates: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2362-2366, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric method for the amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones using azo compounds is described. The developed process exhibits a wide substrate scope and high efficiency in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74&#8211;96&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in the effectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Imino&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides by &#8220;Reactivity Switching&#8221; Methodology for in&#8197;situ Generated Glycoside Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2479-2484, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical C&#8208;glycoside formation was achieved by a &#8220;reactivity switching&#8221; methodology, which is an expansion of the traditional armed/disarmed concept. Logical reactivity design was enabled by considering electron density, pKa, and resulting anomeric leaving ability of acetate moiety of in&#8197;situ generated glycoside donors. Finally, we synthesized various imino&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides (C&#8208;azanucleosides).







Abstract
Redox&#8208;induced regioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H C&#8208;glycosidation for unactivated prolinols was achieved by controlling the anomeric reactivity of electrochemically generated iminium cations. A mechanistic study revealed that the intermediate was pooled as covalent azaribose or iminium cation species in&#8197;situ, and the electrophilicity of intermediates can be adjusted by changing coexisting acids. We found that the armed/disarmed analogy concept of traditional glycochemistry can be adapted to our C&#8208;glycosidation reaction. Finally, we invented a logical synthetic methodology, named &#8220;reactivity switching&#8221; concept, and synthesized a series of imino&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides (C&#8208;azanucleosides) based on this methodology.

         <title>Stopped&#8208;Flow 19F NMR Spectroscopic Analysis of a Protodeboronation Proceeding at the Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Scale</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2331-2342, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protodeboronation of a reactive boronate has been analyzed by stopped&#8208;flow 19F NMR spectroscopy. The study shows how the consideration of longitudinal relaxation, pre&#8208;magnetization, mixing, heat transfer, pulse angle, interscan delay, and spectral interleaving, allows the kinetics of a reaction with a half&#8208;life of 0.12&#8197;seconds to be measured by NMR.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopic analysis of homogeneous reactions is an essential tool for mechanistic analysis in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, rapid non&#8208;equilibrium reactions, that are initiated by mixing, require specialized approaches. We report herein on a study of the factors that ensure quantitative results in a recently&#8208;developed technique for stopped&#8208;flow NMR spectroscopy. The influence of some of the key parameters on quantitation is studied by 19F NMR spectroscopic analysis of the kinetics and activation parameters for the base&#8208;catalyzed protodeboronation of highly&#8208;reactive polyfluorinated arylboronic acids, with half&#8208;lives as low as 0.1&#8197;seconds. The effects of spin relaxation, pre&#8208;magnetization, heat&#8208;transfer versus reaction enthalpy, and mixing&#8208;efficiency are analyzed in detail. We also compare and contrast choice of pulse angle, interscan delay, and use of pseudo real&#8208;time by interleaving, as means to achieve an optimal balance between temporal resolution and sensitivity.

         <dc:description>
A conformer&#8208;dependent, quantitative quadrant descriptor has been developed. This descriptor can be used to generate regression models relating catalyst selectivity to catalyst stereostructure. This descriptor merges the heuristic value of the quadrant model with a quantitative tool to model catalyst stereoselectivity.

This study reports the development and application of a conformer&#8208;dependent quantitative quadrant descriptor for generating models that relate catalyst performance to catalyst structure in enantioselective transformations. The generality of these descriptors is demonstrated by using them for three different reactions: (1) copper&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective cyclopropanation of alkenes, (2) rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted N&#8208;acyl&#8208;enamides, and (3) enantioselective addition of thiols to N&#8208;acyl imines. This work will provide researchers an interpretable steric descriptor that merges the heuristic value of quadrant models with a quantitative tool that can be used to create statistically meaningful correlations between the steric occupancy of catalyst quadrants and stereoselectivity. The low dimensionality of this descriptor, its ability to capture conformational effects and stereostructure, and its direct relationship to intuitive structural properties make it particularly well&#8208;suited for creating Quantitative Structure&#8208;Selectivity Relationships (QSSR) with smaller datasets of asymmetric reactions.

         <title>New &#960;&#8208;Extended 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Ferrocenes with Thioate and Dithioate End Groups</title>

Several ferrocene&#8208;based extended &#960; systems with sulfur&#8208;containing end groups were prepared by Sonogashira coupling reactions and treatment of thioesters with Lawesson's reagent. Preliminary experiments towards the formation of gold complexes are included.







Abstract
Extended &#960; systems based on 1,1&#8242;&#8208;aryl or (2&#8208;arylethynyl) disubstitution at ferrocene with thioate or dithioate end groups are reported. In the context of molecular electronics, such end groups are possible alternative end groups for the attachment of molecular wires at gold surfaces. The respective thioates were successfully prepared in high yields via the respective carboxylic acid derivatives. Subsequent treatment with Lawesson's reagent led to the respective dithioates. However, this did not work in the presence of triple bonds, in these cases, product mixtures were formed. On the basis of literature evidence with Woollin's reagent, the selenium analog of Lawesson's reagent, one product was tentatively characterized as a double cyclization product of two triple bonds and two molecules of Lawesson's reagent. Preliminary experiments towards the formation of gold complexes by reaction with a Johnphos gold(I) salt are included.

         <title>Glyoxylic Acid: A Carboxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Reaction Toward Propargylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2448-2451, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile metal&#8208;free decarboxylative reaction of glyoxylic acid monohydrate with secondary amines and alkynes to produce propargylamines has been developed. In this reaction, the carboxyl group of glyoxylic acid can enhance the activation of the alkynes to react with iminium ion intermediate without any catalysts, thus increasing the sustainability of the process.







Abstract
Readily available propargylamines are not only fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis, but also possess many prominent biological activities. A highly efficient, concise and environmentally benign decarboxylative reaction of glyoxylic acid monohydrate with secondary amines and alkynes has been elaborated, and a variety of propargylamines are delivered in moderate to good yields under metal&#8208;free conditions. A mechanism involving a carboxyl group that assists the reactivity of alkynes, which makes the procedure of Michael addition proceeded smoothly, has been proposed.

         <title>Electrochemical Tandem Cyclization of Unsaturated Oximes with Diselenides: A General Approach to Seleno Isoxazolines Derivatives with Quaternary Carbon Center</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2431-2435, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical oxidative tandem cyclization of unsaturated oximes with diselenides has been developed to provide a general access to seleno isoxazolines (35 examples). This novel protocol features mild reaction conditions (metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free), good functional group tolerance (including ester, sulfone, heterocycles), and promising scalability. Moreover, two plausible reaction pathways have been proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry experiment.

A general and convenient approach has been developed to prepare 3&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;isochromanones by &lt;b&gt;copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H alkoxylation of&lt;/b&gt; 4&#8208;isochromanones with alcohols. The key features are easily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent regioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylated and 5&#8208;Alkenylated Chromones via Catalytic C&#8208;H Coupling of Chromones with Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2411-2420, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylated and 5&#8208;alkenylated chromones from readily accessible substrates using Rh(III) and Ru(II) catalysts has been successfully developed. Forty&#8208;one examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 95&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe two types of C5 functionalization reactions of chromones with allyl alcohols. Diverse 5&#8208;substituted chromones can be produced by modulating the catalysts in these reactions: Rh(III) results in the formation of 5&#8208;alkylated chromones, and Ru(II) furnishes 5&#8208;alkenylated products. We also achieve further functionalizations of these 5&#8208;substituted chromones, which demonstrates the superiority of this method. Notable features of these new methods include readily available precursors, tunable reactivity, exclusive C5&#8208;selectivity, and easy derivatization of products.

         <title>RGD Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugates as Effective Dual Targeting Platforms: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2506-2528, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent conjugation of a drug with an integrin&#8208;targeted RGD&#8208;peptide through non&#8208;cleavable or cleavable linkers creates new molecular entities recapitulating the strengths of the individual modules (e.&#8201;g. diseased cell affinity and selectivity, therapeutic potency), while possibly providing dual or synergistic action, as well as enhanced safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.







Abstract
In recent years, targeted therapies have raised increasing interest as effective strategies to improve therapeutic efficiency, reduce the impact of adverse side effects, and overcome drug resistance, particularly in the field of cancer chemotherapeutics. Many examples of RGD (Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp) peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) have been proposed as targeted drug delivery systems. These molecular hybrids embody high affinity ligands targeting disease signatures (overexpressed integrin receptors or specific integrin&#8208;related pathways within diseased cells/tissues) connected to recognized therapeutic units by means of carefully designed linker&#8208;spacer combinations, to ultimately control stability, physico&#8208;chemical properties, timing, and localization of drug release. This account has collected and critically surveyed relevant contributions from the period of 2015 to the present day, wishing to provide a window open on new synthesis strategies facing the challenging issues of site&#8208;selective drug delivery and dual drug targeting.

         <title>In Situ Preparation of Palladium Nanoparticles for C&#8208;2 Selective Arylation of Indoles in Agro&#8208;Waste Extract Based Mixed Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2470-2473, May 7, 2021. </description>

An in&#8197;situ generation of palladium nanoparticle catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation of indoles with iodoarenes for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindoles in bio&#8208;based mixed solvents is described.







Abstract
An efficient and practical method for the in&#8197;situ generation of palladium nanoparticles was successfully established in a water extract of pomelo peel ash. The produced palladium nanoparticles were characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy elemental mapping, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and showed high catalytic activity for selective C&#8208;2 arylation of indoles. A series of 2&#8208;arylindoles were smoothly installed in moderate to good yields through the direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of indoles and iodoarenes without external ligand, base, oxidant, and preinstallation directing group.

         <title>Synthesis and Spectrophotometric Studies of 9&#8208;Substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine Multifunctionalizable Fluorescent Dyes and Their Macrocyclic Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2485-2497, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of several new easy&#8208;to&#8208;functionalize acridine fluorophores as precursors of optochemical sensor molecules or dyes is reported. The possibilities for modifying position 9 of the proposed acridine intermediates are discussed. Studies on chemical stability and fluorescence signaling were carried out as a function of the 9&#8208;substituent. Photophysical characterization of the new dyes shows outstanding properties.







Abstract
Acridine derivatives are widely used as antiseptics, disinfectants, antibiotics, and fluorescent dyes as well as a subunit of optical sensor molecules of various analytical applications. We reported here the synthesis of several new 9&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine derivatives (9&#8208;bromo&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;benzyloxyphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;, 9&#8208;phenyltriazole&#8208;, 9&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]&#8208;, 9&#8208;nitrile&#8208;) as potential multifunctionalizable fluorescent precursors of sensor molecules, indicators or dyes including optimized procedures for preparation of 9&#8208;haloacridines and their cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Improved stability of several new compounds could be achieved by the synthetic modification at position 9 of the acridine unit compared to their unsubstituted acridine analogs. The basic spectroscopic characteristics of these useful intermediates were also determined. The new fluorescent compounds showed promising photochemical properties for optochemical&#8208;based applications in the future. The extremely large Stokes&#8208;shifts (above 15500&#8197;cm&#8722;1) should especially be emphasized. Moreover, the effects of the substituents at position 9 of the acridine unit on fluorescence signaling were studied by the examples of new precursors and their macrocyclic derivatives as known optical sensor molecules. Some interesting relationships between quantum yield and structural features were reported.

         <title>Visualisation of Chemical Shielding Tensors (VIST) to Elucidate Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2529-2539, May 7, 2021. </description>

A method for the visualisation of chemical shielding tensors (VIST) is developed, which provides a graphical representation of aromaticity and antiaromaticity, their local variations, and anisotropy. The method provides unique insight into fascinating phenomena such as the interplay of aromaticity and antiaromaticity in macrocycles with competing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Aromaticity is a central concept in chemistry, pervading areas from biochemistry to materials science. Recently, chemists also started to exploit intricate phenomena such as the interplay of local and global (anti)aromaticity or aromaticity in non&#8208;planar systems and three dimensions. These phenomena pose new challenges in terms of our fundamental understanding and the practical visualisation of aromaticity. To overcome these challenges, a method for the visualisation of chemical shielding tensors (VIST) is developed here that allows for a 3D visualisation with quantitative information about the local variations and anisotropy of the chemical shielding. After exemplifying the method in different planar hydrocarbons, we study two non&#8208;planar macrocycles to show the unique benefits of the VIST method for molecules with competing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and conclude with a norcorrole dimer showing clear evidence of through&#8208;space aromaticity. We believe that the VIST method will be a highly valuable addition to the computational toolbox.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of the Quinolizidine&#8208;Indolizidine Alkaloids of the Leontidine/Camoensine Family</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 17, Page 2498-2505, May 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetracyclic alkaloids of the leontidine/camoensine family, which all possess the rare natural quinolizidine&#8208;indolizidine skeleton, were prepared from the commercially available and abundant alkaloid cytisine. The key intermediate was N&#8208;Boc&#8208;11&#8208;oxocytisine, which can be converted in just a few steps into the natural products with an endo&#8208; or, optionally, exo&#8208;&#945;,N&#8208;fused pyrrolidine.







Abstract
Leontidine and camoensine, the main representatives of the small quinolizidine&#8208;indolizidine alkaloid subgroup, are characterized by an inner bispidine system to which a 2&#8208;pyridone and a pyrrolidine are fused on opposite sides. We efficiently synthesized both natural products from the commercially available and abundant alkaloid cytisine, which was converted into the key intermediate, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;11&#8208;oxocytisine, by iodine oxidation and protection. Grignard addition, Paal&#8208;Knorr type cyclization, and hydrogenation delivered endo&#8208;pyrrolidine fused leontidine, while the reversed reaction order, viz. reduction, Sakurai allylation, and ring closure, afforded exo&#8208;pyrrolidine annulated camoensine. Hydrogenation and deoxygenation of the pyridone moieties provided four further alkaloids, tetrahydroleontidine, camoensidine, 11&#8208;epileontidane and leontidane. In addition, the artificial alkaloid isoleontidine, carrying an endo&#8208;fused pyrrolidine on the same side as the pyridone, was prepared from C&#8208;13 oxidized cytisine.

         <title>Peptide Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Cyclization: A &#8220;Molecular Claw&#8221; Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion via the C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, as most current peptide syntheses use C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization.







Abstract
Both naturally occurring and artificial cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications due to the improvement of their enzymatic stability, cell permeability, and pharmacological activity compared to their linear counterparts. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, where linear peptides are cyclized via C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, since most current peptide synthesis has been dominated by the use of C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization. The use of an amide &#8220;N&#8208;tag&#8221; instead of the general terminal C&#8208;tag enables an effective head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization on&#8208;support. The key for successful cyclization is a tagging position that enables the center of the peptide to be grabbed.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of gem&#8208;Dibromovinyl BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY derivatives bearing gem&#8208;dibromovinyl moieties (&#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole rings, directly or through phenyl spacers) undergo efficiently Sonogashira and Stille Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling resulting in the formation of 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products. A pronounced red shift of absorption maxima occurs when substituents are at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;p&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.







Abstract
4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivatives bearing gem&#8208;dibromovinyl moieties at either the &#946;&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole rings, directly or through phenyl spacers, undergo efficiently Sonogashira and Stille Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. The structures of the resulting 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products were assigned using MS, NMR and in some cases X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. 1,1&#8208;Diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene BODIPYs exhibit red shifted absorption maxima, particularly when substituents were introduced at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents. Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;p&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.

Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;p&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivatives bearing &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dibromovinyl moieties at either the &#946;&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole rings, directly or through phenyl spacers, undergo efficiently Sonogashira and Stille Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. The structures of the resulting 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products were assigned using MS, NMR and in some cases X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. 1,1&#8208;Diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene BODIPYs exhibit red shifted absorption maxima, particularly when substituents were introduced at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents. Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this mini&#8208;review we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Addressing the target identification and accelerating the repositioning of anti&#8208;inflammatory/anti&#8208;cancer organic compounds by computational approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of computational chemistry techniques has led to notable advances in the structural and pharmacological investigation of organic compounds. The combination of quantum mechanical (QM) approaches with experimental methods (e.g., NMR spectroscopy) contributed to the configurational and conformational structural assignment of the investigated items. Once this information was obtained,  in silico  tools can be employed for assessing the pharmacological features of natural and synthetic molecules, especially those lacking precise information about their interacting macromolecules. With this aim, we developed and implemented the Inverse Virtual Screening (IVS) computational methodology for addressing the target identification task. This minireview focuses on the key technical information and on successful examples about the convenient and fast use of such computational methods in the frame of the drug repositioning and the discovery of anti&#8208;inflammatory/anti&#8208;cancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions by Intermolecular Cooperative Thiourea/Oxime Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of intermolecular cooperative thiourea/oxime hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis for improving and accelerating asymmetric aminocatalysis is presented. The two readily available hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating catalysts operates in synergy with a chiral amine catalyst to accomplish highly stereoselective transformations. The synergistic catalyst systems simultaneously activates both electrophiles, nucleophiles and makes the transformations more chemo&#8208; and stereoselective. This was exemplified by performing co&#8208;catalytic enantioselective direct intermolecular &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of aldehydes, direct aldol reactions, and asymmetric conjugate reactions, which gave the corresponding products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Functional Chromophores from Biomimetic o&#8208;Quinone Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise highlight of the main types of chromophoric systems obtained in the authors&#8217; and other laboratories  via  biomimetic chemistry or synthetic manipulation of nature&#8208;inspired  o  &#8208;quinones is the primary aim of this Minireview. Following oxidative conversion of a variety of natural catechol substrates like DOPA, dopamine, 5&#8208;  S  &#8208;cysteinyldopa and caffeic acid, in the presence of suitable additives, a remarkable variety of chromophoric systems can be produced, which display specific optical and electronic properties,  e.g.  acidichromism, solvatochromism or strong emission upon excitation. Such properties can be tailored for specific applications through rational synthetic manipulations and/or fine&#8208;tuning  via  non&#8208;covalent and supramolecular interactions. Practical access routes to the reported  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;derived chromophoric systems are illustrated along with the main prospective applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Selenodihydronaphthalenes by Selenoxide&#8208;mediated Electrophilic Cyclization of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, selenium mediated electrophilic cyclization reaction was realized through a one&#8208;pot procedure between simple alkynes and triflic anhydride&#8208;activated selenoxides to give selenium containing dihydronaphthalene products. This method gave good to very high yields for all products including selenium&#8208;substituted phenanthrene, dihydroquinoline, 2H  &#8208;chromene, and coumarin, which can be further transformed to other functionalized compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophore Multimerization as an Efficient Approach towards Bright Protein Labels</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increase of the number of fluorophores per protein label (F/P) leads to increase of the brightness, however at relatively low F/P ratios. Beyond a certain F/P ratio, brightness starts to drop due to significant fluorophore self&#8208;quenching. To tackle this issue, novel approaches for multimerization of fluorescent&#8197;dyes have been developed, which are summarized in this Minireview.







Abstract
Cell analysis techniques like flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are widely used to explore cells in real&#8208;time and provide important insights into a variety of cellular processes. These techniques require bright and specific staining reagents to generate strong fluorescence signal and enable reliable read&#8208;out, making the choice of fluorescent labels a key aspect of experimental design. Much research has been done in the field of fluorophore development to generate bright small&#8208;molecule&#8197;dyes, fluorescent proteins, and emitting nanoparticles. However, it remains challenging to modify biomolecules with multiple emitters and avoid self&#8208;quenching of such fluorophores at the same time. Herein, we present advances in multimerization&#8208;based methods for the generation of fluorescent labels with high brightness and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy applications.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Mustard carbonate analogues as sustainable reagents for the aminoalkylation of phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,N  &#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moiety can be found in numerous scaffolds of macromolecules, catalysts and especially pharmaceuticals. Common synthetic procedures for its the incorporation in a substrate relies on the use of a nitrogen mustard gas or on multistep syntheses featuring chlorine hazardous/toxic chemistry. Herein is reported a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of aminoalkyl chain via dialkyl carbonate (&#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate) chemistry into different phenolic substrates. This new direct alcohol substitution procedure avoids the use of chlorine chemistry, is efficient on numerous pharmacophore scaffolds with good to quantitative yield. The cytotoxicity via MTT of the &#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate, key intermediate of this synthetic approach, was also evaluated and compared with its alcohol precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular (Hetero)Michael Additions in Desymmetrization Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrization reaction by means of an intramolecular (hetero)Michael addition is a useful strategy for the creation of complex polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with the generation of multiple stereocenters in a very simple manner. The intramolecular addition of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles of prochiral substrates bearing electronically deficient olefins takes place in the presence of organocatalysts, such as chiral primary and secondary amines, NHCs, ureas, thioureas and BINOL phosphoric acid derivatives reaching high levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The most important bottleneck of this methodology is the design and synthesis of the starting materials, which compromises its application. To date, the majority of the examples are related to the use of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedione derivatives</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of glycosyl donor phenyl 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside with NIS/TfOH(cat.) was systematically studied under various reaction conditions. Neither the molecular sieve pore size nor amount of NIS activator was found to have an effect on the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;ratio in reaction with L&#8208;menthol as glycosyl acceptor. Increasing concentration and the amount of triflic acid catalyst, however was found to increase the &#946;&#8208;selectivity in certain cases. Also, lowering temperature was found to have a strong effect on the glycosylation outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free sp3&#8208;sp3 Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling Between Benzylboronic Esters and Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free coupling reaction of benzylboronic esters and alkyl halides has been developed. Both alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were found to be competent substrates with the nucleophilic boronate intermediate generated from the combination of benzylboronic ester and an alkyllithium. Good chemoselectivity was observed for the reaction with the alkyl bromide in substrates with a second electrophile present. Both secondary and tertiary benzylboronic esters were effective nucleophiles in the reaction with primary alkyl halides. Mechanistic observations are consistent with a radical mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A structure&#8208;activity investigation on modified analogues of an argininocalixarene based non&#8208;viral gene vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene  1  has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different type of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by a rather weak toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Buckyball as an Electron Donor in a Dyad of C60 and Xanthene Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully achieved the synthesis of C  60  &#8211;xanthlium,  X60_NTf  2  , where fullerene is an  electron donor  and xanthlium is an  electron acceptor  . When the precursor compound  X60&#8208;OH  was excited at 550 nm, the C  60  emission was observed at 715 nm. On the other hand, the fluorescence of  X60_NTf  2  was completely quenched under the same conditions, suggesting that photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer (ET) occurred from the singlet excited state of C  60  . The electrochemical measurement proved that the  X60_NTf  2  is exothermically possible of ET reaction from  1  C  60  * to xanthylium to form C  60  &#65381;+  . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the acceptor ability of the xanthylium by showing that the coefficients of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were on xanthene moiety. This is a well&#8208;arranged model compound to investigate the properties of transiently generated fullerene radical cations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ugly Duckling Metamorphosis: The Ammonia/Formaldehyde Couple Made Possible in Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ugi reactions are still a challenge when the concomitant use of ammonia and formaldehyde is required. Herein, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as a singular key for the employment of these two simple starting materials in the Ugi reaction. Acylaminoacetamide derivatives were prepared in good to excellent yields by this new methodology. The scope and optimization of the reaction conditions were investigated. This novel methodology was successfully applied in the synthesis of two different diketopiperazines (DKPs) using the Ugi/ Deprotection+Activation/Cyclization (UDAC) method. A continuous flow approach was also used in this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>[Zinc(II)(Pyridine&#8208;Containing Ligand)] Complexes as Single&#8208;Component Efficient Catalyst for Chemical Fixation of CO2 with Epoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between epoxides and CO  2  to yield cyclic carbonates is efficiently promoted under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions (0.5 mol% catalyst loading, 0.8 MPa, 125 &#176;C) by zinc(II) complexes of pyridine containing macrocyclic ligands (Pc&#8208;L pyridinophanes).

The combination of equimolecular catalytic amounts of DABCO and acetic acid proved highly efficient, and tolerates well a wide range of Michael acceptors and substituted 6&#8208;membered ring sulfamidate imines, as well as a sultam derivative.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Diformylated N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene Hexamers by Macrocyclization with Aromatic Diamines</title>

Stapling and sorting: Terminal ortho&#8208;substitution and macrocyclization by imine formation/exchange stapled and sorted dynamic helical N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene units. The structure responded to acids in the reaction mixture.







Abstract
Abstract: Diformylated N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamers (4&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b) were prepared from 2,3&#8208;dichloropyrydine by palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions and deprotection. Three helical conformers of 4, corresponding to the rotations of the terminal phenylenes, were observed in 1H&#8208;NMR spectra of solution state. Chiral self&#8208;sorting of 4&#8201;a occurred by macrocyclization with para&#8208;phenylenediamine in the presence of para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The homochiral structure (PP and MM) containing two N&#8208;hetero&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene hexamer (N&#8208;oP6) moieties was revealed by 1H&#8208;NMR and mass spectra, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Using (+)&#8208; or (&#8722;)&#8208;camphorsulfonic acid was also effective in the formation of the homochiral macrocycle and also induced a chiral bias in the helical folding of N&#8208;oP6 moieties. Moreover, planar chiral self&#8208;sorting of the bridged moieties was also achieved by using 4&#8201;a and 1,5&#8208;diaminonaphthalene.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Methyl 2&#8208;Oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18 &#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylating disulfides and thiols with hydrosilicones catalyzed by B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrosilanes and silicones, catalyzed with B(C6F5)3, may be used to silylate thiols or cleave disulfides giving silyl thio ethers. Alcohols were found to react faster than thiols or disulfides, while alkoxysilanes (the Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction) were slower such that the overall order of reactivity was found to be HO &gt; HS &gt; SS &gt; SiOEt. The resulting silane and silicone&#8208;protected thio ethers produced from the sulfur&#8208;based functional groups could be cleaved to thiols using alcohols or mild acid with rates that depend on the steric bulk of the siloxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation for the synthesis of borylated indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reactions were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorene derivatives bearing two to seven phthalimidomethyl groups: Syntheses, crystal structures and conversion to amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene derivatives containing four to seven phthalimidomethyl groups (1,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;isoindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl groups) were prepared from 9  H  &#8208;fluorene, 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorene as well as from 2,7&#8208; and 2,4,7&#8208;functionalized 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorenes by using the conditions of the  Tscherniac&#8208;Einhorn  reaction. By reacting the 9,9&#8208;diethyl substituted fluorenes with  N  &#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phthalimide the 2,4,6,7&#8208; and 2,3,4,6,7&#8208;substituted derivatives were obtained. In the absence of the ethyl groups, as in the case of 9  H  &#8208;fluorene, the formation of the sixfold and sevenfold substituted compounds was observed (1,2,3,5,7,8&#8208; and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;substituted fluorenes). It should be noted that one position in the bay region of the fluorene skeleton (position 4 or 5) remains unsubstituted in each of the prepared four&#8208; to sevenfold substituted 9  H  &#8208;fluorenes. The conversion of the phthalimidomethyl substituted 9,9&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9  H  &#8208;fluorenes into the corresponding amines takes place with excellent yields. The solid state structures of the compounds bearing phthalimidomethyl groups were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The manuscript provides information about the synthetic routes to new fluorene derivatives and their molecular structures as well as the patterns of noncovalent interactions in the crystalline state.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Optimized synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers and their assembly into PNA oligomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous advancement of application of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers encouraged exploration of rapid and efficient synthesis of PNA monomers and oligomers. Among the PNA monomers developed, only a few are commonly used in automated PNA synthesis. Here, we report short and efficient protocols suitable for large&#8208;scale synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers with advantageous solubility properties; these also facilitate purification due to the traceless nature of the Boc protecting group. Initially, several coupling reagents were screened for assembly of a pentamer containing all four nucleobases, and then the most promising reagents were tested in the synthesis of a decamer. The Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected monomers proved compatible with both manual synthesis and assembly on an automated peptide synthesizer at room temperature or at 40&#176;C. As compared to the commonly used coupling agent &#160;(1&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridinium 3&#8208;oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU) both 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and [ethyl cyano(hydroxyimino)acetato&#8208;O  2  ]tri&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinylphosphonium hexa&#8208;fluorophosphate (PyOxim) proved more favorable, with the latter being superior. A previously reported side reaction of guanine bases in the presence of benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) was not observed with the phosphonium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>An overview of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from cycloaddition reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important scaffolds in several fields, and there is still a demand to construct these compounds, most notably the disubstituted 4, 5 compounds. The latter are obtained in different ways, but the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;halo triazoles are generally the key intermediates in their synthesis. These halogenated compounds are an extraordinary platform to lead to a very great chemical diversity around the 4 and 5 positions. However, their own pathways are generally put aside at the expense of the substituted triazoles. This review is focused on the main synthesis of 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;halo 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from cycloaddition followed or not of halogenation reaction. Unlike the halogens (iodine, bromine and chlorine), the 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;fluoro 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles will be presented separately due to their relatively more difficult and still recently challenging synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of azasugar&#8208;sulfonamide conjugates and their evaluation as inhibitors of Carbonic Anhydrases: the azasugar approach to selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs; EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc metalloenzymes which play a pivotal role both in physiological and pathological processes in humans (h). Therefore, modulation of the activity of hCAs represents an appealing target for drug development, which results highly challenging due to the large number of isozymes expressed and requires the discovery of selective inhibitors. By following the &#8220;sugar approach&#8221; and in light of our recent disclosure of two selective hCAs inhibitors based on nitrogen containing glycomimetic&#8208;sulfonamide conjugates, twelve new azasugar&#8208;benzenesulfonamides have been synthesized. These compounds were prepared by connecting several benzenesulfonamides to a triazole armed azasugar, varying the length of chain and type of linking moiety (ureido, amido or thioureido) to probe their influence on the inhibition profile. The  in vitro  biological assays highlighted that such structural changes have remarkable effects on the hCAs inhibition profile. Several new compounds behave as selective inhibitors, and four of them are particularly effective on the therapeutically relevant hCAs II and VII isoforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects Despite Evidence for Catalyst Aggregation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One might think that the absence of a non&#8208;linear effect (NLE) might necessarily mean that only monomeric complexes catalyze a studied enantioselective reaction. Herein, a counter&#8208;example using an ephedrine&#8208;derived ligand in asymmetric alkylzinc additions is shown. The system is catalyzed by both monomers and dimers, although no NLE is apparent.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt2 to benzaldehyde with (1R,2S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs. catalyst loading and NMR investigations (1H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs. ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the absence of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model, which we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs. ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.

         <title>The effect of TCNE and TCNQ Acceptor Units on Triphenylamine&#8208;Naphthalenediimide Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetrical and symmetrical push&#8208;pull chromophore&#8208;based on triphenylamine (TPA) donors and naphthalenediimide (NDI) acceptors are designed and successfully synthesized via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction with well&#8208;known electron accepting tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8,&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) groups. The novel series of compounds NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;6 were characterized to identify the influence of the TCNE and TCNQ &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers on the optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of these molecules. We found that in dichloromethane the NDI&#8208;TPAs 1, 4, 5, and 6 display absorbance peaks at increasing wavelengths 605, 641, 646 and 645 nm, respectively. We demonstrated that through simple chemical modification we could drop the lowest occupied molecular orbital of NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to 6. Furthermore, NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to 6 were integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) via spin&#8208;coating technique and charge transfer properties were investigated. We found that the choice of functional group led to either p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type or ambipolar characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I) Complexes of P&#8208;Stereogenic Josiphos and Related Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from (  R  )&#8208;Ugi&#8217;s amine, diastereoselective lithiation followed by Ar&#8217;PCl  2  and then Ar&#8217;&#8217;MgBr led to the generation, as single diastereoisomers, of (  R  ,  S  p  ,  S  phos  ) [Ar&#8217; = Ph, Ar&#8217;&#8217; =  o  &#8208;Tol] and (  R  ,  S  p  ,  R  phos  ) [Ar&#8217; =  o  &#8208;Tol, Ar&#8217;&#8217; = Ph] PPFA ligand derivatives. Amine substitution of both with HPCy  2  gave  P  &#8208;stereogenic Josiphos ligands, and then addition of CuCl, the corresponding copper(I) complexes. The latter were also generated by use of borane P and N protecting groups and  in situ  Cu(I) complexation, avoiding the isolation of air&#8208;sensitive phosphine intermediates. This protection methodology was also applied to the synthesis of Josiphos/CuCl complexes derived from PCl  3  . In addition, related bulky cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex based derivatives were also obtained. Preliminary investigation revealed isolated CuCl complexes as competent catalyst precursors for enantioselective conjugate addition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic strategies towards imidazopyridinones and 7&#8208;azaoxindoles and their evaluation as antibacterial agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazopyridinones and 7&#8208;azaoxindoles are two classes of heterocyclic compounds with only limited previous use in organic and medicinal chemistry. Various synthetic methods and routes have been evaluated to identify safe and robust chemistry to advanced imidazopyridinone building blocks and inhibitor structures. Preparation of the 7&#8208;azaoxindoles was challenged by instability of the core scaffold. Key to the successful isolation of the target structure was development of a mild Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling in non&#8208;aqueous media. The imidazopyridinones were potent inhibitors of the  E. coli  thymidylate monophosphate kinase, while the&#160; 7&#8208;azaoxindole showed low activity. The compounds were inactive in cell&#8208;based studies, indicating poor cell wall penetration.</dc:description>

         <title>A Kinetic Photometric Assay for the Quantification of the Open&#8208;Chain Content of Aldoses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple UV&#8208;based kinetic assay allows the accurate determination of the minute proportions (&lt;1&#8201;%) of the open&#8208;chain forms (OCC) of aldoses in equilibrium with the dominant ring forms. The OCC&#8208;data of all parent aldoses has been determined with this new ABAO&#8208;assay and is fully consistent with the literature gold standard, allowing extension into first practical synthetic challenges.







Abstract
Aldoses exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form, which is in equilibrium with the open&#8208;chain aldehyde form. The small aldehyde content hampers reactivity when chemistry addresses the carbonyl moiety. This low concentration of the available aldehyde is generally difficult to ascertain. Herein, we demonstrate a new kinetic determination of the (minute) open&#8208;chain content (OCC) of aldoses. This kinetic approach exploits the aldehyde&#8208;selectivity of 2&#8208;aminobenzamidoxime (ABAO), which furnishes a strongly UV&#8208;active adduct. Simple formation curves can be measured in a photometer or plate reader for high&#8208;throughput screening. Under pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics, these curves correlate with a prediction model yielding the relative OCC. The OCCs of all parent aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) were determined referencing against the two tetroses with exceptionally high OCCs and were in very good agreement with literature data. Additionally, the assay was extended towards higher&#8208;carbon sugars with unknown OCC and also applied to rationalise a lack of reactivity observed in a recent synthetic investigation.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Recent advances in organic synthesis using light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. Elseways, the use of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as organocatalyst emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity via the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. Elseways, the use of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as organocatalyst emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity via the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling for the Efficient Preparation of Symmetric Diarylalkyne Ligands for Metal&#8208;Organic Cages**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type synthesis is reported that enables the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages in high isolated yields and short reaction times.







Abstract
The often time&#8208;consuming and challenging multi&#8208;step synthesis of ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages is a limiting factor for the discovery and application of new cages. We report a highly efficient copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling for the preparation of symmetric diarylalkyne ligands on both a small and large scale; bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for the self&#8208;assembly of Co4L6 cages were synthesized in short reaction times and high isolated yields directly from aryl halide precursors. This one&#8208;pot method reduces the synthetic burden of ligand synthesis and will facilitate the preparation of ligands with additional functionality for applications of their corresponding cages.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic Near&#8208;Infrared luminophores have found broad application as functional materials, but the development of efficient NIR emitters is still a challenging goal. Here we report on a new class of thieno[3,4&#8208;  b  ]pyrazine&#8208;based NIR emitting materials with Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The dyes feature a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure, with a thienopyrazine acceptor core connected to two triarylamine donor groups bearing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety. Fast and efficient synthesis allowed the modular preparation of three dyes of tunable absorption and emission profiles. These constructs were extensively characterized by spectroscopic studies in different solvents, which revealed intense light&#8208;harvesting ability and emissions in the deep&#8208;red and NIR region with large Stokes shift values. Remarkably, the dyes exhibited AIE properties, retaining emissive ability in the aggregate state, thus emerging as attractive materials for their potential application in the development of luminescent devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions between Stacked Arenes in 1,8&#8208;Bis&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes have been prepared with a combination of electron&#8208;rich and electron poor in the two 1&#8208;naphthyl rings. The conformational analysis by NMR and ECD spectroscopy, aided by DFT calculations, showed that the atropisomers ratio and the conformational preferences within each atropisomer are mainly due to the Coulombic interactions between the two facing rings.







Abstract
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes, bearing different substituents in the 1&#8208;naphthyl moieties have been prepared to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the stacked arenes. The best geometries were determined by means of DFT calculations, and experimentally checked by NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). High temperature NMR spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the balance between dispersive and electrostatic contributions (ratio between two diastereomeric syn/anti isomers of compounds 1&#8211;6), while ECD analysis of the syn isomers of compounds 3&#8211;5 allowed for a deeper insight on the electrostatic contributions that drive the geometry between the interacting rings. The two rings preferentially adopt a parallel displaced geometry, whose interaction energy is strongly influenced by the electrostatic features of the two naphthyl rings, and that dispersive forces play a very minor role.

COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Synthesis, cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal evaluation of ent&#8208;beyerene and ent&#8208;kaurene derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease endemic of tropical and subtropical countries. Current pharmacologic treatments have serious drawbacks. For these reasons, we need new and improved medical treatments. On the other side, natural products have been a valuable source of bioactive molecules, but unlike other products of natural origin, diterpenoids are molecules with only a few studies as antiparasitic drugs. Continuing our work on syntheses of beyerenes, and focusing on obtaining more compounds with antiparasitic activity, we describe in this work the syntheses and activity of several  ent  &#8208;beyerene and  ent  &#8208;kaurene type of compounds against CL, and also their toxicity. Utilizing classical reactions such as Grignard, Mitsunobu and Williamson, among others, it was possible to modify rings A and D of  ent  &#8208;beyerenes, specifically C&#8208;19 on ring A, and C&#8208;15 and C&#8208;16 on ring D. A total of 40 new compounds were obtained, 21 of them being active against  Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis  with median effective concentration (EC  50  ) values less than 25.0 mg/mL and of these with EC  50  values ranging from 1.8 to 7.1 mg/mL and Selectivity Index (SI) varying from 1.1 to 5.1. All compounds showed to be highly cytotoxic at concentrations less than 100 mg/mL, except compound  37  that was cytotoxic at 279.7 mg/mL and moderately active against  L. braziliensis  (EC  50  = 33.5 mg/mL and an SI of 8.4. All active compounds were  ent  &#8208;beyerene type.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Heterabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl Trifluoroborates</title>

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
