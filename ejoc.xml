         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore&#8217;s core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Ynenamides through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysis is a useful tool for C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. Of special interest is the hydroalkynylation reaction of alkynes, which provides a simple method for the synthesis of enamides representing interesting structural motifs in organic chemistry. So far, there are only a few examples of gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions. Herein, we were able to show by experiment that the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of ynamides leads regio&#8208; and stereoselectively to the corresponding ynenamides, a rather unknown type of molecule. A wide range of products could be generated with yields up to 80% and, in contrast to many other gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne dimerization reactions, alkyl groups are tolerated. Quantum chemical calculations and NMR labelling experiments reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of a Bioactive Lignanamide Using a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type Cyclization of Activated Cyclopropylcarbinols and Synthetic Support for the Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide was achieved with high enantiomeric excess. Key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;  endo&#8208;tet  &#8208;type cyclization that proceeds with a very high degree of stereoinduction. The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. &#160; Based on these &#160; experimental results, the&#160;  5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet  &#8208;type cyclization&#160;of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an S  N  1 mechanism with high&#160;  trans  &#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation&#160;of (i) the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an S  N  2 mechanism and/or (ii) a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an S  N  1&#8208;like mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Linker&#8208;Armed Trisaccharide Repeating Unit of the O&#8208;Antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA residues. The desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group.







Abstract
The manuscript reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy with rational protecting group manipulations. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA and the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc residues. The introduction of the desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group on the protected trisaccharide. 1,2&#8208;cis aminoethyl glycoside with central glucosamine is used at the reducing end to the leave the scope for further glycoconjugate formation with suitable aglycone without hampering the anomeric stereochemistry.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

Condensation with 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde provides easy access to a protected phosphoramidite building block of (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol, used as the backbone scaffold in the synthesis of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane nucleic acids (MOANAs). The resulting N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane moiety is stable under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis but readily hydrolyzed afterwards. Stability of the protection can be adjusted predictably by changing the substituent on the phenyl ring.







Abstract
Dependence of the hydrolysis rate of a series of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinanes on the Hammett substituent constant of the substituent of the phenyl ring was determined, yielding a reaction constant &#961;=&#8722;1.40&#177;0.05. Based on this information, 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde was selected as a protecting group for a new (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol phosphoramidite building block. The yield of the preparation of this building block as well as its coupling in automated oligonucleotide synthesis were greatly improved compared to the method reported previously. The 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazine protection persisted throughout the synthesis of short oligonucleotides but was rapidly removed when the oligonucleotides were released from solid support and dissolved in water.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of helicenes would yield interesting physical properties&#160;derived from the enhanced &#960;&#8208;stacking ability as well as intrinsic helical chirality. Here we report the regiodivergent synthesis of hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based [6]helicenes via the cationic rhodium(I)/segphos complex&#8208;mediated intramolecular [2+2+2] and [2+1+2+1] cycloadditions of triynes followed by the Scholl reaction. The resulting HBC&#8208;based [6]helicenes possess stable helical chirality but more planar structure than previously reported HBC&#8208;based [7] and [9]helicenes. Therefore, these HBC&#8208;based [6]helicenes exhibit &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;recognition in solution, allowing the measurement of enantiomeric ratios by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy without any chiral additive.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient method for access 2&#8208;(2&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl ketone) substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolinones was described. 2&#8208;Carboxyl allylic alcohols, which were readily available from the Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman adducts, were used as the synthons. &#160;The reaction of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinones and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylene&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpentanoic acid catalyzed by [RhCp*Cl  2  ]  2  &#8208;CF  3  COOAg  via  C&#8208;H activation and underwent facile decarboxylation to give the corresponding 2&#8208;(2&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl ketone) substituted 2&#8208;phenyl quinazolinones in good to excellent yields with a wide range of substrates tolerated and good group compatibility. The results of control experiments indicated that the nitrogen atom on 3&#8208;position of quinazolinone skeleton may function as the directing group in this C&#8208;H activation/functionalization.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Stable Nucleobase Protection for a Strongly Pairing Pyridone C&#8208;Nucleoside Suitable for Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotides are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutic applications and molecular biology. The low base pairing strength of thymine with adenine complicates their use. Ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside are analogs of thymidine that pair more strongly and with improved base selectivity, and sequences containing these analogs show improved target affinity and selectivity, but their routine use is hampered by diminished yields of solid&#8208;phase syntheses with the known building blocks. A partial loss of base protecting groups during the acidic deblocking step of chain extension cycles was identified as the cause of lower yields. Here we report the synthesis of an improved phosphoramidite building block featuring a pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) base protecting group. This building block gives oligonucleotides containing the strongly pairing ethynylmethylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside in high yield and purity via solid phase synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mannich Reaction: An Alternative Synthetic Approach for Various Pyrrole&#8208;Based Anion Receptors and Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article highlights the synthetic design of various pyrrole&#8208;based acyclic, tripodal macrocyclic, and macrobicyclic Mannich bases and their applications, mainly as anion receptors. By varying the amine&#8208;types and molar proportions of reagents, a range of value&#8208;added Mannich bases are obtained. Herein, the synthesis and properties of several azacalixpyrroles, azacalixdipyrrolylmethanes, and azacryptands are discussed. Emphasis is also given to the applications of pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases in the construction of some chelating ligands as one of the steps in multistep organic syntheses. In addition, the use of Mannich products as ligands for synthesizing metal complexes is also described. More importantly, the establishment of Mannich reactions as an alternative approach for traditionally used Schiff&#8217;s base or aldehyde/ketone&#8208;condensation reactions is delineated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategy towards a Carbocyclic N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the study of glycosidases, a class of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs), that are carbocyclic mimics of natural carbohydrates and can covalently bind the enzyme, have proven to be useful tools. This type of ABP has however not yet been reported for sialidases, glycosidases involved in various important biological processes in both health and disease, which hydrolyse terminal sialic acids. Here we present our study towards the synthesis of a carbocyclic sialic acid suitable for conversion into ABPs. We developed a route starting from a chiral furanone that includes a key early stage nitrone [3+2] cycloaddition to install most of the chiral centres present in N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid. The final stereocentre is installed via a Barbier alkylation, after which a ring closing metathesis forms the pivotal carbocyclic intermediate. Due to challenges in the final stretch, we were not able to convert this intermediate into an N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid ABP. However, the work presented here still represents a versatile route to potential future carbocyclic sialic acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diazo Compounds Employing NaN3 and Inexpensive SO2F2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and efficient method was developed in which sodium azide (NaN  3  ) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO  2  F  2  ) were directly employed to synthesize diazo compounds with active methylene compounds.  A variety of diazo compounds were produced in good to excellent yields. This protocol avoids the use of organosulfonyl azides, and features atom economy and mild reaction conditions. An alternate method for the synthesis of diazo compounds was provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hexaazatruxenes by Consecutive N&#8211;H/C&#8211;H Coupling Using a Hypervalent Iodine Reagent and Evaluation of Their Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Truxene is a  C  3&#160;&#160;  symmetric compound with characteristic photophysical properties, and it has great potential as a light&#8208;emitting material and building block. In this study, we demonstrate the facile synthesis of hexaazatruxenes using a two&#8208;step protocol. First, the hexaazatruxenes precursors were prepared through the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination of 1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene with commercially available or easily prepared amino&#8208;pyridine derivatives. Then, hexaazatruxenes were synthesized through consecutive N&#8211;H/C&#8211;H coupling using a hypervalent iodine reagent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of truxenes containing more than three heteroatoms in the main skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical reagents and methodologies (tools) employed for accurately and precisely programming over time the pH of a water solution are described in detail. For each tool, a number of selected examples is reported in order to show its feasibility and usefulness







Abstract

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Chlorodifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes by a Hypervalent Iodine EDA Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex enabling direct chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes is described. This method provides the privileged moiety with mild conditions across a broad range of functional groups and bioactive scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions and key control experiments are reported as well. The core EDA complex is studied spectroscopically, enabling further synthetic applications in the future.







Abstract
A novel EDA complex comprised of a bis(chlorodifluoroacetoxy)iodoarene and 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene is described, which enables the direct radical C(sp2)&#8722;H chlorodifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes under monochromatic visible&#8208;light irradiation. The procedure is mild, operationally simple, and utilizes commercially available reagents. The developed conditions demonstrate compatibility with a host of commonly encountered functionalities and biologically relevant scaffolds, whilst showcasing the post&#8208;functionalization capabilities of the &#8722;CF2Cl moiety. Various mechanistic studies were performed to explore the EDA complex and radical generation pathway.

         <title>Humins&#8208;Like Solid Support for Palladium Immobilization: Highly Efficient and Recyclable Catalyst for Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, we demonstrate the preparation of a novel bio&#8208;based polymeric material derived of 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) and maleic anhydride and its use as a solid support for metal immobilization, followed by its application as a reusable catalyst in cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
In the present work, a new humins&#8208;like resin was prepared using 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) and maleic anhydride in 2&#8197;min at 110&#8201;&#176;C. Such a new material was used as a solid support for palladium immobilization. For metal anchoring, encapsulation was the method of choice and palladium was encapsulated by in&#8208;situ polymerization. This resulting Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was characterized by solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR, FT&#8208;IR, SEM, TGA, DSC, XRD, and XPS. To demonstrate proof of concept, Heck and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to evaluate the activity and reusability of the catalyst. Green solvents such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), CyreneTM and ethylene carbonate proved to be excellent reaction media for Heck coupling, whereas EtOH/H2O was preferred for Suzuki coupling. Yields of up to 99&#8201;% were obtained in both cases. The recyclability of the Pd@DHMF&#8208;based catalyst was also demonstrated, 7&#8197;cycles have been achieved without loss of catalytic activity in both Heck and Suzuki reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that the Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction enables rapid deprotection of aryl alkyl ethers under ambient conditions. This chemistry leverages tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and silyl hydrides to convert aryl methyl ethers to siloxanes, which can then be cleaved using 1% HCl in EtOH. We examined 26 derivatives and routinely obtained yields &gt;85%, even in the presence of sterically demanding groups and complex substrate structures. Other alkyl ethers including ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert&#8208;butyl, and benzyl groups were also easily removed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recent Progress for the Synthesis of Thiocarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocarboxylates show unique physiological activity in biology and drugs, which inspires the exploration of many new therapeutic drugs. Here, we summarized a series of methods for the efficient synthesis of thioesters (thiocarboxylates).







Abstract
As a common and integral feature of many natural products, thiocarboxylates play an important role in biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds. Thiocarboxylates often show unique physiological activities in biology and drugs, which inspires many new therapeutic drugs. The related research and developments in thioester&#8208;based medicinal chemistry have been a rapidly developing and increasingly active topic in the last two decades. In this review, we will summarize the main methods for the synthesis of thiocarboxylates, which might provide general ideas to access more effective thioester&#8208;based drugs.

The reaction was carried out at room temperature using rose bengal as an organic photoredox catalyst and blue LED as a light source. It was observed that quinones underwent spiroannulation reaction with&#160;vinyl azide on C&#8208;O double bond instead of C&#8208;C double bond through which various corresponding&#160;various corresponding 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;spirooxazolines have been synthesized in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>H&#8208;Bonded Counterion&#8208;Directed Catalysis: Enantioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition to 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones as a Case Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96% yield, 62:38 to 95:5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.</dc:description>

         <title>Hammett Correlation in Competing Fragmentations of Ionized 2&#8208;Substituted Benzanilides Generated by Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good Hammett correlations with &#961; values varying between 0.69 and 0.38 and R2 values in the range 0.84&#8211;0.96 have been devised between the intensity of the ions formed by simple cleavage and rearrangement of four series of ionized 2&#8208;substituted benzanilides of general structure XC6H4NHCOC6H4Y [X=CH3O, Cl, Br or I; Y=H, F, Cl, Br, I, CH3, OCH3, CF3 or NO2]







Abstract
A good Hammett correlation has been found between the two principal fragmentations of four series of radical&#8208;cations generated by electron ionization of 2&#8208;substituted benzanilides of general structure XC6H4NHCOC6H4Y [X=CH3O, Cl, Br or I; Y=H, F, Cl, Br, I, CH3, OCH3, CF3 or NO2 in the 3 or 4 position]. When X is electron&#8208;donating, with a negative substituent constant, &#963;, simple cleavage of these ionic species to form a substituted benzoyl cation, [YC6H4CO]+, is favoured. In contrast, when Y is electron withdrawing, with a positive &#963; constant, rearrangement leading to elimination of X&#8901; by a proximity effect to form a protonated 2&#8208;arylbenzoxazole competes more effectively. Reproducible trends are observed in the derived reaction constant, &#961;, which declines on progressing from X=CH3O through Cl and Br to I. These trends establish that the mechanism of the proximity effect involves donation of electron density from the C6H4Y ring and is not materially altered by varying X.

         <title>Dual Metallaphotoredox Catalyzed Directed C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization: Access to C&#8208;C/C&#8208;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes, viz; metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site&#8208;selective C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8208;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8211;Halogen Bonds: Electrostatics&#8208;Controlled Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of&#160;C(spn)&#8211;X&#160;bonds (n = 1&#8211;3; X = F, Cl, Br, I) in the archetypal model substrates H3C&#8211;CH2&#8211;X, H2C=CH&#8211;X, and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X by a model bare palladium catalyst, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The bond activation reaction barrier decreases, for all&#160;sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centers, when the substituent X of the substrate is changed from X = F to I. Activation strain and energy decomposition analyses reveal that the enhanced reactivity along this series originates from (i) a less destabilizing activation strain due to an intrinsically weaker&#160;C(spn)&#8211;X&#160;bond; and (ii) an increasingly more stabilizing electrostatic interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. The latter is a direct consequence of the more diffuse electron density and higher nuclear charge of the X atom in the&#160;C(spn)&#8211;X bond when going from X = F to I, which, in turn, engages in a more favorable electrostatic attraction with the nucleus and electrons, respectively, of the palladium catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiiranes, the corresponding sulfur analogues of epoxides, are less studied and less encountered in literature. This might be due to the limited existing synthetic approaches for their synthesis. Herein, a mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized. Both aromatic and aliphatic moieties are well tolerated, leading to thiiranes in moderate to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have found diverse applications in multiple disciplines due to their reactivity and stability. Thus, exploiting the new reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides is of high importance to Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry. Reported herein is a three&#8208;component reaction of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, arynes and DMF for the streamline synthesis of sulfocoumarins. The reaction proceeds via the trapping of in situ generated o&#8208;quinone methides with &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, followed by selective cyclization with sulfonyl fluoride functionality. This strategy provides a new method to access diverse sulfocoumarins with under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Phosphonylation of Chiral Cyclic Imines for the Synthesis of Phosphoproline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective phosphonylation of the chiral cyclic imines were obtained from L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid in the presence of TiCl4. A complex between the imine, carbonyl group of the ester, and titanium was took place. Then, selective trans attack by (EtO)3P moiety from the opposite less hindered face (re) would account for the diastereoselectivity. The first synthesis of (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(phosphono)&#8208;proline was reported herein.







Abstract
We report here the first diastereoselective synthesis of (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(phosphono)&#8208;proline, a phosphoproline derivative from L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid. The main feature of this methodology is the transformation of L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid into chiral cyclic imines as a versatile intermediate followed by diastereoselective nucleophilic addition of trialkyl phosphites or diethyl phosphite in the presence of PhB(OH)2, Ph2P(O)OH, (PhO)2P(O)OH, Ph(H)P(O)OH and TiCl4. N&#8208;Cbz Cleavage with simultaneous hydrolysis of phosphonate and carboxylate esters in the quaternary cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate, gave the target compound.

         <dc:description>
A versatile and efficient methodology for the synthesis of 1&#8208;methyl and 1,4&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;formylcarbazoles is described. Microwave&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot cascade reactions of 4&#8208;oxazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones afforded methylated diarylamines, which were cyclized into a series of carbazoles, including the formal total synthesis of the naturally occurring pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]carbazole alkaloids ellipticine and olivacine.







Abstract
New and efficient strategies for the conversion of 4&#8208;oxazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones into 1&#8208;methyl and 1,4&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;formylcarbazoles are herein described. Highly convergent cascade and one&#8208;pot processes afforded the corresponding diarylamines, as in&#8197;situ formed synthetic intermediates or final products in high overall yields. Special attention was given to the synthesis of methylated carbazoles by reacting 4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with enones under microwave irradiation. The carbazole scaffold was provided by the palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H activation to generate oxidative cyclization of diarylamines. This methodology allowed for formal total syntheses of four naturally occurring pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]carbazole alkaloids ellipticine, 9&#8208;methoxyellipticine, olivacine, and 9&#8208;methoxyolivacine.

         <title>Dearomative Cycloaddition of an Isolable Dialkylsilylene with Diaryl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative cycloaddition of dialkylsilylene 1 with diaryl ketones to afford 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes was examined. The cycloaddition proceeded faster with electron&#8208;rich diaryl ketones and occurred preferentially at an electron&#8208;rich aryl group in unsymmetrical diaryl ketones. Theoretical studies indicate that this reaction proceeds through the formation of a silylene&#8208;carbonyl complex.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloaddition of silylenes with diaryl ketones is an attractive chemical transformation to 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (o&#8208;isotoluene) derivatives. We found that the dearomative (1+4) cycloadditions of an isolable dialkylsilylene (1) proceed faster with electron&#8208;rich diaryl ketones and preferentially occur at an electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted diaryl ketones. Theoretical calculations indicated a carbonyl silaylide (a silylene&#8208;ketone complex) is a key intermediate which is mainly stabilized by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions of a lone pair orbital on oxygen atom of the diaryl ketones and a vacant 3p orbital of 1. The carbonyl silaylide undergoes the Si&#8722;C bond formation at the ortho&#8208;position of one aryl ring to form a formal (1+4) cycloadduct with a very small activation barrier. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the (1+4) cycloadducts reveals their o&#8208;isotoluene structures. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of the (1+4) cycloadducts in hexane exhibit a &#960;&#8208;&#960;* (HOMO&#8208;LUMO) transition around 370&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Angucycline/Tetrangulol Derivatives Using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling and Ring&#8208;Closing Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;closing carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis in the presence of catalytic FeCl3 of the biaryl compound allowed for the formation of 1,7,12&#8208;trimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyltetraphene, which could be oxidized into the corresponding p&#8208;quinone, a derivative of the natural product tetrangulol.







Abstract
Key steps in the synthesis of derivatives of the angucycline, tetrangulol include the use of a palladium catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the assembly of 2&#8208;(1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde from 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;(1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolane. The biaryl product was then subjected to an iron&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction to afford 1,7,12&#8208;trimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyltetraphene, which was oxidized to the corresponding quinone. Late stage oxidation of the quinone with Ru[Cl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and an oxidant unexpectedly afforded the chlorinated compounds, 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;11&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyltetraphene&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione and 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyltetraphene&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione.

         <dc:description>
Graphitic carbon nitrides bonded with nickel can induce mild aerobic oxidative coupling reactions. Amidation of aldehydes with amines was reported, as well as the cross&#8208;coupling of C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;C aryl halides with amines, alcohols, and carboxylic acid.







Abstract
Dual nickel/carbon nitride (Ni/g&#8208;C3N4) photocatalyst was employed for the synthesis a wide range of amide derivatives by cross&#8208;coupling reaction of benzamides with aryl halides. Also, oxidative amidation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with primary and secondary amines has been investigated. The synthesis of various derivatives of esters was performed based on the cross&#8208;coupling reaction between carboxylic acids with aryl halides. Surprisingly, decarboxylation of carboxylic acid derivatives occurred under ambient conditions for the synthesis of biaryl derivatives. The reactions were run solvent&#8208;free or in environmental benignant solvents, with recyclable photocatalysts under irradiation.

         <title>Front Cover: Light as a Tool in Organic Photocatalysis: Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation and Chromoselective Reactions (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 24/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover represents light as a multi&#8208;tool, where each tool is a specific property of light, such as intensity or color. In photocatalysis, light can be used to control the activity and selectivity of a chemical reaction by choosing a suitable &#8220;light tool&#8221;. Control over photon flux and wavelength allows for multi&#8208;photon excitation and chromoselective reactions. More information can be found in the Review by Y. Markushyna and A. Savateev.

         <title>Cover Feature: Homogeneous Systems Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes for Photoactivated CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 24/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates, inspired by nature, the photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction which has a high potential for a successful transition towards renewable energy sources and decreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. In artificial systems, new photosensitizers and catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals should combine high efficiency and low environmental footprint. Photoinduced e&#8208; transfer processes reduce CO2 into valuable chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methane. More information can be found in the Review by C. Bizzarri.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, homogeneous earth&#8208;abundant systems that can photoactivate CO2 reduction by means of visible light are reported. In particular, advances on this topic of the past five years (2017&#8211;2021) are reviewed.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 into advantageous chemicals is a noteworthy pathway to close the carbon cycle and decrease carbon footprint. The use of visible light and ultimately solar radiation is extremely interesting in managing energy issues. Similarly, the employment of cost&#8208;effective materials guides to environmentally friendly applications. This Review addresses the homogeneous systems used for photoactivated the CO2 reduction in the last years, highlighting the earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based components. Besides those systems composed only of noble metal&#8208;free units, hybrid systems, also containing a noble metal&#8208;based complex, are also examined, revealing that research needs to increase the attention on more sustainable alternatives.

         <title>Light as a Tool in Organic Photocatalysis: Multi&#8208;Photon Excitation and Chromoselective Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 24, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes recent advancements in photocatalysis related to the applications of light as a tool for controlling the reactions selectivity and reactivity. The concepts and applications of multi&#8208;photon excitation photoredox catalysis and chromoselective catalysis in organic synthesis are discussed.







Abstract
Over the past decades, photoredox catalysis has developed to the big mature field of chemistry. Especially in the field of organic synthesis, more and more sustainable alternatives to conventional synthesis are being developed. Nonetheless, most research activities are focused on the development of new synthetic pathways, utilizing photons as a source of energy for breaking and building of new chemical bonds. We discuss here cases, where selection of the irradiation mode, light intensity (one&#8208;, two&#8208; photons) or wavelength (UV, blue, green) has a crucial role on the outcome of the photocatalytic event. Thus, control over irradiation conditions influence the reaction mechanism and offers an access to highly reactive species that are otherwise hardly available. This allows for the unique chemical events to happen, such as deep reduction reactions. The principles of these concepts and their applications are reviewed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <dc:description>In this study, we have developed efficient strategies for the synthesis of glycosyl donors with 2&#8208;thioacetyl (SAc) groups in order to synthesize 2&#8208;deoxysugars with absolute &#945;/&#946;&#8208;configuration. Starting from free methyl glycosides, four methyl 2&#8208;SAc glycosides were synthesized with high efficiency mainly through the double serial inversion strategy, and further turned into four corresponding 1&#8208;OAc, 2&#8208;SAc &#945;&#8208;glycosyl donors (manno&#8208;, gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and talo&#8208;types) and four corresponding 1&#8208;STol, 2&#8208;SAc 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosyl donors (manno&#8208;, gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and talo&#8208;types).

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H Alkyne Annulation of Nonsymmetric Imidazoles: Mechanistic Insights by Computation and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazoles constitute an important class of heterocyclic compounds with extensive potential use, from pharmaceuticals to optoelectronics. However, synthetic methodologies capable of producing novel nonsymmetric imidazoles are still scarce. In a combined synthesis, photophysical and computational investigation, we show that ruthenium(II) catalysis enables C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H alkyne annulation of nonsymmetric imidazoles derived from naturally occuring &#946;&#8208;lapachone and nor&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lapachone. This method provides an efficient and versatile tool for synthesizing fluorescent compounds with a broad application range.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Kinetic Resolution to Access Enantiomerically Enriched Dihydropyrimidinone/Thiones through Recognition of a Remote Stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

         <dc:description>A vast variety of oxidation procedures is known to obtain 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) moieties from its piperidinyl precursor. However, up to now no comprehensive study has been performed concerning the performance and feasibility for lab&#8208;scale synthesis. With the focus on the ease of synthesis, occurring impurities, the reaction yield and the degree of oxidation (DoO), this study represents a thorough investigation of different oxidation processes yielding  N  &#8208;oxyl radicals in a one&#8208;step procedure. The resulting materials were investigated by redox titration and electron spin resonance spectroscopy to determine the DoO, which is the determining parameter for the yield of this oxidation reaction. The most promising procedures have been transferred to a polymeric material to evaluate the feasibility of the catalysts for more complex substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis and Chemoinformatics: A Fruitful Synergy towards Better Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In these two decades, Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis (DOS) has changed significantly: from the historical focus on structural diversity, new approaches have been developed in order to increase the biological outcome of the molecules within the library, such as the privileged&#8208;based DOS or the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Fluorescence Library Approach (DOFLA). In this context, chemoinformatics can assist organic chemists in identifying biologically&#8208;relevant regions of the chemical space not yet explored. Also, chemoinformatics tools can be used to graphically visualize and/or predict the structural diversity and complexity of the compounds within the library. This review highlights the improvement that DOS has received from chemoinformatics, presenting recent articles (published between 2016 and 2021) in which DOS libraries are analysed by chemoinformatics tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Analytical Evaluation of Fsp3&#8208;Inspired Raman Probes for Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fraction of sp  3&#160;&#8208;hybdrised carbons (Fsp  3  ) in drug candidates and other biologically relevant compounds has been proposed to be an important physicochemical consideration within medicinal chemistry. Currently available small&#8208;molecule probes for Raman imaging are not optimised for biological applications. We sought to improve upon the highly Raman&#8208;active, yet rigid, lipophilic, and aggregative, bisarylbutadiyne (BADY) motif by introducing Fsp  3  character. BADY analogues were designed, efficiently synthesised, and analysed by mass spectrometry &#8211; revealing a statistical correlation between compound aggregation and cLog  P  , but no correlation with sp  3  . However, X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrated that the modifications to the BADY structure had a marked effect on crystal packing, suggesting Fsp  3  may still be important in reducing intermolecular stacking, and thus aggregation, of BADY. Cellular imaging by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allowed comparison of the intracellular distribution of the tags, guiding the design of future Raman probes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) was synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment ( &#956;  0  ) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (  Ea  ), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;  0  and a lowering of the  Ea  value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8208;30 kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment  .</dc:description>

         <title>A green multicomponent domino Mannich&#8208;Michael reaction to synthesize novel naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols with antiproliferative and antioxidant activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8208;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8208;47.95 &#181;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaching Room&#8208;Temperature Mesomorphism through Expansion of the Tristriazolotriazine Core with Alkoxybenzoate Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tristriazolotriazine (TTT)  N  &#8208;heterocycle, despite being a relatively new mesogenic core for use in discotic liquid crystals, has already demonstrated its importance and promising characteristics. In this work, we extended the knowledge about the TTT, increasing the core size with alkoxybenzoate units, as well as evaluating how the expansion and number of peripheral chains affected the thermal and photophysical properties, both in solution and spin&#8208;coated films. Their thermal behaviour and self&#8208;assembly were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, while the photophysics was investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that despite a considerable decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield with the core expansion, the mesomorphic properties are significantly enhanced, with two products showing Col  h  mesophase at room temperature, with large range of mesomorphism and very good thermal stability. It was also demonstrated how structural changes affected the self&#8208;assembly properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Iodine Mediated Oxidation of Arylated &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Sulfoxonium Ylides to 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoxonium ylides in recent years have proved to be versatile building blocks and have found applications towards the synthesis of structurally diverse organic molecules. In this research article, we delineate a new oxidative, molecular iodine&#8208;mediated transformation on sterically encumbered arylated sulfoxonium ylides, that give access to 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl containing compounds. Twenty&#8208;six examples have been realized (49&#8208;92% yields), with structural diversity modified at two key sites on the sulfoxonium ylide reactants. Furthermore, the protocol benefits from the use of inexpensive molecular iodine to mediate the oxidation and, from a sustainability viewpoint, short reaction times (30 minutes), ambient temperature, and ethyl acetate as a greener reaction solvent. Experimental studies also gave insight to the mechanism of the reaction, involving DMSO as an oxygen source.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Isomerization of Unprotected Mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic Olefins and Their Lewis Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, novel C5&#8208;position unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids in experiment. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in a very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner by using a combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208; p &#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes under the catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperature for few hours. This is one of the unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Greener Synthesis of Pyrroloquinazoline Derivatives: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucose in Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective modification of carbohydrate residues in glycopeptides is highly relevant as a tool in glycobiology. Oxidation in particular allows subsequent ligation with a label or handle and can be effectuated enzymatically or chemically. Chemical oxidation of carbohydrate residues in glycopeptides is nearly invariably done using periodate cleavage, leading to aldehydes. In this work we apply palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation for the same purpose. The catalyst, [(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2, developed for the site&#8208;selective oxidation of mono&#8208; and oligosaccharides on preparative scale, proved suitable for the oxidation of glucose residues in a series of glucopeptides. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions is necessary to get acceptable conversions without excessive over&#8208;oxidation of amino acid side&#8208;chains, in particular threonine. The resulting carbonyl function can be used for an oxime&#8208;ligation to biotin. A protocol for the analysis of the products using mass spectrometry is presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods. This review is not comprehensive. It aims to provide the reader with a selection of representative synthetic strategies available in the area up to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Sea Discovery and Detective Work: Towards Solving the Hemicalide Structural Enigma through Computational NMR Analysis and Stereocontrolled Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights how the judicious and synergistic application of computational NMR analysis and stereocontrolled synthesis has enabled the incremental assignment of hemicalide&#8208;a complex and extraordinarily bioactive marine polyketide containing 21 unknown stereocentres.







Abstract
The marine natural product hemicalide displays potent anticancer activity. While detailed NMR experiments established the planar carbon skeleton, its full configurational assignment proved enigmatic. This Review summarises ongoing synthetic efforts and NMR studies on hemicalide, which have succeeded in reducing the number of possible stereoisomers from more than one million to a more manageable eight structures, setting the stage for a focused total synthesis campaign.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

         <title>Parallel Screening with 14C&#8208;Labeled Carbon Dioxide: De&#8208;risking the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA drugs.







Abstract
Carbon isotope labeling is a useful technology for tracking the fate of organic compounds in the environment and in living organisms. In this context, the development of robust and general methodologies amenable to the direct functionalization of CO2 remains a significant task. In this communication, a de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence for carbon isotope labeling. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA approved drugs.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Isosorbide Imidates by Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regiodivergent synthesis of exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates containing biologically relevant N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzothiazole, benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole) has been achieved by oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis starting from aldimine starting materials. A large library of unprecedented high value&#8208;added products has been obtained with good levels of yield and regioselectivity.







Abstract
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;promoted regiodivergent protocol for exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates synthesis is described. The disclosed strategy allows the straightforward synthesis of monoimidate&#8208;isosorbides (MIIs) endowed with the biologically relevant benzothiazole (BTA) moiety under mild oxidative conditions, starting from easy&#8208;accessible aldimines. Process optimization encompassed the use of stoichiometric diquinone as well as atmospheric oxygen as oxidant species, focusing on reaction dichotomy between oxidative and oxygenative pathways. The reaction scope was investigated on a representative selection of BTA&#8208;containing aldimines and further extended to congeners bearing different biologically pivotal N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole), observing good levels of yield (up to 87&#8201;%) and regioselectivity (exo/endo up to 10.0; endo/exo up to 7.0). Furthermore, the employment of an immobilized&#8208;NHC under heterogeneous conditions was assessed, showing satisfactory selectivity towards exo&#8208;MIIs (exo/endo=3.8). Overall, the methodology presented provided an unprecedented collection of high value&#8208;added products with potential applications in different fields.

A selective deconstructive strategy of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizines to hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed and applied to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of cuscutamine. Additionally, controversy of the absolute configuration of the natural products was clarified.







Abstract
The general approach for accessing to a tetracyclic hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;indolizino[8,7&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;one alkaloids is that what involves the construction of the &#947;&#8208;lactam ring from a tricyclic precursor. Here in this report, we disclose a new synthetic strategy that permits the direct deconstruction of the tetracyclic indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizine motif into the tetracyclic hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one scaffold of the naturally occurring (+)&#8208;cuscutamine without the use of either transition or precious metals. Additionally, the current total synthesis of both enantiomers provides structural clarification of the natural occurring alkaloid.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Way Regioselective Synthesis of Amino&#8208;Acid Decorated Imidazole, Purine and Pyrimidine Derivatives by Multicomponent Chemistry Starting from Prebiotic Diaminomaleonitrile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid decorated imidazole, pyrimidine and purine derivatives, resembling analogues of peptide nucleic acid&#8217;s building blocks, have been synthesized by a three&#8208;way multicomponent chemistry of diaminomaleonitrile, one of the most studied chemical precursors in prebiotic chemistry. The regioselectivity of the multicomponent reaction between diaminomaleonitrile, trimethyl orthoacetate and a selected panel of a&#8208;amino acids, was controlled by the energy source used for triggering the condensation. Imidazole derivatives were obtained under thermal condition, while photochemical and combined photothermal conditions afforded pyrimidine and purine derivatives, respectively. The three synthetic pathways were independent of each other, the type of product being controlled by the chemical intermediates prevailing in the reaction mixture. In addition to the synthetic potential of these multicomponent reactions in the preparation of a large variety of heterocycles, the control of the synthesis of peptide nucleic acid&#8217;s building blocks, simply by changing the nature of the energy source, further enlarged the chemical complexity available in prebiotic conditions for the emergence of pristine pre&#8208;genetic codes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral isoxazole and carbocyclic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues were synthesized via (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of chiral pyrimidinyl&#8208;substituted dimethyl cyclopropanedicarboxylates. In the presence of MgI  2  , (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of chiral pyrimidinyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes with nitrosoarenes afforded diverse chiral isoxazole pyrimidine nucleoside analogues in up to 78% yield and 88&#8208;96% ee. Using Nd(OTf)  3  as the catalyst, the annulation reaction with silyl enol ethers generated a series of chiral carbocyclic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues in up to 64% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, and 87&#8208;96% ee. The proposed methods either reduced or avoided partial racemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Molecular Shape on the Properties of Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole&#8208;Based Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>A concave indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole&#8208;based compound was synthesized and characterized, which was further compared with the property of its planar congener. The results reveal that the change in molecular shape alters the molecular electronic structure, thus leading to the reduced aromaticity and divergent energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals of the concave compound. Moreover, the bowl&#8208;shaped molecule demonstrates a blue&#8208;shift in the UV/vis absorption and a red&#8208;shift in the weakened fluorescence emission due to the vibration of the concave face.</dc:description>

The present approach utilizes the intramolecular Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction as the key step for the synthesis of tamiflu. On the other hand, diene containing allylic aziridine framework is found to be inefficient to furnish the six&#8208;membered core skeleton of tamiflu through ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards the Synthesis of Highly Hindered Pyrrolidines by Intramolecular AAC Click Reactions: What Can Be Learned from DFT Calculations?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthesis of a highly substituted biomass&#8208;derived chiral pyrrolidine conveniently functionalized to obtain macrocycles through intramolecular &#8220;click&#8221; reactions is reported. The experimental difficulties encountered during the macrocyclization stage led us to conduct an extensive DFT study to understand the origins of the findings. The results obtained suggest that the improper conformational landscape of the reactant precludes the pre&#8208;organization required to connect the reactive moieties. We propose that the cumulative Boltzmann amplitudes of reactive conformations (CBAR) prove to be a simple and useful parameter to predict the success or failure of related transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#945;,6&#946;&#8208;Dihydroxyandrostan&#8208;17&#8208;one 3&#8208;Glucuronides for the Detection of Testosterone Misuse</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The convenient synthesis of two 3&#8208;glucuronide conjugates of 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyandrosterone (6OH&#8208;And&#8208;3G  2  ) and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyetiocholanolone (6OH&#8208;Etio&#8208;3G  3  ) is reported. The conjugates are identified as long&#8208;term markers of endogenous androgenic anabolic steroid abuse in doping control studies. Their resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis by  E. coli  &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase means they may be missed by conventional GC&#8208;MS analysis protocols. One promising strategy to quantify these markers is by direct methods, which requires sufficient quantities of high purity reference materials. Our convergent synthesis features concurrent stereoselective introduction of 5&#945;/5&#946; hydrogen and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxy groups on the steroid skeleton, and a mild Schmidt trichloroacetimidate glycosylation strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Reaction of Phenols with Spirocylic &#955;3&#8208;iodanes: Access to both 2&#8208;Iodovinyl Aryl Ethers and Diaryl Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient method for vinyl or aryl C(sp 2 )&#8208;O bond forming to construct both the ( Z )&#8208;2&#8208;iodovinyl aryl ethers and diaryl ethers under metal&#8208;, photocatalyst&#8208; and light&#8208;free condition in one&#8208;step, has been developed. To generate the two desired products, we proposed a S NAr 2 reaction of phenol with vinyl aryl iodonium salts intermediates that subsequently lead to the phenyl&#8208;I bond cleavage and phenyl&#8208;O bond formation. We firstly found that the vinyl aryl iodonium salts was formed in situ from the spiro&#8208; cis &#8208; &#946; &#8208;phenol&#8208;VBXs, which was generated between electrophilic spiro&#8208;EBXs and nucleophilic arylols. Tri&#8208;substituted alkenes and functionalized diaryl ethers can be afforded from the two desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Reductive Alkylation of Indoles: Late&#8208;Stage Diversification for Bioactive Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles was well established, which exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, this environmental&#8208;friendly methodology also finds application in the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH for the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmental&#8208;friendly process exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8722;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive computational study of the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism is reported. Up to 32 &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical/organic halide combinations are explored to understand the effect of the C&#8722;X bond, the influence of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical properties and the alkyl or aryl character of the reactive C center in the reactivity.







Abstract
Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8211;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents, although the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 32&#8197;reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8722;X and Cy&#8722;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions prove to be highly reliable when &#946;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;amino boronic esters are employed as the amine component, allowing the efficient synthesis of unprecedented peptidomimetics and heteroatom&#8208;rich boron&#8208;containing small molecules.

         <dc:description>2,6&#8208;Disubstituted cuneane has potential as a p &#8208;disubstituted benzene bioisostere and a novel chiral scaffold. It is a constitutional isomer of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane obtained via a metal&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement. Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6&#8208;disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing C 2 symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd&#8208;pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Photocatalyzed Halogen&#8208;Radical Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis is a method of choice for the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Review collects the recent examples exploiting this manifold to generate highly aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. Available strategies to influence site&#8208;selectivity of the hydrogen atom transfer step have also been discussed.







Abstract
The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.

         <title>Robust Synthesis of Tetra&#8208;Boronate Esters Analogues and the Corresponding Boronic Acids Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and robust synthetic strategy that could build a series of tetra&#8208;boronate analogues in gram&#8208;scale is reported. Further, a universal deprotection condition that allows the direct transformation of tetra&#8208;boronates to their corresponding boronic acids is also included in this study.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications, because of their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkene Formation from Reductive Aldehyde Homo&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the PIII of a phosphanyl phosphonate reagent MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2 (see Figure) renders the reductive aldehyde coupling of aldehydes selectively for the thermodynamically less stable Z&#8208;olefin product.







Abstract
Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E&#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z&#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2, 6, with an electron&#8208;deficient MesF=2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z&#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient MesF, which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of MesF, the E&#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P&#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of the Z&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Aerobic Baeyer&#8722;Villiger oxidation catalyzed by metal corroles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Substrate Photoswitching for Rate Enhancement of a Organocatalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organocatalysis, many transformations require quite high catalyst loadings, as the processes are sluggish and complex equilibria are involved. Here, in&#8197;situ light irradiation with a specific wavelength inside NMR is applied to increase reaction rates of hydrazone cyclization. This enhancement was achieved by isomerizing the substrate to the reactive configuration.







Abstract
In this article, we report that applying in&#8197;situ LED&#8208;NMR irradiation with appropriate wavelength resulted in the photoswitching of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazone C=N double bond configuration. This reaction was previously reported to be the first step in a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction, where the minor but stable Z&#8208;isomer is the reactive intermediate. By enhancing the rate of the isomerization, we could show that the overall rate of the cyclization could be increased and followed directly by NMR kinetics. Exclusively light with a specific wavelength matching the isomerization process affected the cyclization. The light&#8208; and acid&#8208;mediated isomerization provide complementary pathways that can be exploited in synthetic applications to increase reaction rates of asymmetric transformations, especially in reactions requiring high loadings of elaborate chiral catalysts.

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

&lt;p&gt;A novel &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2-dihydro-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrrolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indolizin-3-one and 1,5-disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one-pot process involving four-step reactions was developed. The first process is a one-pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylated tetrazole. Consequently, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one-pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent antagonists able to reach the four carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of DC&#8208;SIGN have been prepared. The extended rigid core of these glycodendrimers allows multivalent presentation of glycomimetic molecules in a spatially defined fashion, providing high affinity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and selectivity over other C&#8208;type lectins featuring distinct CRD arrangements. The constructs successfully inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and DC&#8208;SIGN mediated trans&#8208;infection by Ebola virus.







Abstract
Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. In this work, we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus trans&#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.

Room temperature, Liquid assisted grinding was used for the synthesis 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and atom economic process bearing wide substrate scope and the isolation of products is chromatography free. It shows an efficient application of mechanochemical synthesis and also exemplifies green chemistry.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <title>Versatility of the Amino Group in Hydrazone&#8208;based Molecular and Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazones are common building blocks of supramolecular entities because they can undergo conformational, configurational, and/or constitutional changes in response to an external stimulus. This Review explores the important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in these different dynamics in molecular and supramolecular systems published in the last decades. Some synthetic methodologies to obtain them are also described.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;based systems have been, and continue to be, widely studied in the field of supramolecular chemistry due to the chemical versatility of their triatomic C=N&#8208;N structure, whose amino nitrogen commonly bears a methyl group or a hydrogen atom. Herein we review the conformational, configurational, and constitutional dynamics of these systems, focusing on the particularly important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in each of those processes observed in molecular and supramolecular systems published in recent decades. Due to the enormous diversity of supramolecular architectures and molecular entities, the most representative synthetic methodologies to obtain them are described.

         <title>Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin&#8208;like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L&#8208;fucose, D&#8208;galactose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe7 and Arg8), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser3, Pro4, and Val13).







Abstract
Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA&#8208;conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17 were crucial for binding BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose, BSA&#8208;D&#8208;galactose and BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser3, Pro4, and Val13 resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg8 plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose/D&#8208;galactose from BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine.

     alt="Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin-like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L-fucose, D-galactose and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Lys&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Tyr&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, Leu&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, and Thr&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and Arg&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pro&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and Val&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA-conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Phe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Tyr&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, Gly&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, Leu&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, and Thr&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; were crucial for binding BSA-L-fucose, BSA-D-galactose and BSA-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pro&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and Val&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA-L-fucose/D-galactose from BSA-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The thermodynamics of binding of the selected alanine analogues was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Low to moderate binding affinities were determined for the tetravalent MUC1 glycopeptide and asialofetuin, respectively, and high for the fucose rich polysaccharide, fucoidan. The thermodynamic profile of interactions with asialofetuin exhibits shift to an entropy-driven mechanism compared to the fucoidan, which displayed an enthalpy-entropy compensation, typically associated with the carbohydrate-lectin recognition process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>A Photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama Reaction Catalytic in Chromium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylation of aldehydes is possible by a real photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.







Abstract
Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <title>A Clickable Bioorthogonal Sydnone&#8208;Aglycone for the Facile Preparation of a Core 1 O&#8208;Glycan&#8208;Array</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of sydnone&#8208;modified mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycan structures were synthesized chemoenzymatically, allowing for the facile preparation of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;array, by means of metal&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC), for studying O&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation has been shown to be essential for many biological processes. However, determining the exact relationship between O&#8208;glycan structures and their biological activity remains challenging. Here we report that, unlike azides, sydnones can be incorporated as an aglycon into core 1 O&#8208;glycans early&#8208;on in their synthesis since it is compatible with carbohydrate chemistry and enzymatic glycosylations, allowing us to generate a small library of sydnone&#8208;containing core 1 O&#8208;glycans by chemoenzymatic synthesis. The sydnone&#8208;aglycon was then employed for the facile preparation of an O&#8208;glycan array, via bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction, and in turn was utilized for the high&#8208;throughput screening of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;lectin interactions.

     alt="A Clickable Bioorthogonal Sydnone-Aglycone for the Facile Preparation of a Core 1 O-Glycan-Array"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small library of sydnone-modified mucin-type &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan structures were synthesized chemoenzymatically, allowing for the facile preparation of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan-array, by means of metal-free strain-promoted sydnone-alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC), for studying &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan-protein interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation has been shown to be essential for many biological processes. However, determining the exact relationship between &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan structures and their biological activity remains challenging. Here we report that, unlike azides, sydnones can be incorporated as an aglycon into core 1 &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycans early-on in their synthesis since it is compatible with carbohydrate chemistry and enzymatic glycosylations, allowing us to generate a small library of sydnone-containing core 1 &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycans by chemoenzymatic synthesis. The sydnone-aglycon was then employed for the facile preparation of an &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan array, via bioorthogonal strain-promoted sydnone-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction, and in turn was utilized for the high-throughput screening of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;glycan-lectin interactions. This sydnone-aglycon, particularly adapted for &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycomics, is a valuable chemical tool that complements the limited technologies available for investigating &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan structure-activity relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

         <dc:description>
An expedient method for the preparation of unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes from para&#8208;quinone methides and derivatives of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline under copper catalysis is described.







Abstract
A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substrates.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <title>Chemical Biology of &#945;GalCer: A Chemist's Toolbox for the Stimulation of Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to the chemist's toolbox for the stimulation of invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells. This Review encompasses the synthetic strategies for the preparation of the iNKT cell agonist &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer), its TH1/TH2 skewing analogs, and other synthetic probes for the elucidation of mechanisms of &#945;GalCer trafficking.







Abstract
Often referred to as the &#8220;Swiss Army knife&#8221; of the immune system, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes stimulated by the synthetic glycolipid &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) when in complex with the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells. Through their ability to produce TH1 and TH2 cytokines and co&#8208;stimulate several other lymphocytes, iNKT cells have emerged as central players in directing the immune response in a range of physiological processes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Over the years, synthetic chemistry has advanced the field of iNKT cell stimulation with the development of more efficient approaches to prepare &#945;GalCer, and, additionally, with the chemical synthesis of &#945;GalCer analogs in the search of better TH1/TH2 cytokine skewing compounds for therapeutic applications. Here, we review the strategies for the synthesis of &#945;GalCer and its analogs, including synthetic probes, together with the most important advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds, as a guide to the available tools for interrogating the iNKT cell&#8722;&#945;GalCer&#8722;CD1d complex and inspiration for future research.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8211;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

         <title>Quinazoline&#8208;Assisted ortho&#8208;Halogenation with N&#8208;Halosuccinimides through Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt; can be regarded as carbon-based bioisosteres of 6-Deoxy-&#946;-&lt;i&gt;ido&lt;/i&gt;-heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (&lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt;) were efficiently synthesized from a &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-2 activated &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;i&gt;galacto&lt;/i&gt;-octopyranuronate (&lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt;) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;i&gt;ido&lt;/i&gt;-octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one-pot process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

         <title>Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation and Etherification Reactions of Benzylic Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistriflimide&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of benzylacetates with both trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes lead to propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The acid assists the release of the reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the media, which is the ultimate catalytic species. The cationic nature of the processes is documented.







Abstract
Addition of catalytic amounts of bistriflimide triggers useful coupling reactions of benzyl acetates with trimethyl(alkynyl)silanes and trimethyl(alkoxy)silanes to afford propargyl arenes and benzyl alkyl ethers, respectively. The added acid assists the release of reactive trimethylsilylium ion into the reaction media, which were found to act as the ultimate catalytic species responsible for the C&#8722;C and the C&#8722;O forming steps. The cationic nature of these coupling processes is documented.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

         <title>The Structure of Hemicalide from the Marine Sponge Hemimycale sp</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemicalide, isolated from the marine sponge Hemimycale sp., is a very potent cytotoxic compound from a marine sponge with an original mode of action. Its planar structure has been established by NMR and a proposal for 17 of its 21 stereogenic centers is made on the basis of syntheses of analogues.







Abstract
Hemicalide is a marine natural product isolated from the sponge Hemimycale sp., collected near the Torres Islands of Vanuatu. It is characterized by cytotoxicity in the sub&#8208;nanomolar range, with an original mode of action. This article describes the establishment of the planar structure of hemicalide, based on extensive use of 2D&#8208;NMR experiments. The molecule belongs to the polyketide class with an irregular combination of acetates and propionates and adorned with two unusual hydroxylated six&#8208;membered ring lactones. After publication of the original patent, groups in Paris and Cambridge (UK) launched synthetic programmes with the aim of elucidating the configurations of some of the 21 stereogenic centers. The second part of the article discusses these achievements and presents the best hypothesis, to date, for hemicalide.

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using metalloid&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly, substrate compatibility was explored. 21 new disulfide and thioether macrocycles were synthesized that incorporated a wide breadth of structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.

Based on SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed. Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene Carbonates from Aromatic Aldehydes
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes and diphenyl carbonate through an organocatalyzed Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Substituted vinylene carbonates were directly prepared from aromatic aldehydes following a one&#8208;pot Benzoin condensation/transcarbonation sequence under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The combination of a N&#8208;phenyl substituted triazolium salt NHC precursor and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was found essential to reach high yield and selectivity. The reaction scope was investigated with a range of aromatic aldehydes and the corresponding vinylene carbonates were obtained with 32&#8211;86&#8201;% isolated yields (14&#8197;examples).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

         <title>Divergent Annulation of Spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and Fused (Epoxyetheno)indeno&#8208;Furan from 1,2&#8208;Diketone and 1&#8208;Cyanoketone</title>

         <dc:description>
A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis Enables the Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Olefins Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins with carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed, which is based on visible&#8208;light photoredox/boronic acid catalysis. The direct use of CAs as acyl&#8208;radical precursors was made possible with the aid of boronic acid, and CAs were easily converted into the corresponding cyclic ketones without the need for any stoichiometric activating reagents.







Abstract
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins using carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed. With the aid of a boronic acid, CAs can be used as acyl&#8208;radical precursors in catalytic photoredox reactions driven by visible light. The CAs are easily converted into their corresponding cyclic ketones without the need to use any stoichiometric activating reagents. Mechanistic studies implied that the formation of an &#8220;ate&#8221; complex from the CA and boronic acid is crucial for the generation of the acyl radical equivalent from the unreactive carboxy group.
