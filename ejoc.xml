         <title>Porous Organic Compounds &#8211; Small Pores on the Rise</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are important for various energy&#8208;related technologies such as catalysis and separation. While porous organic cage compounds are a rather recent addition to the field of porous materials, these discrete nanocavities have since emerged as a versatile functional&#8208;materials platform, facilitated by the solubility of the materials in common organic solvents. In contrast to other frameworks, organic cages are assembled first from modular building blocks in solution and then pack in the solid&#8208;state in a next step. In this minireview, we highlight examples of porous organic cages with focus on how the intrinsic nanopore can be controlled and utilised, especially focusing on their synthesis and the gas sorption properties of smaller intrinsic pores of porous organic cage compounds, porous macrocycles and other related compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for highly regioselective cyanomethylation, etherification or acetonation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides at C5 position was developed, and such reactions proceed under transition metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for highly regioselective cyanomethylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides at C5 position was developed. Such reactions proceed under transition metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. This protocol features simple operation, high efficiency, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Moreover, the etherification or acetonation products were also obtained when acetonitrile was replaced by ethers or acetone, and a radical process was involved in the reaction.

An enantioselective Michael&#8208;Aldol[3+2] annulation via bifunctional thiourea catalysis has been reported, and a series of nitro&#8208;methanobenzo[7]annulenes with potential biological activities were synthesized in good yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
We report an enantioselective Michael&#8208;Aldol[3+2] annulation between 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxynaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones and nitroalkenes using a bifunctional thiourea catalyst, and a series of nitro&#8208;methanobenzo[7]annulenes with potential biological activities were synthesized in good yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further transformation of the product demonstrated the synthetic value of this reaction.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Mediated Non&#8208;Destructive Cyanide Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 5003-5007, September 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide promotes the formation of cyanohydrin in aqueous media and therefore, enabled to purify cyanide contaminated water without reactive oxidants and/or additional energy input. The method was tested in various conditions mimicking goldmine wastewater to elucidate the capacity of CO2&#8208;mediated cyanide remedy process.







Abstract
The facile removal of cyanide anions from cyanide&#8208;containing water was achieved using CO2 in conjunction with aldehydes which can be recycled from the process. The conversion of the cyanide ion into an insoluble cyanohydrin in water allowed the removal of cyanide and could be used as a method for treating cyanide contaminated wastewater and for recovering cyanide or cyanohydrins for further applications.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Molecules for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows an artistic rendition of a cell culture incorporating&#160;mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), illustrating different strategies in which they have been applied for biological and medical functions. MIMs have been used to create smart drugs and endow theranostic materials with advantageous properties. They have also been used to construct sensors for various biologically relevant targets. The special dynamic properties of rotaxanes have also been exploited to build transmembrane transporters. Another exciting avenue of research is the construction of functional mechanically interlocked protein&#8208; and DNA&#8208;structures. The authors would like to thank Dana Kauerhof for help with creating the graphic. More information can be found in the Minireview by J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C7 Halogenation of Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Rh&#8208;catalyzed catalytic method has been developed for selective C7 halogenation of N&#8208; pyrimidyl indolines with N &#8208;halosuccinimides (Cl, Br, I) to produce corresponding halides in good to excellent yields. The advantages of this strategy include broad substrate scope and excellent regioselectivity for C7 functionalization of indolines, and feasibility at gram scale level.&#160;&#160; Various control experiments have been performed to understand the reaction pathway. Applicability of current methodology has been demonstrated by indole synthesis, and post&#8208;transformation of the C7 halogenated indolines into different valuable molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Interactions of Cellulose Model Compound D&#8208;Cellobiose with Selected Metal Chlorides in Water: Identification of Chelating Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 4968-4973, September 21, 2021. </description>

A DFT study shows that metal ions prefer to approach between the two glucose rings in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;cellobiose while interacting/chelating with hydroxyl oxygen atoms of the disaccharide in aqueous medium. In the series of Li+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sn2+, Zn2+ and La3+ chlorides studied, ZnCl2 was identified as the most strongly interacting metal salt.







Abstract
Understanding interactions of metal ions with cellulose is an important step in the development of efficient catalytic methods for processing cellulose. In this study, density functional theory methods were used to identify oxygen atoms interacting or chelating with selected metal chlorides of Li+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sn2+, Zn2+ and La3+ with cellulose model compound D&#8208;cellobiose. Calculated metal&#8208;oxygen distances of energy minimized D&#8208;cellobiose : metal chloride 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixtures revealed that the metal ions approach between the two glucose rings in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;cellobiose, and O4, O9 are the preferred interaction/chelation points. DFT study supported a previous 13C NMR chemical shift change based experiments. ZnCl2 showing the shortest metal&#8208;oxygen distances in approach to &#945;/&#946; D&#8208;cellobiose is known to produce the largest 13C NMR chemical shift changes in D&#8208;cellobiose. In &#945;&#8208;anomer, average closest metal&#8208;oxygen distances and NMR shift changes co&#8208;related at 95&#8201;% confidence interval with liner regression R2=0.8582 and Sy.x=0.5722.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridines From 1&#8208;Arylpyrroles via Successive Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 4974-4983, September 21, 2021. </description>

A wide variety of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridines can be obtained from commercially available compounds using only 2&#8197;mol% of easily available Pd(OAc)2 catalyst precursor and KOAc as inexpensive base. With this synthetic scheme, the introduction of desired functional groups at positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridines is possible.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulative &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 1&#8208;arylpyrroles using 1,2&#8208;dihalobenzenes as the coupling partners was investigated. The higher reactivity of pyrrole C2&#8722;H bond compared to C&#8722;H bonds of the aryl unit of 1&#8208;arylpyrroles allows selective synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridines via successive palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular followed by intramolecular direct arylation steps. From 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzenes bearing substituents at C4&#8208; or C5&#8208;positions and ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;arylpyrroles, the access to pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridines containing substituents at C5, C6, C7, C8, C10 and/or C11 positions is possible.

Oligonucleotides containing 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA were synthesized and their properties (duplex&#8208;forming ability toward ssRNA and ssDNA, triplex&#8208;forming ability toward dsDNA, thermodynamic parameters, and enzymatic stability) were investigated. The thermal stabilities of 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA&#8208; and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA&#8208;modified oligonucleotides when complexes with ssRNA and dsDNA under molecular crowding conditions were also examined.







Abstract
Novel 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (ENA) analogs with exocyclic methylene and (R)&#8208;methyl groups at the 6&#8242;&#8208;position were synthesized. The obtained 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA were incorporated into oligonucleotides, and their properties were compared with those of the corresponding natural, ENA&#8208;, and 6&#8242;S&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. The duplex&#8208;stabilizing ability of 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA with single&#8208;stranded RNA (ssRNA) was similar to that of ENA and 6&#8242;S&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA under both dilute and molecular crowding conditions. On the other hand, oligonucleotides containing 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA formed stable triplexes with double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) in comparison with those containing 6&#8242;S&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA. Their thermodynamic properties were also calculated to explore the influence of the substituents introduced at the 6&#8242;&#8208;position of ENA. Moreover, oligonucleotides with ENA analogs exhibited excellent resistance against nucleases. These results suggest that 6&#8242;&#8208;methylene&#8208;ENA and 6&#8242;R&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA are promising candidates for targeting ssRNA and dsDNA.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly versatile fluoroalkyl thiosulfonates and selenosulfonates have been used to introduce various fluorinated groups in an efficient and selective way. Their applicability is discussed in detail in this Minireview, and special focus is put on reactivity and activation modes.







Abstract
Reagent design is at the cornerstone of modern organofluorine chemistry. The past decades have seen the emergence of diverse families of reagents with the aim of introducing fluoroalkylthio or seleno groups in an efficient and selective way. Among them, highly versatile fluoroalkyl thiosulfonates and selenosulfonates are in the foreground of the recent developments. Their applicability is discussed in detail in this Minireview, with a specific focus on the reactivity and activation modes.

         <title>Aryl Fluoroalkyl Sulfoxides: Optical Stability And pKa Measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the introduction of fluorinated groups into molecules, which gives them interesting and sometimes unexpected physicochemical properties and reactivity. In this study, the configurational stability of fluoroalkyl sulfoxides (shown on the flyer) was investigated and the pKa value of the &#8208;CHF2 group was determined, which is very important for medicinal and agrochemical research. The picture is reminiscent of &#8220;Kinder Surpise&#8221;&#174; where the sulfoxide appears as an exciting molecular toy and the surprises are the physical data determined because nothing was known before about this type of compounds (copyright of the illustration by J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten). More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Hanquet, E. Magnier, F. R. Leroux et&#8197;al.

         <title>The current understanding of how 2D polymers grow photochemically</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D polymers are a relatively new class of macromolecules. It is not astounding therefore that so far research focussed on how to provide access to this intriguing class of organic 2D materials, how to prove their existence, and how to assess their structural quality. Studies concerning the formation mechanism are comparatively scarce. We here collect and compare all the mechanistic information available and point towards research directions to be followed in order to advance mechanistic understanding and, thus, fast development of this field. Because the two current starting situations for the photochemical synthesis of 2D polymers are layered single crystals and monolayers, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), local vibration spectroscopy, e.g. tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), e.g. low temperature Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (LT STM) in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV), but also Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), are the prominent analytical tools. With their advantages and shortcomings, they will therefore play an important role throughout this brief review&#8208;type article.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA Hydrolysis by Heterocyclic Amidines and Guanidines: Parameters Affecting Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminobenzimidazole  10  , although a weak catalyst in the monomeric state, is a successful building block for effective artificial ribonucleases. In an effort to identify new building blocks with improved catalytic potential, RNA cleavage by a variety of heterocyclic amidines and guanidines has been studied. In addition to p  K  a  values and steric effects, the energy difference between tautomeric forms seems to be another important parameter for catalysis. This information is available from quantum chemical calculations on higher levels, but semiempirical methods are sufficient to get a first estimate. According to this assumption, imidazoimidazol  18  , characterized by isoenergetic tautomeric forms, is superior to 2&#8208;aminoimidazol  6  , the best candidate among the simple compounds. By far the largest effects are seen with 2&#8208;aminoperimidine  24  which rapidly cleaves RNA even in the micromolar concentration range. The impressive reactivity, however, is related to a tendency of compound  24  to form polycationic aggregates which are the actual catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Lewis Basicities and Nucleophilicities of 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(dialkylamino)benzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Equilibrium constants for the formation of Wheland complexes from 1,3,5&#8208;tris(dialkylamino)benzenes and benzhydrylium ions (Ar  2  CH  +  )&#160;have been determined photometrically in dichloromethane&#160;at 20 &#176;C. The Lewis basicity of the ring carbons increases in the series trimorpholinobenzene &lt; tripiperidinobenzene &lt;tripyrrolidinobenzene. Complexes which are formed with equilibrium constants 10  2&#160;  &lt;&#160;  K  /M  &#8208;1&#160;  &lt;10  6  in the reactions of triaminobenzenes with carbenium ions show temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;NMR spectra, due to rapid reverse reactions and recombination at different positions of the Lewis bases. Since the rates of the formation of the Wheland complexes are too high to be measured directly, they were calculated as the product of photometrically determined equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the reverse reactions, which were derived from the dynamic  1  H NMR spectra. The experimental equilibrium and rate constants were in good agreement with the results of DFT calculations, that show that the complexes are thermodynamically more stable than the ammonium ions formed by attack of the benzhydrylium ions at the amino group of the title compounds, which explains the exclusive formation of Wheland complexes in thermodynamically controlled reactions. With nucleophilicity parameters in the range 10 &lt;  N  &lt; 15 the triaminobenzenes have comparable nucleophilic reactivities as enamines, silyl ketene acetals as well as stabilized phosphonium&#8208; and sulfonium ylides.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Aryl Alkynes for the Synthesis of 1,1&#8208;Diaryl and Triaryl Substituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;diaryl and triarylsubstituted alkenes has been developed utilizing B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynes with phenols. The method provide a direct route to  ortho  &#8208;alkenylated phenols with both terminal and internal alkynes. The reactions show excellent regioselectivity, and especially, good stereoselectivity was observed for the hydroarylation of internal alkynes. Computational and experimental studies suggest that for the reaction of internal alkynes and phenols, an acid&#8208;catalyzed isomerization mechanism involving two tertiary carbonium ion intermediates is responsible for the formation of  Z&#8208;triaryl substituted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the individual importance of the Pam2Cys ester motifs on TLR2 activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TLR2 agonists are at the forefront of vaccine research for a plethora of diseases, in particular they offer a promising tool for the treatment of cancer. A detailed knowledge of their structure&#8208;activity relationships informs the methodical design of vaccine constructs that include TLR2 agonists. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of analogues of the TLR2 agonist Pam 2 Cys to further probe structure&#8208;activity relationships. These analogues replace one or other of the two ester groups with ether functionalities to elucidate the role of the carbonyls on TLR2 activity. Through this we demonstrate that the C3 ester carbonyl is dispensable, but the C2 carbonyl is essential for activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Development in SmI2 Catalyzed Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI  2  ) is a versatile single electron transfer (SET) reagent in organic synthesis. The advantages of SmI  2  arise from various additive induced tailoring of a reaction to obtain a desired product in a stereoselective fashion. In most instances, this reagent is used in stoichiometric amount, and this poses a significant environmental issue limiting a broader applicability of SmI  2  . Despite challenges in the developments of catalytic methods, recent studies have paved the way for catalytic strategies rejuvenating the applications of SmI  2  in synthetic organic chemistry. This review aims to summarize different methods that are used to develop catalytic reactions of SmI  2  . A comparison of different approaches and future outlook of this field are discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles, providing a safer and seamless way for accelerating the isatin&#8208;acetone reaction at higher temperatures without compromising enantioselectivity is reported. Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;) and proticity (&#945;) of solvents were found to be crucial in describing the solubility of isatin and performance of L&#8208;leucinol organocatalyst and informed the choice of solvent for transfer to flow.







Abstract
An efficient L&#8208;leucinol catalysed asymmetric synthesis of 3&#8208;substitued&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles was for the first time completed under continuous flow, providing a safer route for accelerating the reaction at higher temperatures without adversely affecting enantioselectivity. Initial batch solvent screening of the isatin&#8208;acetone aldol reaction revealed neat acetone as the media best suited in flow as it dissolved isatin and afforded (S)&#8208;enantiomer of the adduct in 84&#8201;% ee. Solvents with Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;)&gt;0.6 and proticity (&#945;)&#8776;0 had a higher solubility of isatin but poor reaction performance while solvents with &#946;&lt;0.2 and &#945;&lt;0.6 performed excellently in the reaction albeit with poor isatin solubility. The addition of 10 equivalents of water improved the neat reaction to afford 94&#8201;% yield in 93&#8201;% ee at 20&#8201;&#176;C after 48&#8197;h. When transferred to continuous flow, complete conversion was observed in 12&#8197;h residence time at 40&#8201;&#176;C without loss in enantioselectivity. Further substrate studies in flow were undertaken with a 4&#8208;fold dilution and a 60&#8201;&#176;C reaction temperature required for some derivatives. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained in most cases.

A new family of phosphine&#8208;free, air and moisture stable ligand are developed for coupling reaction. The synthesised ligand efficiently catalyzed the coupling reaction with PdCl2. The main advantage of the developed protocol is the tolerance of wide substrate including sterically hindered substrates, low ligand loading and short reaction time with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yield.

The bidentate ligand act as efficient catalyst with combination of Pd (II) salt in the C&#8722;C bond formation and exhibited excellent performance in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Mizoroki&#8208;Heck coupling reaction. A broad range of substrates, including heterocyclic, flavones, Isatin and sterically hindered coupling partner, were well tolerated under the optimized reaction conditions. Metal complex and all the intermediates were formed in the catalytic cycle were characterized by mass spectrometry to support the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Class of Natural Product Crispine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 4911-4926, September 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented minireview provides an exclusive literature overview on the methodologies adopted for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline natural product crispine A over the last nine decades. The synthesis of crispine A was cumulated via Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization, Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization, N&#8208;alkylation/acylation cyclization, oxidative cyclization, asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, and other miscellaneous reactions.







Abstract
As a naturally occurring small&#8208;molecule, various optical isomers of chiral pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline alkaloid crispine A represent a potential class of chiral molecules in contemporary organic chemistry, and possess diverse biological activities. The range of pharmacological activities include antidepressant, antiplatelet, antileukemic, and anticancer activities. This review provides an overview of the literature on the strategies, employed in the synthesis of crispine A in their racemic and enantiopure forms via Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization, Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization, N&#8208;Alkylation/Acylation&#8208;cyclization, Oxidative cyclization, and Asymmetric hydrogenation in the period of 1931&#8211;2021. This study accentuates the need for the developing more effective synthesis, and search for involved biological applications for the pyrroloisoquinoline class of natural product. Attention has been drawn towards the use of relatively less documented but easily accessible naturally occurring diastereomeric scaffolds namely, garcinia and hibiscus acids. These lactones obtained from (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxycitric acids bearing chemically amenable functional groups are investigated as an ideal choice for the enantiopure synthesis of the (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;(S)&#8208;Crispine A structural frame work.

In control! Eliminative cross&#8208;coupling between enantioenriched lithiated allylic carbamates and enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;carbamoyloxyalkyl boronates provides for a stereospecific synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes. Any geometrical isomer of the conjugated diene product is available by an appropriate combination of stereochemical configurations within the carbenoid substrates and the type of elimination mechanism triggered (syn or anti).







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,3&#8208;butadienes were prepared in a stereocontrolled manner by carbenoid eliminative cross&#8208;coupling between stereodefined lithiated secondary allylic carbamates and &#945;&#8208;carbamoyloxyalkyl boronates. All four geometric isomers of 4,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylocta&#8208;3,5&#8208;diene were stereospecifically generated [yields 44&#8211;73&#8201;%, dr (&#916;3,4)=84&#8201;:&#8201;16 to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3] by appropriate combinations of (S,E)&#8208; or (S,Z)&#8208;i&#8208;PrCH=CHCLi(Me)OCb with (R)&#8208;Ph(CH2)2CH(Bneo)OCb. A conjugated cyclohexenylidene and a model diene representing the C5&#8208;C12 domain of cytotoxin callystatin A, were similarly elaborated in a stereochemically programmed manner. The configuration of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkene within the Li&#8208;carbenoid was preserved in the diene product and the newly generated trisubstituted alkene component of the diene could be selectively installed in either (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;configuration by variation in carbenoid stereochemical pairing (like or unlike) and/or the mode of the elimination stage (syn or anti).

A reliable methodology for constructing 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is developed. A vast library of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks were obtained in a multigram scale (up to 302&#8197;g) though the convergent synthetic strategy. This class of compounds was designed for medicinal chemistry as fluorine&#8208;labelled conformationally restricted isosteres of cyclohexane framework. The structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction study, and the physico&#8208;chemical properties (acidity, lipophilicity and water solubility) were characterized. Finally, the generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software showed that the monofluorinated spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks demonstrated the highest propensity to populate the lead&#8208;like chemical space as compared to non&#8208; and difluorinated counterparts, as well as cyclohexane derivatives, while retaining similar three&#8208;dimensionality features.

The Front Cover shows a monofluorinated spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; A promising chemotype for medicinal chemistry. The picture highlights its most interesting feature, which is axial chirality. To achieve this, the background photo has been made by putting the molecular model in front of a mirror. Additional features of the title scaffold are revealed, i.e., lower lipophilicity and a higher propensity to generate lead&#8208;like chemical space as compared to non&#8208; or difluorinated analogs. The authors thank Mr. Bohdan V. Vashchenko for his invaluable help with the artwork preparation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by O. O. Grygorenko et&#8197;al.

The application of Mn&#8208;catalyzed radical Brook rearrangement of fluorinated organosilicon reagents in the synthesis of 1&#8208;trifluoromethyl and 1&#8208;difluoromethyl 1,4&#8208;diktones have been disclosed for the first time. The potential of this advance have been highlighted by the transformation of the products to biologically important fluoroalkylated heterocycles.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first and simple one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step process to the synthesis of 1&#8208;difluoromethyl 1,4&#8208;diketones, through Mn&#8208;catalyzed radical Brook rearrangement. The methodology is also amenable to the synthesis of 1&#8208;trifluoromethyl 1,4&#8208;diketones. The products are efficiently converted to fluoroalkyl substituted furans, thiophenes, pyrroles and pyridazines, which are important structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals.

A Negishi coupling approach offers an alternative approach to tri(cycloalkyl)aryl&#8208;substituted CPAs. Combined with an improved Kumada coupling, this approach allows access to emerging highly selective and novel CPA catalysts. The applicability of the route is demonstrated by preparation of three different tri(cycloalkyl)aryl&#8208;substituted CPAs and the utility of these catalysts in exemplified in representative asymmetric protonation reactions.







Abstract
An alternative synthesis of cycloalkyl&#8208;substituted CPA catalysts is reported. A Negishi coupling offers improved yields and purity of the necessary 1,3,5&#8208;tri(cycloalkyl)benzenes. Limitations in the use of commercial organozinc reagents have been identified and a robust procedure for the preparation of these reagents is detailed. Similarly, a robust procedure for the key Kumada coupling is also provided. The route is demonstrated by preparation of three different tri(cycloalkyl)aryl&#8208;substituted CPAs and the utility of these catalysts in asymmetric protonation reactions is shown.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Additive&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Ethoxycarbonylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Diethyl Dicarbonate as a CO Surrogate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 4938-4942, September 21, 2021. </description>

An additive&#8208;free ethoxycarbonylation of indoles and arylpyridines with diethyl dicarbonate has been developed as a CO&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol. In this reaction, stable and commercially available diethyl dicarbonate serves as a practical alkoxycarbonyl source, and only ethanol and CO2 were produced as byproducts. The utility of this protocol was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of the ethyl ester moiety.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H ethoxycarbonylation of indoles and arylpyridines using diethyl dicarbonate was developed. The catalytic process features an additive&#8208;free ethoxycarbonylation reaction, in which only ethanol and CO2 are produced as byproducts, providing a CO&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol. The introduced ethoxycarbonyl group is easily transformed into other ester and amide functionalities in a single step. Moreover, the reaction can be successfully applied on gram scale, and allows for the efficient synthesis of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters and isophthalates.

In this reaction, stable and commercially available diethyl dicarbonate serves as a practical alkoxycarbonyl source, and only ethanol and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were produced as byproducts. The utility of this protocol was demonstrated by a gram-scale reaction and the transformation of the ethyl ester moiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rhodium-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H ethoxycarbonylation of indoles and arylpyridines using diethyl dicarbonate was developed. The catalytic process features an additive-free ethoxycarbonylation reaction, in which only ethanol and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are produced as byproducts, providing a CO-free and operationally simple protocol. The introduced ethoxycarbonyl group is easily transformed into other ester and amide functionalities in a single step. Moreover, the reaction can be successfully applied on gram scale, and allows for the efficient synthesis of indole-2-carboxylic acid esters and isophthalates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of 2&#8208;Halocyclobutanols through Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 35, Page 4958-4967, September 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a new procedure for the preparation of aryl alkyl ketones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by thermal opening of halocyclobutanols. The reaction conditions for the thermal isomerization of cyclobutanols depend on the relative configuration of halohydrins. Based on the experiments performed, we assume that the halocyclobutanols undergo ring contraction to form cyclopropyl ketones, which are isomerized by means of hydrogen halide.







Abstract
The present work describes the preparation of halohydrins from 2&#8208;halocyclobutanones by means of reactions with Grignard reagents at &#8722;78&#8197;&#176;C. We discovered that the prepared cyclobutanols underwent a thermal ring&#8208;opening reaction. Depending on the structure of the starting cyclobutanol, different products were formed. More specifically, 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ol was found to open to &#947;&#8208;substituted butyrophenones. A novel 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative was obtained for indene&#8208;derived cyclobutanols. Based on the outcomes of the performed experiments, a mechanism for the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanols can be proposed.

         <dc:description>As the analogous of indole bicyclic system, benzothiophenes are often overlooked in organic transformation, and synthetic methods developed mostly rely on the acidic protons at C2 or C3 position, known as C&#8211;H functionalization. Complementary to the structural modification of benzothiophenes, C&#8211;S bond cleavage can realize the skeleton reconstruction. Reduction of benzothiophenes always involves the C&#8211;S bond cleavage, especially in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum products. Beyond reductive desulfurization, although C&#8211;S bond cleavage of benzothiophenes has been achieved by diverse methodologies, there is no systematic review on such topic. Herein, transformation of benzothiophenes  via  C&#8211;S bond cleavage in organic synthesis will be presented along with briefly delineated mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective aldol and conjugate addition reactions mediated by proline&#8208;based catalysts and its analogues: A concise review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of amino acids and small peptides as asymmetric organocatalysts in the aldol and conjugate addition reactions is a major breakthrough in past decade. The desired stereoselectivity in these reactions can be attained through tunable elements of diversity present in the amino acids/peptides. On this note, the current review highlights the organocatalytic aldol and conjugate addition by proline or its analogous in the form of amide/peptide derivatives. The wide&#8208;ranging literatures are classified based on the use of single amino acid or peptides as catalyst. The designing of aforementioned amide/amino acid/peptide catalyst including their recent applications are also detailed. Moreover, the analogous catalysts embedding other hetero&#8208;organic functionalities which mimic the catalytic activity of proline in aldol/conjugate additions are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Domino Approaches for Synthesis of Spirooxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones and Spirooxothiolane&#8208;2&#8208;imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the reactivity of ambident nucleophiles, nitrogen and sulfur as in an isothiocyanate by fine tuning the reaction parameters is a challenge in organic synthesis. A one pot multi&#8208;component protocol is described herein as an approach for construction of spirooxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones and spirooxothiolane&#8208;2&#8208;imines. In DBU mediated reaction, isatin, phenyl acetylenes, and aryl isothiocyanates undergo hydrothiolation whereas aliphatic isothiocyanates undergo hydroamination. In presence of strong base (NaOH) isothiocyanates yield exclusively hydrothiolation. This domino approach proceeds by the addition and 5&#8208;  exo dig  cyclization  via  hydroamination/hydrothiolation, involves consecutive C&#8208;C, C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N/ C&#8208;S bond formations, further corroborated by DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Compounds Combining a Macrocyclic Building Block and Flexible Side&#8208;Arms as Carbohydrate Receptors: Syntheses and Structure&#8208;Binding Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies with compounds consisting of a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms revealed the essential role of the side&#8208;arms in achieving strong complexation of all&#8208;equatorial substituted sugars, such as &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside.







Abstract
A series of new representatives of compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms were prepared and their ability to act as carbohydrate receptors evaluated. The target compounds were obtained by multi&#8208;step syntheses, which included the preparation of numerous precursors as well as the isolation of a large number of by&#8208;products. The structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies comprise, in particular, the variation of the side&#8208;arms in order to demonstrate the importance of the presence of a hydrogen bond donor in these units for the effective complexation of carbohydrates. Based on the findings of our previous studies, the variation of the bridge units is limited to benzene&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;based moieties, whereby the use of the last&#8208;mentioned bridge type was expected to produce more effective systems. This assumption was confirmed by 1H NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis Accelerated via Self&#8208;Assembled Minimal Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling minimalistic peptides embedded with an organocatalytic moiety were designed and tested in a Michael reaction as a proof of concept for accelerated organocatalysis.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling minimalistic peptides embedded with an organocatalytic moiety were designed. By controlling the formation of fibrils via external intervention, it was shown that the activation is accelerated when the organocatalyst is in its supramolecular state. The effect of the accelerated catalysis was demonstrated in a Michael benchmark reaction.

         <title>Applications Of Purine Ring Opening In The Synthesis Of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, And New Purine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the essence of purine ring opening pathways. Electrophilic activation of purine by pulling its electron density from N(1) or N(7) and subsequent nucleophile attack ensures the ring&#8208;opening of the pyrimidine or imidazole part of the parent heterocycle. The obtained products can be used as such or submitted to further rearrangements and cyclizations. This methodology is a useful addition to the synthetic toolbox of heterocyclic chemistry. More information can be found in the Review by I. Novosjolova, M. Turks et&#8197;al.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Diaminoxylosides via Iodosulfonamidation of Xylal Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of iodosulfonamidation of glycals was used for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diaminoxylosides, which are of interest as conformational switches. The synthetic pathway proceeds from an l&#8208;arabino configuration over a glycal with two stereocenters in a threo relation to the d&#8208;xylo configuration of the product with compelling selectivity.







Abstract
d&#8208;Xylose is a special monosaccharide found in various organisms, which is characterized by conformational dynamics between different pyranose ring forms depending on the substitution pattern. With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4&#8208;bromophenyl 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xyloside from l&#8208;arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.

With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4-diamino-xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4-bromophenyl 2,4-diamino-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(4-bromophenyl)-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-xyloside from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an underrepresented buckybowl is described, including a description of its potent reactivities. The key to success is to readily prepare a tetra&#8208;brominated and highly&#8208;distorted precursor of dibenzo[g,p]chrysenes. The precursor undertook intra&#8208;molecular cyclization to form double pentagons, giving a gram&#8208;scale buckybowl skeleton, namely diindeno(1,2,3,4&#8208;defg:1&#8217;,2&#8217;,3&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8208;mnop)chrysene.







Abstract
Preparative synthesis of a new, soluble, and functionalized buckybowl is described. The precursor of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene having four bromine atoms at two fjord regions undertook palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to afford a skeletal buckybowl, namely, diindeno(1,2,3,4&#8208;defg:1&#8217;,2&#8217;,3&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8208;mnop)chrysene. The resulting curved scaffold possesses two important substituents: four&#8208;fold alkyls increasing solubility and four&#8208;fold methoxy groups that could be further functionalized. These two features, coupled with the gently curved &#960;&#8208;system, enable general access to solution&#8208;compatible and multi&#8208;functional buckybowl molecules.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Norbornadienes via in&#8197;situ Cracking of Dicyclopentadiene Using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of norbornadienes (NBDs) was achieved using flow chemistry via a combination of two reactions in one step. In situ cracking of dicyclopentadiene followed by Diels Alder reaction with alkynes in a flow chemistry setup with back&#8208;pressure regulator (BPR) make larger quantities of the norbornadienes (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch pair accessible.







Abstract
The norbornadiene (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch has recently attracted attention due to its use in molecular solar thermal energy systems (MOST). Normally for device testing, several grams are needed. One way of synthesizing NBDs efficiently is through the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between alkynes and cyclopentadiene. However, scaling up the reaction can be troublesome in a research lab environment. Also, dicyclopentadiene needs cracking before utilization which is a time&#8208;consuming step. Here, we developed a method where we both scale up the synthesis in a single reaction step that involves both in&#8197;situ cracking of dicyclopentadiene and the direct reaction of cyclopentadiene with acetylene derivatives using a tubular coiled stainless steel flow reactor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized six different NBD compounds and scaled the synthesis to produce 87&#8197;g of a novel NBD in 9&#8197;h. The NBD is further characterized, showing promising properties for MOST applications. Our new method shows that flow chemistry is an attractive technique for the fast and efficient synthesis of large quantities of NBDs, needed to develop future real&#8208;life devices and applications.

         <dc:description>A new procedure for the synthesis of aryl methyl sulfides from dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and arylsulfonyl chlorides has been achieved. In this strategy, DMC plays dual role as both C1 building block and green solvent. Arylsulfonyl chlorides served as the sulfur precursors, and a variety of aryl methyl sulfides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. Additionally, alkylsulfonyl chloride and dibenzyl carbonate are proven to be suitable substrates as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiochemical Effects on the Carbohydrate Binding and Selectivity of Flexible Synthetic Carbohydrate Receptors with Indole and Quinoline Heterocyclic Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) that bind cell&#8208;surface carbohydrates could be used for disease detection, drug&#8208;delivery, and therapeutics, or for the site&#8208;selective modification of complex carbohydrates but their potential has not been realized because of remaining challenges associated with binding affinity and substrate selectivity. We have reported recently a series of flexible SCRs based upon a biaryl core with four pendant heterocyclic groups that bind glycans selectively through noncovalent interactions. Here we continue to explore the role of heterocycles on substrate selectivity by expanding our library to include a series of indole and quinoline heterocycles that vary in their regiochemistry of attachment to the biaryl core. The binding of these SCRs to a series of biologically&#8208;relevant carbohydrates was studied by 1H NMR titrations in CD2Cl2 and density&#8208;functional theory calculations. We find SCR030, SCR034 and SCR037 are selective, SCR031, SCR032, and SCR039 are strong binders, and SCR033, SCR035, SCR036, and SCR038 are promiscuous and bind weakly. Computational analysis reveals the importance of C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; and H&#8208;bonding interactions in defining the binding properties of these new receptors. By combining these data with those obtained from our previous studies on this class of flexible SCRs, we develop a series of design rules that account for the binding of all SCRs of this class and anticipate the binding of future, not&#8208;yet imagined tetrapodal SCRs.</dc:description>

         <title>How Lewis Acids Catalyze Ene Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic effect of various Lewis acids (LAs) on the ene reaction between propene (ene) and but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one (enophile) was studied quantum chemically using density functional theory and with coupled&#8208;cluster theory. The studied LAs efficiently accelerate the ene reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 12 kcal mol &#8211;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that coordination of a LA catalyst to the enophile decreases the reaction barrier of the ene reaction by inducing an asymmetry in the &#960;&#8208;electronic system, which increases the asynchronicity and hence relieves the otherwise highly destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled p&#8208;orbitals of the ene and enophile. In all, these findings further demonstrate the generality of the Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mannich reaction of  &#945;  &#8208;acetoxy&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters with isatin imine has been developed. The quinine thiourea organocatalyst smoothly promoted the asymmetric Mannich reaction to furnish various 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;aminooxindole derivatives bearing two adjacent tetra&#8208;substituted stereocenters in up to 93% yield, up to 98%  ee  with &gt;20:1  dr  . The transition state structure and absolute configuration of the obtained product has been predicted using DFT calculations and results from single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis are in agreement with the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Synthesis of Thiosulfonates and Thiocyanates: Novel Reactivity of KXCN (X = S, Se) Towards Organosulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient chemoselective protocol has been developed for the synthesis of thiosulfonates and thiocyanates by employing cost effective and commercially available organosulfonyl chlorides with potassium thio&#8208;/selenocyanate. The strategy offered the thiosulfonates and thiocyanates selectively by tuning the equivalents of KSeCN and optimizing the reaction temperature. On the other hand, thiosulfonates were obtained as sole products when organosulfonyl chlorides treated with KSCN. Furthermore, synthesis of diarylthioethers and aryl(heteroaryl) thioethers were carried out as a part of synthetic application of newly prepared arylthiocyanates.</dc:description>

         <title>A comprehensive study of the Ca2+ ion binding of fluorescently labelled BAPTA analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its development, the ionophore BAPTA (1,2&#8209;bis(2&#8209;aminophenoxy)&#8208;ethane&#8209;N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8209;tetraacetic&#160;acid) has been used unchanged in calcium sensing applications. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of novel alterations in the structure of BAPTA, with a focus on the systematic modification of the chain connecting the two aromatic rings of the molecule (denoted as &#8220;linker&#8221;). A bis&#8208;(diethylamino)xantene fluorophore was also attached to the structures in a fixed position and the structure&#8208;fluorescence response relationship of these molecules was investigated in addition. The effect of the length of the linker, the number of O atoms in this chain and even the removal of one of the rings was tested; these all proved to significantly alter the characteristics of the compounds. For example, it was found that the second aromatic ring of BAPTA is not essential for the turn&#8208;on of the fluorescence. We also demonstrated that successful sensing can be realized even by replacing the chain with a single oxygen atom, which suggests the availability of a new calcium binding mode of the chelator. The reliable turn&#8208;on characteristic, the steep Ca  2+  fluorescence titration curve and the intense fluorescence emission combine to make this compound a prospective candidate as a calcium sensing molecular probe in diagnostic neurobiological applications.</dc:description>

Recoverable hybrid materials for heterogeneous enantioselective organocatalyzed Michael addition reaction. Developed through the ready intercalation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dipeptides into reconstructed hydrotalcite (Mg/Al) by means of sustainable technics such as mechanochemical and ultrasound activation.

Abstract
In this work, a series of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (L&#8208;Phe, D&#8208;Phe, L&#8208;Trp) and several &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dipeptides (H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH and H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Leu&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH) intercalated into hydrotalcite (Mg/Al, x=0.333) were prepared by high speed ball milling (HSBM) assisted rehydration/reconstruction methods, followed by sonication and mechanical stirring. All organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid samples were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR&#8208;ATR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the resulting hydrotalcite&#8208;supported materials (natural and hybrid) was evaluated in the asymmetric Michael addition reaction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;aldehydes to N&#8208;substituted&#8208;maleimides. Pristine (HTS), calcined (HTC) and water&#8208;reconstructed (HTR&#8208;l) hydrotalcite&#8208;derived materials exhibited very low catalytic activities, affording racemic mixtures of the anticipated Michael adduct. By contrast, hybrid materials showed better activities, especially HTR&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid catalysts afforded Michael products in up to 94&#8201;% yield and with rather high enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) at room temperature under neat reaction conditions. The effect of solvents and Br&#248;nsted basic or acidic additives was evaluated using the best hybrid catalyst, HTR&#8208;L&#8208;Phe. In addition, recycling and reuse of the catalyst (up to 4 cycles) and large&#8208;scale experiments was successfully carried out.

         <title>The step&#8208;wise synthesis of oligomeric phosphoramidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the step&#8208;wise synthesis to a series of higher phosphoramidates was explored, affording compounds containing N&#8208;P&#8208;N, symmetric and asymmetric P&#8208;N&#8208;P and P&#8208;N&#8208;P&#8208;N&#8208;P linkages. Salt elimination and lithiation strategies were employed to create the new P&#8208;N bonds. It was found that the steric bulk and electronic contribution of the substituents on the P(V) centres were important factors to the success of the reactions. The oligomeric phosphoramidates were characterised by multinuclear NMR, IR spectroscopy as well as ESI mass spectrometry. A selection of the synthesised P&#8208;N oligomers were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against E.coli, S.aureus, C.albicans and A.fumigatus at varying concentrations. The results suggest their potential use as environmentally friendly fire retardants as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for all the compounds was found to be &gt; 128 &#181;M, indicating that the compounds do not have any detectable antimicrobial activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium Chloride&#8208;Promoted Rapid Synthesis of Monosubstituted Ureas under Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monosubstituted ureas are important scaffolds in organic chemistry. They appear in various biologically active compounds and serve as versatile precursors in synthesis. Monosubstituted ureas were originally prepared using toxic and hazardous phosgene equivalents. Modern methods include transamidation of urea and nucleophilic addition to cyanate salts, both of which suffer from a narrow substrate scope due to the need for a strong acid and prolonged reaction times. We hereby report that ammonium chloride can promote the reaction between amines and potassium cyanate to generate monosubstituted ureas in water. This method proceeds rapidly under microwave irradiation and tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Unlike previous strategies, it is compatible with other nucleophiles, acid&#8208;labile moieties and most of the common protecting groups. The products precipitate out of solution, allowing facile isolation without column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging building blocks for medicinal chemistry: recent synthetic advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current medicinal chemistry relies heavily on the quality of building blocks, i.e. reagents used to introduce chemical diversity into the target molecules. The last decade witnessed an emergence of many novel (or well&#8208;overlooked old) chemotypes for drug discovery, which is related to adapting new synthetic methodologies, designing new  sp3&#8208;enriched bioisosteres, paying attention to previously underrated (or even unwanted) structural motifs, or combination thereof. In this review with 532 references, a survey of selected chemotypes that emerged recently in medicinal chemistry is provided, with a focus on the synthesis of the corresponding building blocks. Thus, saturated (hetero)aliphatic boronates, sulfonyl fluorides, sulfinates, non&#8208;classical  sp3&#8208;enriched benzene isosteres, bicyclic morpholine/piperidine/piperazine analogs, as well as  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes (as an example of emerging fluorinated motifs) are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins through Conjugate Addition of Organozinc Reagents: An Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the efficient reactions related to alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins through the conjugate addition of organozinc reagents, including their advantages, limitations, and possibilities for improvement. Both asymmetric and non&#8208;asymmetric conjugate additions are highlighted. Cyclic and acyclic enones, enals, &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes have been used as electron&#8208;deficient olefins.







Abstract
This review focuses on the applications of organozinc reagents in conjugate addition reactions. Organozinc compounds are a class of organometallic reagent used in various reactions such as addition, substitution, and coupling reactions. The conjugate addition or 1, 4&#8208;addition is one of the most useful bond forming strategies used in organic synthesis since broad range of nucleophiles can be employed in the reaction. Addition of organozinc to electron&#8208;deficient olefins attracts synthetic chemists as it preferably undergoes conjugate addition over 1,2&#8208;addition unlike other organometallic reagents, such as Grignard reagent or organolithium. Many natural products were also synthesized by applying the conjugate addition reaction of organozinc. Moreover, organozinc reagents have superior functional group compatibility and can be easily prepared relative to other organometallic compounds. Consequently, conjugate additions of organozinc reagents were highly studied and having a review on it is very important at present. Though a few reviews are available, they either do not focus directly on the organozinc reagents or not on the conjugate addition. We hope that this review article will be of great use to organic researchers.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Glyoxylic Acid Esters: A More Sustainable Approach to Mandelic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of C&#8208;C&#8208;bonds constitutes one of the most fundamental synthetic operations in organic chemistry. The nucleophilic addition of preformed organometallic reagents to an electrophilic carbonyl functionality represents a classical method for the selective construction of a C&#8208;C&#8208;bond. However, the synthesis and utilization of an organometallic reagent is associated with an unfavorable environmental profile. Herein, we disclose a Palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;addition of carboxylic acids to glyoxylic acid esters. This novel method provides access to the mandelic acid scaffold in good yields. Easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and readily available benzoic acids are utilized as more sustainable alternative to preformed organometallic nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridines through Catalytic C&#8722;C Bond Formations from C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the recent developments in the preparation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines by C&#8722;H bond dimerization of pyridines, C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridines, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of 2,2&#8208;pyridine scaffolds.







Abstract
The present review describes the homogenous catalytic methodologies for the synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines involving C&#8722;C bond formation from C&#8722;H bond. There are three main approaches to build well&#8208;decorated 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines from C&#8722;H bond cleavage: i) the formation of C2&#8722;C2&#8242; bond by the dimerization of (activated) pyridines, ii) the C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridine, or iii) the late&#8208;stage functionalization of (activated) 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines including photoredox processes.

     alt="Synthesis of 2,2&#8217;-Bipyridines through Catalytic C&#8722;C Bond Formations from C&#8722;H Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Minireview describes the recent developments in the preparation of 2,2&#8217;-bipyridines by C&#8722;H bond dimerization of pyridines, C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridines, and late-stage functionalization of 2,2-pyridine scaffolds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present review describes the homogenous catalytic methodologies for the synthesis of 2,2&#8217;-bipyridines involving C&#8722;C bond formation from C&#8722;H bond. There are three main approaches to build well-decorated 2,2&#8217;-bipyridines from C&#8722;H bond cleavage: i) the formation of C2&#8722;C2&#8242; bond by the dimerization of (activated) pyridines, ii) the C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridine, or iii) the late-stage functionalization of (activated) 2,2&#8217;-bipyridines including photoredox processes. Besides the scope and limitation of each methodologies, the relevant mechanisms of reaction are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The regioselective  anti  &#8208;dichlorination and allylic chlorination of isolated double bonds is described using a combination of methyl phenyl sulfoxide and TMSCl. The method has been appropriately adjusted to fit the continuous flow technology requirements, aiming to a broader industrial implementation in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds. Towards the same direction, a catalytic protocol has been developed, using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of sulfoxide and environmentally friendly H  2  O  2  as the stoichiometric oxidant, with comparable efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Confused Pyritriphyrin: A New Class of Triphyrin and its Calixphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin(3.3.1) was synthesized by switching the bonding mode of subpyriporphyrin with inclusion of two o &#8208;phenylene rings in the macrocyclic core and prevails nonaromatic character due to the local aromatic characteristic of the embedded 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyridyl unit. The simplest contracted derivative of N&#8208;confused pyricalixphyrin such as calix[2]phyrin(2.2. 1.1.1 ) is mainly achieved; (a) along with N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin; (b) by changing the reaction condition and (c) from N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin by using simple reducing agent. The conversion of N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin to respective calixphyrin analogue was elusive so far. The molecular structure of calixphyrin is unambiguously confirmed by crystal analysis which reveals its partial ruffled conformation with exclusively amine pyrrole units in the macrocyclic core in spite of steric congestion, which is unprecedented to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Indigo&#160;Z&#8208;isomer via Intramolecular Associations of Redox&#8208;Active Appendages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable small molecules, such as  N  ,  N'&#8208;  disubstituted indigos, have received great interest within fields such as pharmacology, energy storage, and functional materials, as they represent key building blocks for reversible and non&#8208;invasive control of chemical processes. However, to ensure applicability of photochromic systems it is of paramount importance to manipulate the photostationary state. In this work, we achieved this by tethering two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units to an  N  ,  N'  &#8208;disubstituted indigo photoswitch. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, we observe significantly enhanced stability of the  Z  &#8208;isomer, compared to the neutral compound, illustrated by a substantial increase in the half&#8208;life from 0.48 seconds to 22 hours. This remarkable stabilization is ascribed to formation of strong, intramolecular pi&#8208;dimers between the oxidized subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes with Pyrrole, Pyrrolone, Pyridinone, Iminofuran, and Pyranone Fragments Embedded on the Rim of the Orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;cage fullerene with a keto&#8208;lactone moiety reacted with aniline to form open&#8208;cage fullerenes with various functional groups on the rim of the expanded orifice. Decarbonylation and decarboxylation process took place under milder conditions compared to those for classical organic compounds. One water molecule could be trapped in the cavity of the new open&#8208;cage compounds as revealed by NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with a pyranone and a diiminopentanone moiety was prepared. Further reaction with aniline could convert the pyranone moiety into a pyrrole moiety through the pyridinone moiety as an intermediate. During the process, decarboxylation and dehydroxylation aromatization reactions also took place on the diiminopentanone moiety and the two adjacent hydroxyl groups, thus forming iminofuran or pyrrolone moiety on the rim of the open&#8208;cage fullerene. Protonation experiment showed that the imino nitrogen atom on the rim of the orifice is more basic than the pyrrole nitrogen atom. The lone pair of the pyrrole nitrogen is partially conjugated with the &#960; system of the fullerene cage as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted Substitution in the Ferrocene Series: Smooth Approach towards Original Catalysts**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution promoted by fluorinated solvent from various iodoferrocenes is described. These new reaction conditions allow the fast generation of libraries of derivatives for applications in catalysis for example, as demonstrated with the synthesis of original ligands used in cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution is an important reaction in the ferrocene series, especially to obtain ligands for catalysis. Herein, we described new reactions conditions, using fluorinated alcohols as both solvent and promoter, able to deliver iodoferrocene derivatives faster than using classical solvents. Various N, O, P and C&#8208;nucleophiles were found compatible with this transformation which occurs with full retention of stereochemistry. Original P,N&#8208;ligands were prepared by using iodine/lithium exchange&#8208;chlorophoshine trapping sequences, and their properties were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling as well as in ketone &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a practical, general protocol for denitration of readily available &#945;&#8208;nitroketones with sulfur and amines to access a broad range of &#945;&#8208;ketothioamides under mild conditions. These mild reactions proceed under metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to provide synthetically useful &#945;&#8208;ketothioamides. Furthermore, the reactions can be carried out with a wide range of substrates especially for the synthesis of aliphatic &#945;&#8208;ketothioamides which are rarely reported.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Seleno&#8208;Glycolipids via the Transacetalization of Selenoacetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. To expand the scope of available seleno&#8208;glycolipids, we established a facile synthesis toward novel mono&#8208; and diseleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties; this proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.







Abstract
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids, in which glycosidic oxygens are replaced with selenium atoms, are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. However, the development of seleno&#8208;glycolipids has been hampered by difficulties associated with their chemical syntheses. In this study, we report a facile synthesis of novel seleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties, which proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work not only provides a route to monoseleno&#8208;glycolipids, but also demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides via Electrochemical Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical, oxidative generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realised. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby the usage of a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were in situ generated via metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiolsulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalisation or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The scope of the reaction was investigated by converting different functionalised aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfonyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl sulfonyl amides are synthesized in a self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and in high yields. Armed and disarmed glycosyl donors of different size and with different protective groups react smoothly with sulfonyl amides, such as protected asparagine derivatives. Influence of solvents, concentration, temperature and stoichiometry is studied.







Abstract
N&#8208;Glycosyl N&#8208;sulfonyl amides have been synthesized by a self&#8208;promoted glycosylation, i.&#8201;e. without any catalysts, promotors or additives. When the reactions were carried out at lower temperatures a mixture of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycosides were observed, where the latter rearranged to give the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides at elevated temperatures. By this method sulfonylated asparagine derivatives can be selectively &#946;&#8208;glycosylated in high yields by trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors of different reactivity including protected glucosamine derivatives. The chemoselectivity in the glycosylations as well as the rearrangements from O&#8208;glycosides to &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides gives information of the glycosylation mechanism. This method gives access to glycosyl sulfonyl amides under mild conditions.

         <title>Applications of Purine Ring Opening in the Synthesis of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, and New Purine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring system of purine is remarkably stable, but can be opened at either side, if properly activated. In this review, purine ring opening reactions leading to imidazole and pyrimidine derivatives are summarized. Purine ring opening is also a powerful tool for the synthesis of new ring&#8208;modified purine derivatives (e.&#8201;g., N1&#8208;labelled analogs) by various rearrangement pathways.







Abstract
Purines, which are regarded as relatively stable heterocyclic systems, can be opened at both pyrimidine and imidazole rings. Purine ring opening also serves as a tool for the preparation of ring&#8208;modified purines through rearrangement/recyclization mechanisms. The obtained imidazole, pyrimidine, and purine derivatives are privileged molecular scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Purine ring&#8208;opening approach is a useful alternative for their synthesis, which competes well with de novo approach or modification of a conserved heterocyclic core. The substitution patterns and groups that activate purines towards ring opening are reviewed. Moreover, mechanistic studies using labelled substrates, which are leading to rearranged purine derivatives are covered. Furthermore, an insight into imidazole ring opening upon exposure of purine system to DNA damaging agents is provided.

         <dc:description>Difluoromethylation is of prime importance for its applicability in functionalizing diverse heterocycle contain fluorine, which are core groups in diverse biological and pharmacological activities. Herein, we report a novel transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free visible light&#8208;photoinduced protocol for direct Csp2&#8211;H difluoromethylation of heterocycle of green approach. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles without colored organic dyes and metal&#8208;catalysts. It was in good yields with a broad substrate tolerance. Moreover, the representative products exhibited the green potential drugs activity, and 2h showed good antifungal activities against Rhizoctorzia solani (62.7%).</dc:description>

A series of dialkyl 2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylates was prepared from (tert&#8208;butyl)iso&#8208;propyl thioketene via Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition with D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. In all studied cases the (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer was found as the main product.







Abstract
The reactivity of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes towards thioketenes was investigated. In a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition using Sc(OTf)3 as a Lewis acidic catalyst, the corresponding exocyclic thioenol ethers (2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophenes) were formed in moderate to good yields. Unsymmetrical thioketenes provided E/Z mixtures at the double bond, with the Z isomer being preferred.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Molecules for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview presents recent examples of mechanically interlocked structures for biological and medical applications. Topics discussed include smart drugs, theranostics, sensing of medically relevant species, as well as protein&#8208; and DNA engineering. Utilizing the unique properties of the mechanical bond to construct functional systems for biomedical applications can serve as a paradigm for further developments in these fields.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) carry great potential in different fields of chemistry, based on their specific structures, their internal dynamics, their stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and other unique features of the mechanical bond. This minireview presents some of the most recent developments in their use for medical and biological applications. For example, they have been used to influence, enhance or block the action of therapeutic agents to enable targeted drug delivery. The dynamic structural properties have been used to generate switches and transporters, as well as sensors for various medically relevant species. Building MIMs by incorporating biomolecules like DNA and proteins has served as a novel way to control their properties.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <dc:description>An eco&#8208;friendly bifunctional alkali&#8208;promoted gold&#8208;based catalyst with redox and basic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenative coupling of anilines to symmetrical and unsymmetrical aromatic azo compounds was developed. We realized a base additives/toxic oxidant&#8208;free, safer, and environmentally friendly process, with reasonable reusability of the catalyst achieved under milder reaction conditions. Notably, the enhanced catalytic activity was also linked to increased basic site concentration, low reduction temperatures, and the effect of lattice oxygen on the nanomaterials. The increased basic strength of the cation&#8208;promoted catalyst improved the electron density of the active Au species, resulting in faster desorption and a higher yield of the desired aromatic azo compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Fully Substituted 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. A final step diversification approach was employed to efficiently introduce various substituents in the 1&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions of the pyrazole. A scalable, multi&#8208;gram synthesis of the lead compound is also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. An efficient, divergent approach to introduce phenyl, phenoxy, phenylsulfanyl, anilino and benzyl substituents in the 4&#8208;position of the pyrazole, alongside a flexible synthesis of N1&#8208;alkyl analogues is described via final step diversification of key intermediates. Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenoxy)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]oxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.

Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2-[4-(2,4-difluorophenoxy)-1,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy-5-fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi-gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Lactams from Cyclic Anhydrides via N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic anhydrides can be readily converted to ring&#8208;contracted lactams after sequential silylazidation, protonolysis, Curtius rearrangement and catalysis of ring closure by DMAP, in an operationally simple procedure. Succinic anhydrides do not form ring&#8208;contracted &#946;&#8208;lactams but instead generate &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides which serve as activated analogues of &#946;&#8208;amino acids of use in &#946;&#8208;peptide and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
The ring contraction&#8208;lactamisation of anhydrides upon reaction with trimethylsilylazide in the presence of an amine catalyst has been studied. Under controlled conditions, 5,&#8208; 6&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered ring lactams can be generated from cyclic anhydrides in an operationally simple procedure. In the case of &#947;&#8208;lactams, the methodology allows for the synthesis of challenging systems incompatible with the usual disconnection involving an amine and an activated carbonyl group. The synthesis of simple larger ring lactams is hampered by inaccessible monomeric cyclic anhydride precursors &#8208; a problem which can be circumvented through rigidification. Succinic anhydrides make N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides of use in polymer chemistry and as &#946;&#8208;peptide precursors.

         <title>Synthesis of Lactams by Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Derivatives with &#969;&#8208;Amino Fatty Acids under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented efficient method for the reductive amination of carbonyl derivatives with &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation conditions was developed leading to the corresponding lactams. A variety of pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, 2&#8208;azepanones were prepared in up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields (29 examples).







Abstract
An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2&#8208;azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance. Notably, no metallic based catalyst was required to perform this transformation.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines are accessible by a reaction sequence consisting of HWE&#8208;reaction, a Z/E&#8208;photoisomerization, and ring closure of the pyridine ring. Bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines can be obtained from 7&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the fused pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8211;Buchwald amination.

         <title>Aryl Fluoroalkyl Sulfoxides: Optical Stability and pKa Measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key properties of chiral aryl fluoroalkyl sulfoxides with strong synthetic potential were studied. After resolution by enantioselective chromatography, their optical stability was investigated by thermal enantiomerization via enantioselective chromatography. Their &#916;G&#8800; values range from 38.2 to 41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the pKa values of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined via indirect UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations in DMSO and are in the range of 20.3&#8211;22.5.







Abstract
The enantiomeric separation of aryl trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl sulfoxides was realized via chiral chromatography. The configurational stability of each set of enantiomers was then studied by thermal enantiomerization. The &#916;G&#8800; values obtained cover a range of 38.2&#8211;41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C, thus demonstrating their optical stability at room temperature. However, a shorter half&#8208;life time has been observed for difluoromethyl sulfoxides. Furthermore, the acidities of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined in DMSO by an overlapping indicator method using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations. The pKa values fall in range of 20.3&#8211;22.5 and differ by about 10&#8197;log units compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.

         <title>A Scalable High&#8208;Yielding and Selective Oxidative Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling &#8211; A Key Step for the Synthesis of trans&#8208;Stilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step synthesis leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene molecular scaffold was successfully designed and performed. In order to carry out this synthetic pathway, a highly selective and high yielding oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized. A trans&#8208;stilbene derivative [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid]] required in a medicinal chemistry project was successfully up&#8208;scaled (&gt;1000&#215;) and exploited for the production of the substance on a multi&#8208;gram (150&#8197;g) scale.







Abstract
A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted trans&#8208;stilbenes, which revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#8197;g (&gt;1000&#215;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73&#8201;% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90&#8201;%. The inhibitor candidate DC10 [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities (&#8776;33&#8197;g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled&#8208;up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on &gt;100&#8208;gram scale.

     alt="A Scalable High-Yielding and Selective Oxidative Heck Cross-Coupling &#8211; A Key Step for the Synthesis of trans-Stilbenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-step synthesis leading to the &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;stilbene molecular scaffold was successfully designed and performed. In order to carry out this synthetic pathway, a highly selective and high yielding oxidative Heck cross-coupling method was developed and optimized. A &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;stilbene derivative [(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-5-(2-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl)vinyl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid]] required in a medicinal chemistry project was successfully up-scaled (&amp;gt;1000&#215;) and exploited for the production of the substance on a multi-gram (150&#8197;g) scale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selective oxidative Heck cross-coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross-coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;stilbenes, which revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled-up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#8197;g (&amp;gt;1000&#215;up-scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73&#8201;% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90&#8201;%. The inhibitor candidate &lt;b&gt;DC10&lt;/b&gt; [(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-5-(2-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl)vinyl)-2-hydroxy-benzoic acid] was produced in multi-gram quantities (&#8776;33&#8197;g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled-up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross-coupling on &amp;gt;100-gram scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Achieving control over the diastereoselectivity of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to obtain maximum number of diastereomers under simple operation is an enduring challenge. In this work, the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides was studied experimentally and theoretically. The reaction produced pyrrolidines (endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts under Ag(I) and Cu(II) catalysis respectively) with four contiguous stereogenic centers bearing a fluorinated quaternary stereogenic center at C4.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides has been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion: in contrast to our previous results where exo&#8208;adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the endo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free&#8208;energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind endo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Azaphilone pigments from Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H.&#160;texense: absolute configuration, bioactivity, and biosynthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new stromatal azaphilone pigments rubiginosins D&#8722;F from the ascomycete  Hypoxylon rubiginosum  , and rubiginosins D and G from  H.&#160;texense  , along with known monomeric and dimeric congeners. Structures were elucidated using comprehensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis, revealing azaphilones from both fungi to be exclusively C&#8209;8(  S  )&#8208;configured. The orsellinic acid (OA)&#8208;carrying rubiginosins A, D and dimeric rutilins A&#8722;B exhibited cytotoxicity, while rubiginosins F&#8722;G bearing linear polyketide side chains and rutilins A&#8722;B were antimicrobial. Structures of the differently&#8208;substituted azaphilones were linked to two putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs;  hraza1  /  2  ) in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  , which are proposed to collaboratively synthesize the OA&#8208;substituted azaphilones. These share high homology with the azaphilone&#8208;forming BGCs  hfaza1  /  2  from  H.&#160;fragiforme  . Comparison of  hraza  and  hfaza  suggests that lack of an FAD&#8208;dependent monooxygenase and acyltransferase gene in  hraza1  prevent formation of C&#8208;8(  R  )&#8208;configured fatty acid&#8208;substituted azaphilones in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  . The polyketide synthase&#8208;derived side chain of rubiginosins C and F&#8722;G is not encoded in the respective BGCs, showing that a third BGC is hypothetically involved in their formation. Cross&#8208;interaction of three BGCs forming a single molecule is unprecedented in fungal natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

A robust gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of novel 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane building blocks as fluorinated 2,4&#8208;methanoproline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
