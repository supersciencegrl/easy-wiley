         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Biogenic CuO Nanoparticles from Agrowaste for One&#8208;Pot C&#63743;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuONPs exhibiting excellent catalytic activity are developed following a green and sustainable approach, transforming agrowaste material into wealth. The reusable nanostructure effectively catalyzed the C&#63743;N bond&#8208;forming reactions, facilitating the aza&#8208;Michael addition and the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives offering excellent yields, wide substrate scope, and hassle&#8208;free route.

A simple, green, and cost&#8208;effective method is reported for the synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) using waste cotton shell (WCS) ash extract, which serves as a natural base (pH 12), replacing conventional inorganic bases. The green&#8208;synthesized CuONPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity in heterogenous catalysis facilitating C&#63743;N bond formation, a key strategy for accessing various bioactive nitrogen heterocycles. TEM analysis reveals spherical morphology of the CuO nanostructure with an average particle size of 15.5&#8201;nm. The catalyst efficiently promotes the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives via cyclization of terminal alkynes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, offering broad substrate scope (17 quinoxaline derivatives), good yields, and recyclability. This methodology is also applicable to aliphatic terminal alkynes. Additionally, CuONPs also catalyzed the aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions of amines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds at room temperature, affording excellent yields. The protocol tolerates a wide range of amines, including acyclic, cyclic (up to seven&#8208;membered rings), primary, secondary, and heterocyclic amines. Synthesis of 14 aza&#8208;Michael addition products is reported. Furthermore, the CuO nanostructures exhibit high stability and reusability for up to five cycles with minimal loss of activity.

         <title>[3]Radialene Fluorophores with pH&#8208;Switchable Emission and Stable Absorption Maxima</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of the first push&#8211;pull quino [3]radialene fluorophore are reported, integrating a bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene acceptor with a benzimidazole donor. It exhibits minimal solvatochromism, and vibronic coupling of the [3]radialene motif dominates the emission properties. Upon protonation, the fluorescence quantum yield rises from 22% to 71%, with a significant redshift.

The first push&#8211;pull quino [3]radialene fluorescent dye is reported. Herein, the novel bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene electron acceptor is connected to a benzimidazole donor. With protonation, a substantial redshift of fluorescence wavelength is observed, while the absorption maximum remains stable. This process is accompanied with an increased fluorescence quantum yield to about 70%. Further, the findings are explained by a combined experimental and theoretical approach, and it is found that vibronic coupling plays a crucial role. This study highlights the yet unexplored potential of [3]radialene&#8208;based motifs for the design of environment&#8208;responsive fluorophores.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous micellar media have emerged as sustainable alternatives to organic solvents for small&#8208;molecule synthesis. This Review discusses the evolution of surfactants for synthesis, their application to cross&#8208;coupling reactions, the benefits for reactivity and sustainability, and the remaining challenges in this rapidly growing field.

Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance toward toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarizes recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.

         <title>Tuning Glycosyl Donor Reactivity via Nitroarene Protecting Groups: A Semiarmed Strategy for Selective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy reports to tune glycosyl donor reactivity using nitroarene protecting groups. These groups suppress donor reactivity and can be chemically converted into activating groups, enabling a switchable system. This approach broadens the armed&#8211;disarmed glycosylation strategy and allows for efficient, selective oligosaccharide synthesis using precisely controlled donor reactivity.

Herein, a modular strategy for tuning the reactivity of glycosyl donors using nitroarene (NA) protecting groups such as 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl, 4&#8208;nitrobenzoyl, and 4&#8208;nitrophenyl. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the nitro group markedly reduces donor reactivity, enabling selective activation. Notably, these NA groups can be readily transform into electron&#8208;donating pivaloylaminoarene (PA) and methoxycarbonylaminoarene (MCA) groups via nitro reduction followed by acylation or carbamation. This chemical conversion significantly enhances donor reactivity, offering a switchable reactivity platform. Relative reactivity values (RRVs), determined through competitive glycosylation, establish the reactivity trend: NA &lt; arene &lt; PA &lt; MCA. Applying this strategy, an efficient synthesis of a series of disaccharides is achieved, demonstrating its utility in extending the conventional armed&#8211;disarmed approach in glycosylation chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation of Allenoates with 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclic compounds are key scaffolds in many drugs and other bioactive molecules. While cyclopropanation of allenes is relatively straightforward, synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from these substrates is scarce. We report a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of allenoates with oxadiazolines as carbene precursors . Thioxanthone, serving as an energy transfer catalyst, enables mild reaction conditions and short reaction times.

Spirocyclic compounds are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are important components of numerous drugs and other bioactive molecules. Although the cyclopropanation of allenes using typical methods is relatively straightforward, only limited approaches for the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from allenoates have been reported. Herein, a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of these substrates using oxadiazolines as a source of nucleophilic carbenes is described. The application of thioxanthone as an energy transfer catalyst under violet light irradiation enables the formation of alkylidenecyclopropanes in synthetically useful yields.

         <title>Adding &#8220;Energy&#8221; to Chalcogenophene Chemistry: Electrosynthesis of 2,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Selenyl&#8208;Chalcogenophenes and Their Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrosynthetic method is developed for synthesizing selenyl&#8208;chalcogenophenes via intramolecular cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenenynes under mild conditions and without external oxidants. Density functional theory calculations and cyclic voltammetry support the experimental results and help propose plausible mechanistic pathways.

Herein, an efficient and more environmentally benign electrosynthetic approach is reported for the intramolecular chalcogeno cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenynes, resulting in seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene derivatives. The reaction proceeds in an undivided cell in constant current and equipped with platinum electrodes by using 5&#8201;mL of acetonitrile as a solvent, 0.2&#8201;mmol of the (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenyne, 2 equiv. of diorganoyl diselenide and 0.2 equiv. of electrolyte, 18 overall compounds are synthesized with yields between 52% and 97%. Control experiments and density functional theory studies are also conducted to propose plausible mechanistic pathways. Furthermore, selected compounds are screened via spectrophotometric titration to assess their potential interactions with DNA, with results indicating that both groove and intercalation interactions occure depending on the structure and concentration of the seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene compound. This electrochemical procedure presents itself as a viable and cost&#8208;effective alternative for the synthesis of chalcogenophenes, as it doesn't require external oxidants, operates under mild reaction conditions, and affords its products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide&#8208;mediated crucial halogen&#8208;bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.

A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies. Other attractive features, such as inexpensive electrode material and electrolytes, minimal chemical waste, broad substrate scope, consistent yield, operational simplicity, and scalability, make this method appealing.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Topological Variations on the Stability of the Ground Singlet and Lowest&#8208;Lying Triplet States of Catacondensed Hexabenzenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of topological features on the stability of 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids in their ground singlet and lowest&#8208;lying triplet states is investigated using a multivariate regression model. This analysis reveals key structural factors governing stability, providing insights into the design of polybenzene&#8208;based materials.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as tetracenes, pentacenes, hexacenes, and some higher acenes play a central role in organic electronics due to their unique electronic properties. The impact of topological variations on the relative stability of PAH isomers in different electronic states is poorly understood, with limited insights into how Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and topological features such as bay, cove, fjord, and K&#8208;regions influence stability in their ground singlet (S0) and lowest&#8208;lying triplet (T1) states. In this work, density functional theory calculations of the S0 and T1 states of the 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids are performed. A multivariate linear regression model with relative energy as the dependent variable and a series of topological parameters as the independent variables is used to quantify the effect of topology in the relative stability of the catacondensed hexabenzenoids. Analysis shows that, in S0, stability is enhanced by an increase in the number of Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and K&#8208;regions and decreased by the presence of coves and fjords. In T1, the main stabilizing factors are the number of Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and the number of rings involved in the antiaromatic region, whereas topological regions such as K&#8208;edges, bays, coves, or fjords are destabilizing.

         <title>Upcycling Food Waste: Ursolic Acid as Sustainable Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable strategy to access 24 ursane&#8208;type natural products from ursolic acid, derived from apple pomace waste. The method enables short syntheses (1&#8211;12 steps) with high yields (up to 98%). By upcycling food waste into valuable bioactive compounds, this work exemplifies green chemistry and supports circular economy principles in natural product synthesis.

Herein, a sustainable strategy to access the ursane class of natural products is presented. The complexity&#8208;controlling synthesis approach employs ursolic acid&#8212;readily obtained from apple pomace, a waste product of apple juice production&#8212;as sustainable feedstock to access 24 natural products of the ursane family in short synthetic sequences (1&#8211;12 steps) and good yields (up to 98%).

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans by [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] Annulation with Substituted Salicyl N&#8208;Phosphonyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis involving the [4 + 1] annulation of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with a sulfur ylide occurred with tunable diastereoselectivity depending on the cosolvent ratio of THF/EtOH. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission , aggregation&#8208;induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering experiments indicate that the stereocontrol observed in the reaction is due to the formation of chiral aggregates.

The aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis (AIAS) of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran compounds is achieved via the reaction of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with sulfur ylide. This transformation proceeds through a [4&#8201;+&#8201;1] annulation pathway, affording products in good to excellent yields with tunable diastereoselectivities. By employing various THF/EtOH cosolvent systems in conjunction with GAP chemistry, the conventional aggregation cosolvent systems are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing diastereoselectivity and modulating aggregate formation. This is supported by studies involving aggregation&#8208;induced emission, aggregation&#8208;induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering. The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of AIAS as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.

This is supported by studies involving aggregation-induced emission, aggregation-induced polarization, and dynamic light scattering. The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of AIAS as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying the True Catalyst: A Mn(II) Salt versus Mn(II) Complexes in Epoxidation with m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the investigation of the reactivity of three Mn complexes, Mn(ClO4)2 shows higher reactivity toward styrene epoxidation, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese center. Raman spectroscopy provides mechanistic insight: monitoring alkene epoxidation and consumption of the oxidant over time, the true nature of the active catalyst is revealed, and competition reactions are discovered.

The oxidant meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) is used widely for the epoxidation of alkenes, yet its efficiency is often limited under ambient conditions. This study investigates the catalytic activity of a Mn(II) salt and mononuclear Mn(II) complexes, two of which are reported here for the first time, in the epoxidation of alkenes with m&#8208;CPBA under ambient conditions. Time&#8208;resolved Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor substrate conversion, oxidant consumption, and product formation. The data reveal that simple Mn(II) salts exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity than Mn(II) complexes, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese center. The catalytic efficiency of Mn(II) perchlorate is particularly notable, achieving near&#8208;complete oxidation of styrene within minutes under mild conditions. Furthermore, epoxidation of a range of alkenes demonstrates that Mn(II) salts provide broad substrate scope and high selectivity. These findings suggest that simple Mn(II) salts can serve as highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts in alkene epoxidations with m&#8208;CPBA.

Green Approach for Copper&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Using Saponin&#8208;Based Micellar Catalysis in Water at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and sustainable protocol for Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to synthesize internal alkynes using a micellar catalysis system, which is derived from saponin, an inexpensive, biodegradable natural surfactant, at room temperature in aqueous medium has been developed.

A micellar catalysis that is derived from commercially available saponin for copper&#8208;free, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Using this green and sustainable method, a broad range of aryl/heteroaryl and alkyl terminal alkynes are cross&#8208;coupled with aryl/heteroaryl halides at ambient temperature in an aqueous medium. The commercially available, inexpensive, and plant&#8208;based natural saponin serves as a surfactant for a micellar system that effectively enables C(sp2)&#63743;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of substrates. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of water as a reaction medium, the in situ generation of the micellar&#8211;catalysis system from biodegradable natural saponins, good functional group tolerance, scalability of the products, and notably, the ability to retain the catalyst activity by recycling the aqueous reaction medium.

         <title>Toward the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Difluoro Deaminated Sialic Acid (C3DFKDN)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of protected C3&#8208;difluoro KDN (C3DFKDN), an unnatural derivative of the sialic acid member, KDN, and key building block for KDN&#8208;based chemical probes, is reported. Its 12&#8208;step synthetic route starts from commercially available methyl d&#8208;mannopyranoside and key steps include a Reformatsky reaction with ethyl bromodifluoroacetate, alkylation with ethyl vinyl ether, and ozonolysis of a terminal double bond.

2&#8208;Keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;nononic acid (KDN) is a nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharide of the sialic acid family. As a deaminated analogue of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), KDN features a hydroxyl group at C5 instead of an amine. Although present at low levels in mammalian tissues, KDN is abundant in certain tumor cells and pathogens, making it and its processing enzymes attractive targets for understanding biological functions and developing potential therapeutics. Fluorinated carbohydrate derivatives are widely used to probe and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes). This report describes the first total synthesis of 3,3&#8208;difluoro KDN (C3DFKDN), a novel fluorinated sialic acid derivative and a key intermediate for designing covalent inhibitors and activity&#8208;based probes targeting KDN&#8208;processing enzymes. Introduction of a C3&#8208;difluoro group prevents elimination side reactions common with monofluorinated sialic acid analogues. Two synthetic strategies are explored: 1) Coupling a pyranose precursor with a difluorinated alkyne bromide followed by oxidation and 2) incorporation of a difluoroacetate building block via a Reformatsky&#8208;type reaction. The latter approach proves more effective, affording protected C3DFKDN in an overall yield of 3.7% over 12 steps from methyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside. This work establishes methodology for the synthesis of C3&#8208;difluorinated sialic acids and provides a foundation for developing fluorinated probes and inhibitors of KDN&#8208;related enzymatic pathways.

         <title>Decarboxylative Michael Additions of Substituted Malonic Acid Half&#8208;Oxyesters to Methylidene Malonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted malonic acid half oxyesters reacted with alkylidene malonates in a fast, efficient decarboxylative Michael addition, delivering adducts in high yields. The reaction occurred in bulk solvent, open to air, needing only a weak amine base as an organocatalyst to drive a mechanism involving addition prior to decarboxylation.

Decarboxylative Michael additions between substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) and methylidene malonates have been achieved using either a catalytic amount of a weak base such as N&#8208;methyl&#8208;morpholine or di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylamine in a refluxing solvent. This transformation occurs under practical conditions (bulk solvent and open to air) and can be performed with various SMAHOs and methylidene malonates, in yields ranging from 22 to 89%. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), studies support the occurrence of a Michael addition pre&#8208;decarboxylation mechanism.

1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles are synthesized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. Convenient domino and one&#8208;pot sequential methods are also developed.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method is versatile, high yielding, and even suitable for domino and one&#8208;pot sequential protocols, combining the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been successfully developed under ambient conditions by merging Rh(III) catalysis with photoredox catalysis.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been achieved at ambient conditions by merging Rh(III)&#8208;catalysis with photoredox catalysis. Various spirocyclized quinazolinone derivatives are synthesized with a broad substrate scope in up to 92% yields at room temperature. A further mechanistic study involving control experiments, UV spectroscopy, light on&#8208;off experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, H/D labeling study, and hydrogen peroxide detection tests has been explored. The present methodology is demonstrated to be effective for scale&#8208;up synthesis, enabling the efficient generation of the spirocyclic product.

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Synthesis of Dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]Coumarins and Pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]Coumarins</title>

A solvent&#8208;selective divergent approach for construction of trans&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins through a metal&#8208;free oxidative coupling and cyclocondensation is described. In addition, a pathway to furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin is disclosed. Control experiments reveal a radical pathway for oxidative coupling, and density functional theory calculations offer an insight into the preferential formation of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins in MeCN.

This study has developed a chemodivergent protocol for synthesizing furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins from easily accessible reagents through oxidative cyclization and condensation reaction, respectively. A library of dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins and pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins is synthesized by just tuning the reaction conditions. Moreover, furo[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin can be synthesized through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step approach. High chemoselectivity is observed in the case of formation of dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins. Mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, operational simplicity, use of inexpensive catalyst, broad functional group tolerance, and practicability are the important facets of this strategy. Detailed mechanistic investigation indicates the radical pathway for oxidative cyclization. Whereas, theoretical studies show that the greater electrophilicity of the carbonyl group in acetonitrile is responsible for the preferential formation of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]chromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones.

A novel pyridazine&#8208;based organophotocatalyst that enables light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols and E&#8211;Z isomerization of 1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. This sustainable methodology offers efficient transformations under mild conditions, showcasing a green alternative to traditional protocols.

Organic chemistry continues to evolve by discovering and applying novel catalytic systems that enable efficient and selective transformations. Herein, the development and utilization of a newly synthesized organophotocatalyst for C&#63743;H functionalization and isomerization reactions are reported. A pyridazine derivative is successfully used here as a photocatalyst to synthesize 1,3&#8208;oxazines via C&#63743;H functionalizations of Betti bases (&#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols) and for the E&#8211;Z isomerization of 2&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. A tentative mechanism is also proposed for the catalytic behavior of the novel photocatalyst.

         <title>The Novel Radical&#8208;Based Strategies for the Construction of &#945;&#8208;Allenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 30, August 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Allenols play a vital role in organic synthesis as they can undergo a wide range of transformations for the construction of natural products and pharmaceuticals. As compared to the two&#8208;electron transfer ionic pathway, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols by single&#8208;electron transfer under mild conditions with high efficiency and excellent selectivity.

&#945;&#8208;Allenols have become common advanced synthons for the synthesis of various of structures and are a frequent motif in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The special reactivity can occur due to the synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxy functional groups. Thus, many remarkable and elegant protocols have been explored through ionic pathways for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols. Recently, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols through single&#8208;electron transfer. As compared to the ionic pathway, the radical pathway has clear advantages, such as mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent selectivity control. In this review, the most important contributions for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols are summarized via radical intermediates by categorizing them into different types of substrates. Additionally, mechanistic studies and synthetic challenges are highlighted.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper Catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;P Bond Formation by Coupling of Diphenylphosphine with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Ullmann&#8208;type C&#63743;P bond&#8208;forming reaction is accomplished at room temperature with no additional ligand. This method features broad substrate scope, scalability, and product transformation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of diphenylphosphine with aryl halides is reported. This efficient C(sp2)&#63743;P bond formation is realized by blue LED irradiation of a copper(I) catalyst at room temperature with no additional ligand. A variety of sterically demanding and functionalized substrates are applied under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding triarylphosphines in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Two Metals, One Goal: Unlocking Reactivity with Heterobimetallic Systems for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review involves heterobimetallic catalytic systems that provides access to various organic transformations which are obscure with conventional monometallic systems. It throws light on diverse organic reactions such as alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling presented in conherent with their mechanism and catalytic cycle.

The design of heterobimetallic catalysis is redefining the frontiers in organic synthesis by harnessing the combined power of two distinct metals. It maneuvers a powerful platform in advancing organic transformations through leveraging cooperative synergetic effect of bimetals. In this review, this study unveils heterobimetallic systems that unlock challenging bond activations and novel reaction pathways inaccessible to traditional monometallic systems. It highlights key examples across diverse reaction classes of organic transformation paving way for alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling reactions for the synthesis of pharmaceutically and industrially relevant molecules. The review consolidates on the current updates on the reactions, mechanism, catalytic cycle, and their synthetic transformations. Heterobimetallic catalysts deliver amplified reactivity, expanded substrate diversity, and sharpened selectivity profiles. The bimetallic catalytic system orchestrates multielectron redox&#8208;processes, dual&#8208;site activation, and high turnover numbers. The review concludes with a brief outlook on the future scope, offering a blueprint for next&#8208;generation catalytic platforms that push the boundaries of molecular construction.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Isoxazoles and Isoxazolines Directly from Aldehydes via One&#8208;Pot Metal&#8208;Free Approach Using a Reusable Ionic Liquid [C8DABCO][OH] at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a one&#8208;pot and a multistep approach for the regioselective formation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles, isoxazolines, and bis&#8208;isoxazoles at room temperature. The metal&#8208;free method enhances product yield, allowing lower catalyst loading, reduced reaction time, and broad substrate tolerance . Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and reusability of the ionic&#8208;liquid underscore its sustainable advantages, reinforcing the efficiency and eco&#8208;friendliness of the protocol.

Isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives demonstrate versatile therapeutic properties, captivating widespread global attention. Despite the potential benefits of these scaffolds, hurdles such as reliance on cytotoxic and expensive metal catalysts, low productivity, and limited substrate scope impede their effective synthesis. In this work, a 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, based ionic liquid has been developed for the sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions from chloroaldoximes. The room temperature mediated protocol framed the desired 3,5&#8208;disubstituted and 3,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted compounds, tolerating an array of functionalized and substituted chloroaldoximes, alkynes, and olefins. Moreover, this basic catalytic system even formulates the generation of bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives and fabricates a one&#8208;pot telescopic strategy for forming the 3,5&#8208;isomer directly from aldehydes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction done on three of the synthesized compounds confirms the formation of the 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazole and bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives. In addition, formation of some interesting, unusual products other than the desired isoxazole derivatives provides a new insight into this cycloaddition reaction. The reusability of the catalytic system for up to four consecutive runs and the successful outcome of the gram&#8208;scale reactions illustrate the synthetic efficiency of the protocol.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Compounds and Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions are robust synthetic tools to assamble complex polyheterocycles and other interesting molecular architectures with potential application in medicinal chemistry, including their fluorine&#8208;containing analogues. Fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity and metabolic resistance. Indeed, various marketed drugs contain fluorine atoms in their structures.

It is well known that fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic resistance. In the same way, a relatively broad spectrum of marketed drugs contains one or more fluorine atoms in their structures, usually in the form of fluorine&#8208;, difluoromethyl&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208;, or perfluoroalkyl aromatic moieties, being essential parts of their corresponding pharmacophores. Besides, multicomponent reactions (MCR) are highly convergent one&#8208;pot processes in which three or more smartly substituted/functionalized reagents are combined simultaneously, sequentially or consecutively, in the same reactor to assemble complex products (including polyheterocycles) containing most or all atoms from the reagents. Thus, the scope of the present review is to discuss selected MCR&#8208;based works since 2009 for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs that contain at least one fluorine atom in their structures, as well as relevant results from in silico, in&#8201;vitro, and/or in&#8201;vivo studies against a variety of important target biomolecules, highlighting the role of fluorine&#8208;containing moieties.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#946;&#8208;Siloxy Diamines and Application as Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines are developed as diverse diamine organocatalysts. The synthetic methodology enables structural diversification through Grignard reactions, as well as subsequent silylation and amination. These diamines catalyzed enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water with improved enantioselectivity (up to 53% ee) compared to conventional catalysts.

&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines are developed as a tunable scaffold for structurally diverse diamine&#8208;based organocatalysts. Synthesis is initiated with the reaction of an oxazolidine methyl ester from L&#8208;serine with various Grignard reagents, introducing a wide range of diaryl substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position. By adjusting the reaction sequence of the silylation and amination steps, the developed synthetic approach enables the incorporation of diverse aryl, silyl, and amine groups, including cyclic, acyclic tertiary, and secondary amines, into 1,2&#8208;diamines. The resulting diamines are evaluated as catalysts in the enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide. Although the yield is similar to that of the conventional catalyst C1, the enantioselectivity is improved, reaching up to 53% ee.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclization Reactions with &#947;&#8208;Hydroxyenones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent advancements in &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenone&#8208;based organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization techniques is given in this review paper. Because &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones are bifunctional, they are an effective building block for creating oxa&#8208;heterocycles.

This review article provides an overview of the recent developments in organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization strategies utilizing &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones.&#8201; Due to the bifunctional nature of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones, it is a powerful building block for synthesizing oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The cyclization strategies are systematically categorized based on the nature of the organocatalysts employed: (i) chiral prolinol analogs, which obtain tetrahydrofuran&#8208;fused 3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins and 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydrofurans; (ii) chiral bifunctional squaramides, affording diverse spirocyclic frameworks such as spiro&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;pyrazolones, morpholinones, and oxindole&#8208;derived systems; (iii) chiral bifunctional thioureas, which forms 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes, oxazolidines, and cyclic acetals; (iv) multifunctional modular organocatalysts, affording enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones; and (v) other chiral organocatalysts which cannot be grouped in previous categories such as Song's chiral oligoethylene glycol as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst leads to the generation of chiral 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazinanes.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of 10&#8208;Aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes and Azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones</title>

         <dc:description>
A cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes, as well as their derivatives, is presented. The work highlights improve reactivity using enamines from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine, followed by electrophilic chlorination and oxidation. Structural, optical, and electrochemical investigations elucidate unique properties, offering promising applications in organic electronic and photonic devices.

An efficient synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes has achieved via [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohepta[b]furan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an enamine is generated from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine in good yields. Oxidation of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulene and azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.

         <title>Multigram Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Functionalized Terminal Alkynes with B2Pin2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of cheap and accessible reactants for copper&#8208;mediated borylation of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the thorough assessment of different ligands/additives for various types of substrates, a simple decision tree for the optimal reaction condition choice is proposed. Using the developed methodology, a series of synthetically valuable alkenyl boronates is prepared on 10&#8211;300&#8201;g scale in single run.

A comprehensive study of the commercially available ligands/additives in the formal copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the common reaction system (CuCl&#8211;B2Pin2), a set of common and inexpensive ligands or additives&#8212;namely, rac&#8208;BINAP, PPh3, [(t&#8208;Bu)3PH]BF4, and LiCl&#8212;is tested for its effects on the borylation regioselectivity and overall reaction efficiency. The results observed demonstrate correlation between the substrate nature (propargylic, homopropargylic, or higher homolog) and the ligand, which can be used for the preferential preparation of linear or branched isomer of the target alkenyl boronic species. It is found that LiCl and (t&#8208;Bu)3P can be used for preparation of &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boronates, whereas &#945;&#8208;substituted isomers are preferentially obtained in the presence of triarylphopsphine ligands. The scope of the transformations covers derivatives of protected (homo)propargylic alcohols and amines and tolerated free alcohol, ether, silyl ether, ketal, ester, and alkene moieties. The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).

         <title>Copper Coils as Efficient and Inexpensive Reactors for the Synthesis of Tetrazoles in Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;coil reactors are used for the synthesis of tetrazoles starting from benzonitriles in continuous flow. The reaction is carried out at high temperatures and residence times, in the presence of sodium azide, making the flow chemistry approach safer than the batch alternatives. Several tetrazoles have been prepared, including a key precursor of sartan drugs.

Sartans are an important family of drugs used to treat hypertension. A common characteristic of most of them is a biphenyl moiety with a tetrazole ring in the ortho position of the phenyl&#8211;phenyl bond. This tetrazole is typically synthesized from the respective nitriles through a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition. However, the use of large amounts of azides at high temperatures for extended periods of time is inherently concerning, as serious accidents can occur if safety protocols are not thoroughly developed and implemented. The implementation of these procedures in continuous flow would therefore be beneficial from the safety perspective. In this article, a method is presented for the preparation of tetrazoles from the respective nitriles employing a copper coil as reactor and catalyst. The reaction parameters have been studied and optimized to maximize conversion. A variety of benzonitriles with different ring substituents have been transformed in moderate to good yields and copper leaching has been analyzed, showing that the copper leached is enough to catalyze this reaction. More interestingly, the method has been applied to obtain the tetrazole ring present in a key intermediate used in sartan manufacturing, a highly sterically hindered compound.

         <title>Substrate Divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; Electrocyclization of CF3&#8208;Quinolone Heterodendralenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;dependent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of in&#8201;situ generated CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones is described. Phenyl substitution favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give CF3&#8208;substituted cyclobuta[c]quinolones bearing a CF3&#8208;containing quaternary center, while vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to yield CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

Herein, a substrate&#8208;divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of hitherto unknown CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes is disclosed, generated in&#8201;situ from the 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones. The reaction favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization in the presence of a phenyl substituent, producing cyclobuta[c]quinolones featuring a challenging CF3&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Conversely, vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to provide CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Nanosponges Loaded with Palladium as Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Synthesis of Challenging Derivatives with Pharmaceutical Relevance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cellulose&#8208;based heterogeneous palladium catalyst (CNS&#8208;Pd) for the efficient and selective Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, including scaffolds derived from unstable boronic molecules. The study emphasizes the use of mild conditions, high yields, and reduced palladium leaching, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional homogeneous systems in complex molecule synthesis.

Developing efficient catalytic systems is crucial for synthesizing complex heterocyclic compounds used in pharmaceuticals. However, key motifs, like pyridine and furan derivatives, pose challenges due to regioselectivity and sensitivity to harsh conditions. Conventional homogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while effective, suffer from catalyst recovery issues, palladium contamination, and environmental concerns. To overcome these limitations, this study explores cellulose&#8208;based nanosponges as sustainable palladium supports for heterogeneous catalysis, enhancing stability and green chemistry integration. These nanostructured materials, synthesized from cellulose, provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area scaffold that enhances uniform palladium dispersion, with a 22% w/w overall loading measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and prevents metal leaching, integrating green chemistry principles and a safe&#8208;and&#8208;sustainable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach. In this work, the optimization of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings using CNS&#8208;Pd under mild conditions, showcasing the efficiency and selectivity of this heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, is presented. Notably, high reaction yields (65%&#8211;99%) even with unstable boronic derivatives are achieved, which are typically synthesized using homogeneous catalysts, often with poor yields, selectivity and purity of the final products. The obtained results underscore the potential of biopolymer&#8208;based catalysts to drive innovation in sustainable pharmaceutical synthesis, effectively bridging the gap between heterogeneous catalysis and pharmaceutical chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Hydrosilylation Reaction of Olefins Catalyzed by a Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild reaction conditions, the dinuclear ruthenium catalyst is used to achieve an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation reaction of olefins. Notably, the reaction is extremely selective and no alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, or isomerization products are detected in this reaction.

Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis is presented as a strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefins. Both aliphatic and aromatic olefins smoothly undergo anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation under mild reaction conditions to produce the corresponding organosilicon products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (42&#8211;96%) with high selectivity. The formation of alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, and isomerization products is not observed. Synthetically valuable functional groups such as chloro atom, methoxycarbonyl, and ester are tolerated well under the current reaction conditions. Control experiments and mechanistic studies suggest a synergistic catalytic mechanism involving bimetallic cooperation.

         <title>Molecular Iodine&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Sulfoxonium Ylides with Thiocyanates, Xanthates, and Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;xanthates, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanates, and &#945;&#8208;dithiocarbamates has been developed. By employing molecular iodine and the potassium salts of xanthates, thiocyanate, and dithiocarbamates, a wide range of products is obtained, with yields reaching up to 83%. Sulfoxonium ylides derived from esters, ketones, amides, heterocycles, and steroids are successfully functionalized under these conditions.

In this work, a straightforward, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective protocol is presented for synthesizing three distinct classes of &#945;&#8208;functionalized sulfoxonium ylides&#8212;&#945;&#8208;xanthate, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate, and &#945;&#8208;dithiocarbamate&#8212;via molecular iodine&#8208;mediated reactions. This method demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, including heterocycles and steroids, delivering 25 examples with yields of up to 83%. Experimental studies revealed that iodine reacts with xanthates to form disulfides, which subsequently act as electrophiles for nucleophilic attack by the ylide.

         <title>An Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of Finerenone via Evans&#8217; Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates Evans&#8217; (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone auxiliary enables efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone, achieving stereoselective naphthyridine core construction with 86:14 dr and 80% yield. Subsequent ammonia&#8208;mediated transamidation of the ethyl ester completes finerenone formation.

This article reports a new application of Evans&#8217; chiral auxiliary for an efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone. This new application successfully achieves the key step of stereoselective construction of the naphthyridine core of finerenone, with a high diastereomeric ratio (dr 86:14) and an 80% yield of the desired product via Evans&#8217; chiral (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The downstream transamidation of ethyl ester, with ammonia, leads to the formation of finerenone.

         <title>Anion Recognition&#8208;Induced Selective Separation of Phosphates from Complex Aqueous Matrices by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Capsule</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triethanolamine&#8208;based anion receptor functionalized with H&#8208;bond donating urea groups has been designed and synthesized for selective separation of hydrophilic phosphates from aqueous media of high anionic and cationic complexity. Competitive extraction experiments reveal exclusive formation of the phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing anions, a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from eutrophic aquatic systems.

Selective recognition of an oxoanion necessitates the design and synthesis of hydrogen bond donor receptors capable of discriminating between anions of comparable size, shape, and basicity. A urea&#8208;functionalized second&#8208;generation tripodal anion receptor has been demonstrated to selectively encapsulate and separate phosphate ions (PO43&#8208;, and HPO42&#8208;) from aqueous matrices of high anionic and cationic complexity.

         <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;Diones by Tandem of Azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem of the azido&#8208;Ugi and four&#8208; or three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (Ugi&#8208;4CR, Ugi&#8208;3CR) becomes a new and unusual approach for the construction of a morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione ring functionalized with a tetrazole moiety. Preisolation of Ugi bisamides is an alternative to the one&#8208;pot transformation with intramolecular cyclization. Subsequent conversion of the morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones enables the preparation of their NH&#8208;unsubstituted tetrazole derivatives.

3,4&#8208;Disubstituted morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety are unexpected products of a tandem combination of azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi reactions. The formation of the classical products &#8211; Ugi bisamides &#8211; is not observed at all in many cases. When the simplest C1&#8208;C3 aliphatic aldehydes are used and the reaction conditions are controlled, their isolation is possible. However, when butanal and pentanal as well as para&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes are used, only products of post&#8208;Ugi transformations, morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones, can be isolated. The latter can be synthesized either sequentially from the corresponding Ugi bisamides by post&#8208;Ugi transformation or in a one&#8208;pot procedure with prolonged stirring of the reaction mixture of four components&#8211;&#945;&#8208;aminomethyltetrazole, aldehyde, monochloroacetic acid, and isocyanide. A small targeted library of 15 morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety is obtained by a novel approach. Furthermore, these compounds are able to eliminate the N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group from the tetrazole nitrogen in the presence of acid to form the corresponding NH&#8208;unsubstituted tetrazole derivatives of morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones.

         <title>C4&#8208;Regioselective Dearomatization of Quinolinium Salts via Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traceless switch of regioselectivity: without employing any directing groups, the change of selectivity in the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction with N&#8208;alkylquinolinium electrophiles is attained. Simply by modifying the counterion in the azaarenium salt and the reaction conditions, a C4&#8208;addition of acrylate can be accomplished, complementing the earlier C2&#8208;selective protocol.

An intermolecular Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction employing N&#8208;benzylquinolinium salts as electrophiles is developed. The reaction proceeds through a C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of the quinolinium substrate, contrary to the C2&#8208;regioselectivity that is observed in a previous report on a similar process. The switch in the regioselectivity is accomplished through the change of the counterion in the quinolinium salt to PF6&#8722; and the alteration of the reaction conditions, such as the application of a different catalyst (DABCO). The reaction allows for the preparation of functional group&#8208;rich products featuring the important 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline scaffold, complementing the earlier method which provides the corresponding 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline counterparts. The developed reaction is compatible with a range of substrates that also encompasses acridinium salts.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H functionalization, offers atom&#8208;economical routes to synthesize and functionalize complex molecules. This review covers recent advancements in N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formations, integrating mechanistic insights, diverse catalysts, and synthetic applications, emphasizing their profound impact on modern organic synthesis.

During the past decades, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H functionalization has gained recognition as a powerful method in organic synthesis. This strategy provides efficient and atom&#8208;economical pathways for quickly creating molecular complexity by harnessing the abundant C&#63743;H bonds found in readily accessible chemical feedstocks. Synthetic organic chemists discover directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H activation as a key tool for achieving efficient and site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization. Bidentate directing groups are particularly effective in this regard, offering a high degree of control over the reaction site. Among various directing groups, N,O&#8208;bidentate systems have gained significant attention due to their strong coordinating ability and versatility in enabling regioselective transformations. This review highlights recent advances in C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formation reactions facilitated by N,O&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The discussion encompasses mechanistic insights, catalyst systems, and synthetic applications, demonstrating the broad utility of these strategies in modern organic synthesis. A comparative analysis of different N,O&#8208;bidentate ligands and their role in tuning reactivity and selectivity is also presented.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Lactam&#8208;Type Iminosugars by Cascade Radical Cleavage of &#945;&#8208;Amino Carbonyl Compound and Intramolecular Amidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars or 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives through cascade radical cleavage of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds and intra&#8208;/intermolecular amidation reactions.

A metal&#8208;free method is developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars using hydrogen peroxide (35% in water) as an oxidant. The reaction of various &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds is performed in methanol, and the active methylene adjacent to the carbonyl group is rapidly removed to form a carboxylic acid as the key intermediate through a cascade radical cleavage reaction. Following an intramolecular amidation reaction, a series of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars are prepared in satisfactory yields, providing an alternative protocol for the synthesis of such bioactive iminosugars. Additionally, several 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives are obtained by intermolecular amidation of the carboxylic acid intermediate.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. This reagent reacts readily with a series of alkylzinc reagents under copper catalysis to yield allylic monofluorides with high regioselectivity and excellent yields.

A bench&#8208;stable and scalable monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) has been developed for highly regioselective mono&#8208;fluoroallylation. This reagent is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. The reaction of alkylzinc reagents with MFAS proceeds smoothly under copper catalysis, yielding allylic monofluorides with excellent regioselectivity and high reaction efficiency.

         <dc:description>
Isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one is a core structure in many bioactive molecules, natural products, and advanced materials. Its efficient and sustainable synthesis has garnered significant attention in organic synthesis. This review highlights recent advancements in the synthesis of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one via metal&#8208;catalyzed, metal&#8208;free, photocatalytic, and electrocatalytic methods.

This abstract highlights recent advancements in the synthesis of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one via metal&#8208;catalyzed, metal&#8208;free, photocatalytic, and electro&#8208;catalytic methods. Transition metal catalysis, employing palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, cobalt, copper, etc. complexes, enables versatile cyclization and functionalization pathways. Metal&#8208;free approaches leverage organo&#8208;catalysts and green oxidants for milder, environmentally benign conditions. Photocatalysis utilizes visible&#8208;light&#8208;active catalysts, enabling oxidative or reductive transformations with minimal waste. Electrocatalysis, offering tunable electrochemical conditions, facilitates C&#63743;H activation and coupling strategies under ambient conditions. These methodologies display high regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and improved sustainability. Advances in these areas underscore the synergistic potential of combining catalytic techniques for the design of novel synthetic routes. This review serves as a foundation for developing more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to constructing the isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one scaffold.

         <title>A C3&#8208;Symmetric Diphenylethylendiamine&#8208;Based Catalyst in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones with 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarin and 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;One</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two C3&#8208;symmetric organocatalysts with multiple amino groups are prepared and employed in the asymmetric addition of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one to unsaturated ketones. The all&#8208;amino version of the catalyst induces the better stereoselectivity and provides the products in up to 95% yield. A successful gram&#8208;scale reaction and catalyst reuse (three&#8208;fold) attest to the potential of the C3&#8208;symmetric catalyst.

Even though the amino&#8208;organocatalysis has been known for decades, the use of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric multiamino catalysts in asymmetric synthesis is not widespread. Herein, the previously employed approach for the chiral 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;cyclohexane to the enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diphenylethylendiamine is extended. The independent activity of each catalytic subunit is also confirmed for this enantiopure motif by offline high&#8208;resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) experiments. The advantages and limitations of this novel approach in the asymmetric Michael addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 4&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, achieving up to 95% yield and moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good stereocontrol (enantiomeric ratio up to 80:20) are evaluated. In the pool of synthetized molecules, there are two novel compounds, and one is prepared for the first time using organocatalysis. In addition, some of these molecules show an intrinsic scavenging ability on ABTS&#8226;+ radical.

         <title>The Dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Core: From Syntheses to Properties and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest research progress in synthesis and application of variously decorated aromatic compounds possessing the indeno[2.1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold is summarized. In addition to covering synthetic endeavors, their transformation to other structurally related aromatic compounds and their physical properties and possible applications are also outlined.

In the last decade, substances possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold show interesting photophysical properties and other potential applications in electronics. The aforementioned compounds belong to the family of five regioisomeric dihydroindenofluorenes, but unlike other ones, they possess angular or, in the case of higher congeners, helical shape. This review is mainly focused on various synthetic approaches to compounds possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold and their conversions to other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, their physicochemical and photophysical properties, and current and/or potential applications are briefly described as well.

Synthesis of quinoline and bis&#8208;quinoline derivatives is reported using nickel chloride hexahydrate catalyst via Michael addition followed by aldol condensation from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and o&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol. The protocol enables access to products in good to excellent yields in toluene at 100&#8201;&#176;C and in open&#8208;air condition under green chemistry metrics of the reaction.

Two&#8208;component synthesis of quinoline and bis&#8208;quinoline derivatives using nickel chloride hexahydrate as a catalyst via Michael addition followed by aldol condensation from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and o&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol. This protocol enables access to phenyl(2&#8208;phenylquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methanone and bis(2&#8208;phenylquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methanone derivatives in good to excellent yields using toluene solvent at 100&#8201;&#176;C temperature in open&#8208;air condition. Nickel chloride hexahydrate has been utilized in this study to oxidize benzyl alcohols to intermediate benzaldehydes. Green chemistry metrics of the reaction explain the dominance of the methodology. The structural characterization of the compounds was confirmed by 1H, 13C, Infrared (IR), UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis.

         <title>Mild Photocatalytic Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acid Derivatives using Xanthene Dyes for Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant xanthene&#8208;based method for metal&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;free photocatalytic deoxygenation of lipidic biomass is reported, featuring DIPEA as a dual&#8208;function sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor, enabling efficient one&#8208;pot Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbon synthesis under mild, open&#8208;air conditions.

A complementary and practical method for the synthesis of renewable Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbons with yields of up to 80%, via mild photocatalytic hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids activated as N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, is reported herein. Inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and environmentally friendly xanthene dyes (Eosin Y or Fluorescein&#8208;Na2) act as photocatalysts, with DIPEA serving as both sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor. The reactions proceed under visible light, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, in open&#8208;air conditions. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot application is demonstrated, involving in&#8201;situ ester formation and scale&#8208;up using a real mixture of fatty acids derived from vegetable oil, for photocatalytic biomass valorization.

This reported protocol can produce biologically active pyridoquinazolinones in a single step from readily available starting materials.

A mild, cost&#8208;effective, one&#8208;pot, and metal&#8208;free hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated protocol for the production of pyridoquinazolinones from 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;chloropyridines at room temperature has been established. This reported procedure can easily produce biologically active pyridoquinazolinones in a one&#8208;pot manner utilizing readily available starting materials. Operational simplicity, moderate reaction conditions, high atom economy, and high yield are some key features of this protocol.

Fjord&#8208;Stitching Strategy Enables Chiral Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts! Herein, the synthesis of chiral heteroatom&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts via fjord&#8208;stitching C&#63743;N coupling reactions of easily accessible resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with diverse chiral amines is demonstrated.

Herein, the synthesis of diverse chiral O/N&#8208;doped zigzag hydrocarbon belts based on bridging of the fjords of resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with chiral amines through palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#63743;N bond formation reactions is reported. The resulting nanobelts exhibit unique chiral cavity structures and demonstrate intriguing chiroptical properties.

         <dc:description>
Our iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation methodology affords high product yields and does not require pre&#8208;functionalized substrates &#8211; a distinct advantage over conventional Heck&#8208;type cyclization protocols. Substrate scope and mechanistic investigations reveal that electron&#8208;donating substituents on the ring D moiety are critical for successful cyclization.These observations are consistent with a reaction pathway involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of an iridium species onto ring D.

An intramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation process is described for the synthesis of the title scaffold from phenacyl enamide substrates. This method achieves high yields while eliminating the requirement for prefunctionalized substrates, as compared to Heck&#8208;type cyclization methodologies. Substrate scope and mechanistic studies indicate that the presence of electron&#8208;donating substituents in the incipient ring D moiety is essential for the cyclization, consistent with a pathway involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of iridium in ring D.

         <title>A Fullerene&#8208;Based Selenosugar Ball</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties is synthesized efficiently with a Th&#8208;symmetry from a hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared by a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This new compound is characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques and is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

Fullerenes functionalized with selenosugar moieties are of particular interest because of their important properties, as one fragment enhances the properties of the other. Selenosugars are not only solubilizing groups, but their intrinsic biological properties also provide additional attractive features to the conjugates. Here the synthesis is reported of a fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties with a Th&#8208;symmetric structure, which can be efficiently synthesized from the hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared via a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This large&#8208;scale system, refer to as the selenosugar ball (SeB), has been characterized by 1H&#8201;NMR and 13C&#8201;NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Theoretical calculations using the multilevel DFT&#8208;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/6&#8211;311&#8201;G(2&#8201;d,p)//PM7 methodology are performed to predict the most stable conformation for the compound and to determine the factors that control the geometry of this molecule. In addition, some physicochemical parameters are estimated. Also, this new compound is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

         <title>The Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Mono&#8208; and Diketones Uncovers their Potential as Electrophilic Warheads for Reversible Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fluorinated mono&#8208; and diketones as electrophilic warheads for reversible covalent drugs is described by studying their equilibria reactions with the protected nucleophilic amino acids serine, cysteine and lysine.

Fluorinated diketones (FDKs) are electrophilic moieties holding unique molecular properties that make them potential reversible and multifaceted covalent warheads for drug design. To further explore this potential, the multicomponent equilibrium systems of various fluorinated monoketones (FMKs) and FDKs in the presence of the relevant nucleophilic amino acids serine, cysteine, and lysine are studied. These equilibrium systems are investigated using 19&#8201;F&#8208; and 13C&#8208; NMR spectroscopy, and reveal that for both cysteine and lysine most of the FMKs and FDKs studied may potentially serve as electrophilic warheads for reversible covalent drugs.

         <title>Novel Ambergris Odorants Devoid of Ketal Functions: Sustainable Synthesis of 4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;Cedren&#8208;8&#8208;yl)Butan&#8208;2&#8208;Ones and Potent Methoxy Derivatives by Claisen Chemistry**</title>

         <dc:description>
The mystery behind the new odorant. Ambronova from sustainable &#945;&#8208;cedrane is not only the unusual polar methoxy group in the ketal moiety but also two novel methoxy ketones accessible in pure form by Claisen chemistry from &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol and methoxy acetone. Their highly potent dry&#8208;woody ambergris notes prove that a ketal function is no prerequisite for a dry woody ambergris odorant.

Challenging the importance of the ketal functionality in ambergris odorants, the optionally &#945;&#8208;methoxy substituted ketones 18&#8211;20 are designed using an olfactophore model and synthesized by Claisen chemistry from &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol (25) as a sustainable starting material with methoxy acetone (15) and acetone dimethyl ketal (29) as synthetic building blocks. Elimination of one alkoxy group with phosphoric acid in pyridine furnished vinyl ethers to which &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol (25) is added in the presence of acetic acid. Thermal Claisen rearrangement of the resulting adducts then provides the target compound 18&#8211;20 that possesses potent dry woody&#8208;ambery odors with musky aspects that make them ideally suited for oud accords. Surprisingly, the &#945;&#8208;methoxy substituted ketones 18 and 19 are also formed in the synthesis of the new odorant Ambronova, where they contribute to a more musky&#8208;soft, sensual&#8208;animalic character compared to Ambrocenide (1) with additional peppery accents. The content of the desirable 3&#8208;methoxy ketone 19 could be increased by using 1,2,2&#8208;trimethoxypropane (21), thereby finetuning the Ambronova quality. These results show that a ketal functionality is no longer an indispensable prerequisite for an ambergris odorant, which should facilitate the design of further high&#8208;impact ambergris odorants devoid of ketal functionalities with potentially enhanced biodegradability.

         <title>Cobalt(I)&#8208;Catalyzed E&#8208;Selective Hydroalkynylation of Terminal Alkynes or Internal Alkynes with Silyl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation of silyl&#8208;substituted terminal alkynes, acting as CH&#8208;donor alkynes, with aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted terminal alkynes, acting as acceptor alkynes, is described. Cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation with internal alkynes acting as acceptor alkynes is successful when at least one aryl substituent is present. The reaction optimization is performed by the Design of Experiments approach, limiting the needed test reactions to a minimum.

A stereoselective cross&#8208;dimerization between silyl&#8208;substituted donor alkynes and aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted terminal acceptor alkynes using an in&#8201;situ generated Co(I)&#8208;phosphine catalyst is reported. The reaction optimization for both classes of acceptor alkynes is conducted via Design of Experiments and showed high E&#8208;selectivities using different reaction conditions. Moreover, activated internal alkynes are successfully applied as acceptor alkynes in the cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation, leading to highly substituted 1,3&#8208;enynes in good regioselectivities and good to excellent yields.

         <title>Denitrogenative Triazole Ring Cleavage in Synthesis of 2&#8208;Functionalized (Cyclo)alkyl&#8208;4.5&#8208;Unsubstituted Oxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;(cyclo)alkyl&#8208;substituted oxazoles is synthesized via a denitrogenative triazole ring&#8208;cleavage strategy. The solvent&#8208;free conditions allow the introduction of primary and secondary amines, as well as carboxylic and alkoxycarboxylic groups on the (cyclo)alkyl side chain. The approach is also applicable to optically active substrates, enabling the synthesis of oxazole&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;amino acids from readily available D&#8208; and L&#8208;aspartic acid.

Denitrogenative triazole ring cleavage is applied for the preparation of a broad set of 2&#8208;(cyclo)alkylo&#8208;xazole derivatives. The proposed procedures involve carrying out the reaction of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole with various functionally substituted acid chlorides in sulfolane or under neat conditions. Despite the exothermic nature of the reaction, it affords the target products in high yield. Various functional groups are tolerated in the (cyclo)alkyl chain such as protected primary and secondary amine and esters. The developed procedure is applied for the preparation of optically active amino acids featuring oxazole moiety.

Recent Advances in Catalyst&#8208;Mediated [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] Cycloaddition Reactions: A Concise Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions, especially [6+4] cycloaddition reactions, have been widely applied in the construction of 10&#8208;membered rings and natural compounds. However, these reactions encounter several challenges, including achieving regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, overcoming high activation energy barriers, and managing multiple reaction pathways. In this review, we summarize the reported on [6+4] cycloaddition reactions, highlighting various catalysts, including metal, Lewis acid, organocatalysts, and enzyme&#8208;based catalysts.

Higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions (CRs) are significant in providing quick access to different polycyclic and complex molecules. In particular, [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] CRs have been widely applied in the construction of 10&#8208;membered rings, bridged molecules, and natural compounds. However, these reactions encounter several challenges, including achieving regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, overcoming high activation energy barriers, and managing multiple reaction pathways. Over the past decade, numerous catalysts have been developed to address these challenges. The present review summarizes the reported research (2000&#8211;2024) on [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] CRs, highlighting various catalysts, including metal, Lewis acid, organocatalysts, and enzyme&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>A Concave Mirror Photoreactor Design for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concave mirror&#8208;based photoreactor boosts reaction rates across diverse visible&#8208;light transformations. This modular, cost&#8208;effective design enhances illumination of the reaction mixture, accelerates photocatalytic transformations and supports small&#8208;scale experiments, offering a practical solution for researchers in the field.

A novel photoreactor design for enhanced reaction efficiency and reproducibility is disclosed. The performance of the new setup with a spherical mirror&#8208;like architecture is evaluated through six versatile visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations reported in the literature. Inexpensive, modular, and adaptable, photoreactor enables an increase in optical power and provides significant acceleration of photocatalytic reactions in all cases. Parallel experiments as well as small&#8208;scale chemistry are also examined.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioxothiazolidinone and Iminothiazolidinone Derivatives via Dicyano Epoxide&#8208;Based Multicomponent Reactions in Green Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;component reaction of dicyanoepoxide toward the efficient synthesis of thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones, 2&#8208;imino&#8208;thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and amido dithiocarbamate, in green media has been described. The use of green solvents, metal and catalyst&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions and excellent product yields are among the most important advantages of this sustainable approach.

A green and efficient multicomponent protocol has been developed for the synthesis of thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones via the reaction of carbon disulfide, primary amines, and dicyanoepoxides in water. The transformation proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, offering broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields. Notably, using secondary amine selectively affords a dithiocarbamate derivative, highlighting tunable chemoselectivity. A complementary reaction involving isothiocyanates, primary amines, and dicyanoepoxides in ethanol enables access to 2&#8208;imino&#8208;thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones. Both methods provide sustainable, scalable routes to biologically relevant heterocycles.

Syntheses of Annoglabasin A and Annomosin A, ent&#8208;Kaurane Diterpenoids from Annonaceae, Using Stevia Sweetener as a Cost&#8208;Effective Synthetic Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthetic method for the preparation of ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids from commercially available stevia sweeteners. By enabling the efficient synthesis of ent&#8208;kaurenol, this approach facilitates access to a wide variety of structurally diverse and stereochemically defined kaurane derivatives, including annomosin A and annoglabasin A.

A practical and cost&#8208;effective method is developed for preparing steviol from commercially available stevia sweetener. As steviol can be efficiently converted into ent&#8208;kaurenol, this strategy enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ent&#8208;kaurenol and its derivatives. To demonstrate the versatility of ent&#8208;kaurenol as a synthetic intermediate, several derivatives are synthesized, including carboxylic acid and diol compounds with controlled C&#8208;16 stereochemistry. This methodology is applied to the synthesis of the ent&#8208;kaurane dimer annomosin A, isolated from Annona squamosa, and the bioactive diterpene annoglabasin A, from Annona glabra. The approach allows access to structurally diverse kaurane derivatives with defined C&#8208;16 stereochemistry and is readily extendable to the synthesis of kaurane dimers. Given the limited understanding of the biosynthetic pathways and biological functions of natural kaurane dimers, this synthetic strategy provides a valuable platform for future structural and functional investigations.

         <title>Sonogashira&#8208;like Reaction of the Biellmann BODIPY and Fluorescence Staining of the Tomato Crop Bacterial Pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis with the Resulting Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meso&#8208;methylsulfanyl&#8208;BODIPY derivative (Biellmann BODIPY) underwent Sonogashira&#8208;like cross&#8208;coupling with terminal alkynes under mild conditions to yield a family of novel fluorescent meso&#8208;arylethynyl BODIPYs. These derivatives are characterized by photophysical and computational methods, and some are successfully applied as fluorescent markers for the selective staining of the phytopathogen Clavibacter michiganensis.

Meso&#8208;methylsulfanylBODIPY (Biellmann BODIPY) participated in a Sonogashira&#8208;like reaction with terminal alkynes, thereby broadening its application as a privileged building block. A series of meso&#8208;substituted BODIPYs with arylethynyl groups of different electronic character is prepared (7 new derivatives), as well as a single by&#8208;product having a meso&#8208;double bond. The photophysical properties of the series are experimentally studied by static and dynamic spectroscopy, and the results are rationalized by theoretical calculations. The molecules with triple bonds present absorption and emission maxima that are redshifted with respect to the derivative with a double bond, and larger fluorescence quantum yields, likely because of lower energy losses due to internal conversion. In particular, the BODIPYs with trimethylsilylethynylene, p&#8208;phenoxyphenylethynylene, and p&#8208;benzaldehyde exhibited good fluorescence quantum yields and resulted to be soluble in DMSO, for which they are used to stain the phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis (Cm) that affects tomato crops. Interestingly, the BODIPY bearing the &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;SiMe3 group does not interact with the bacteria, while for the other two derivatives, the stained Cm are clearly detected by laser scanning microscopy. This likely indicates that aromatic substituents increase the adhesion of the BODIPYs to the wall of Cm.

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Difluoroenoxysilanes via Visible Light&#8208;Excited Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven decarboxylative alkylation reaction is reported, mediated by a photoexcited electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex formed by redox&#8208;active esters and triphenylamine.

This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, photocatalyst&#8208;free method for synthesizing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones via electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex activation. Using cost&#8208;effective aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives redox&#8208;active esters, the protocol enables decarboxylative difluoroalkylation under mild conditions, achieving high yields (up to 94%) with triphenylamine. Mechanistic studies confirm radical intermediates and a 1:1 EDA complex stoichiometry. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and successful late&#8208;stage drug modifications, offering a sustainable approach to fluorinated bioactive compounds.

Galactose Oxidase&#8208;Catalyzed Benchtop and Electrochemical Oxidation of C1&#8208;Alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galactopyranoside Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wild&#8208;type galactose oxidase (GalOx) is used to oxidize C&#8208;1 substituted &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranosides bearing linear, branched, or cyclic groups. Reaction conditions are optimized for both benchtop and electrochemical setups. Substrate&#8208;dependent reactivity trends reveal that C&#8208;1 modifications influence enzyme&#8211;substrate interactions without preventing oxidation. Electrochemical activation offers a viable horseradish peroxidase&#8208;free alternative.

The reaction conditions of wild&#8208;type galactose oxidase (GalOx)&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of C&#8208;1 alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives are established and optimized. The benchtop oxidation reaction uses a three&#8208;enzyme system comprising GalOx, catalase, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Under the optimized conditions, methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside achieves 86% conversion after 24&#8201;h of reaction at room temperature. No previous study has investigated how the C&#8208;1 position of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives influences GalOx&#8211;substrate interactions. To address this, a panel of C&#8208;1 alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives is synthesized and tested for the first time. The results show that although GalOx tolerates modifications at the C&#8208;1 position, the size, shape, and electronic properties of the substituent significantly affect catalytic efficiency. The same &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives are also investigated on an electrochemical setup, which replaces the HRP activator with electrochemical activation. The electrochemical activation method achieves comparable conversion and preserves substrate specificity, offering a promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional enzymatic setups. This work provides a foundation for understanding C&#8208;1 structural tolerance in GalOx&#8211;substrate interactions and demonstrates electrochemical activation as a promising and practical alternative to traditional enzymatic activation.

         <title>Synthetic Route to Fluoroalkylselenylchalcogeno Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of molecules with emerging fluorinated substituents associating fluoroalkyl group, selenium and another chalcogen (RF&#8211;Se&#8211;E&#8211;R) has been described. These molecules were easily obtained by using electrophilic fluoroalkylselenolating reagents and thiols, selenols, disulfides, diselenides or ditellurides.

In order to obtain new molecules with specific properties, the design of new fluorinated emerging group is an interesting approach. Herein, the development of new fluorinated motifs is described by associating fluoroalkyl groups with selenium and another chalcogen. Such compounds are obtained by efficient electrophilic fluoralkylselenolations of chalcogen substrates by using two previously described reagents. Thus, molecules bearing RFSeS, RFSeSe and RFSeTe motifs have been obtained with good yields.

         <title>General and Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Selective Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes with Non&#8208;Activated Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Marovnikov hydroaryation non&#8208;functionalized olefins has been developed.

The majority of C&#8211;C coupling reactions between arenes and olefins result in the formation of branched isomer products, exhibiting what is known as Markovnikov selectivity. However, alternative catalytic strategies are required to modulate this selectivity, thereby yielding linear isomer products that are crucial for various significant applications. In this study, a straightforward Ni0&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst is presented for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated olefins with arenes (benzene) and heteroarenes (pyridine, indole, and imidazopyridine derivatives). The active catalyst species are in&#8201;situ generated from NHC ligands and a stable NiII salt that is reduced by an alkaline hydride (NaH, LiH). This strategy circumvents the elaborate procedures that have been employed to synthesize and isolate Ni0&#8211;NHC complexes. The assessment of &gt;15 reactions between olefins and (hetero)arenes shows the formation of linear isomers as the predominant products, with yields ranging from moderate to excellent and exceptional selectivity.

         <title>Effects of Ring Strain on Molecular Dynamics of Sterically Hindered 4,7&#8208;Phenanthroline Unit</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure via a gold macrocyclic complex to evaluate effects of ring strain on molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8722;phenanthroline moieties. The rotation rate of the phenyl groups in the cyclic trimer is faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. 

The Povarov reaction is a well&#8208;known multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives from anilines, arylaldehydes, and dienophiles such as electron&#8208;rich alkenes and alkynes. In this study, a sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure to evaluate the effects of ring strain on the molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8208;phenanthroline moieties. The phenanthroline derivative is converted into a cyclic trimer, [3]McPhen, via a gold (Au) macrocyclic complex. The rate of rotation of the phenyl groups in [3]McPhen is found to be faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the ring strain of [3]McPhen causes a favorable orientation of the phenyl groups for rotation. This research offers valuable insights into the influence of ring strain on the dynamics of the molecular components.

&lt;p&gt;The Povarov reaction is a well-known multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives from anilines, arylaldehydes, and dienophiles such as electron-rich alkenes and alkynes. In this study, a sterically hindered 1,10-diphenyl-4,7-phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure to evaluate the effects of ring strain on the molecular dynamics of the 4,7-phenanthroline moieties.

Density functional theory calculations suggest that the ring strain of &lt;b&gt;[3]McPhen&lt;/b&gt; causes a favorable orientation of the phenyl groups for rotation.

         <title>Fast Oxidative Coupling Giving Functionalized Biaryls via Organocuprates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast access to functionalized symmetrical biaryls from bromoarenes has been achieved by a flash&#8208;flow sequence involving lithiation, transmetalation to copper, and oxidative coupling. Flash sequence has enabled the coupling of the substrates including reactive functional groups such as bromo, cyano, and nitro groups within seconds.

A fast, continuous&#8208;flow, and sequential reaction system composed of organolithium generation&#8211;transmetalation&#8211;coupling within seconds are developed. The choice of oxidants and the equivalent of copper species remarkably vary the reaction selectivity toward the biaryl coupling and/or the phenol formation. Short&#8208;lived aryllithium species, including bromo&#8208;, cyano&#8208;, or nitro&#8208;substituents, are successfully controlled under fast&#8208;flow conditions, despite the instability after transmetalation giving the organocopper species.

The presented protocol for the bromination of simple hydrocarbons produces 1,2&#8208;dibromoarylalkanes. This one&#8208;pot process is conducted under mild conditions using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone , blue light (470&#8201;nm), and a manganese(III) porphyrin catalyst. The products oxidised at the benzylic C&#63743;H position are obtained in the corresponding reaction without adding bromine.

         <title>5&#8208;Bromo&#8208;8&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1&#8208;Naphthoic Acid as Protective Group for Alcohols Under Mitsunobu Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protection of alcohols is carried out using the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH). Under Mitsunobu conditions, primary and secondary alcohols are converted into the corresponding esters, which are subsequently deprotected under mild reduction conditions.

The use of the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH) as a protective group for primary and secondary alcohols is described. Protection is carried out under Mitsunobu conditions, and the protective group can be readily removed under mild reducing conditions, due to the significant steric strain between C&#8208;1 and C&#8208;8 naphthalene substituents. The reaction has been tested with different hydroxy substrates, including monoalcohols, 1,2&#8208;diols, and the anticancer ribonucleoside 5&#8208;fluorouridine. Interestingly, in the case of linear 1,2&#8208;diols, protection occurs preferentially at the secondary alcohol. In addition, orthogonal protection is obtained with N&#8208;Boc hydroxy amino acid derivatives.

A trifluoromethylation/cyclization of alkenes to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted fused indoles using trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt is achieved under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions.

A photochemical trifluoromethylation/cyclization of alkenes to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted fused indoles using trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt (TFSP) is achieved under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation of Benzyl Bromides via Carbonyl Diimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous reports on accessing trifluoromethoxylated compounds have been limited by utilizing toxic/volatile/expensive precursors that required multistep preparation of trifluoromethylating reagents. Herein, this study proposes an efficient nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via commercially available, inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and solid reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF as the fluoride source through a novel mechanism not involving AgOCF3 as an intermediate.

An operationally simple nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via an inexpensive, commercially available and bench stable reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF is presented. Mechanistic studies are performed to reveal that this method does not proceed through the conventional trifluoromethoxide anion pathway that generates toxic difluorophosgene as an intermediate.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkynylthiolation of Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles. Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide &#8208; responsive aminoferrocene prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;&#8208; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non&#8208;targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;. This modification enhanced the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&#8325;&#8320; from 23.9&#8211;35.5 &#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4 &#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirmed that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation&#160;of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14 years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted environmentally benign synthesis of various 9&#8208;alkylbenzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives in the presence of 5 mol % disodium salt of eosin Y (EY) as photocatalyst is reported from 2&#8208;(7,8,9,10&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c]phe&#8208;nanthridin&#8208;6&#8208;yl) phenol derivatives, which were prepared through a three&#8208;component reaction. In the present protocol, EY photosensitized singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) promotes intramolecular cyclization through an oxidative hetero cross&#8208;coupling reaction, followed by aromatization to provide the final product in a single step, which has not been reported earlier. The mechanism of the reaction was established through DFT calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with BHT, which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer (EnT) process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Cyclic Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit significant potential for applications in electroluminescence, owing to their distinctive electronic structures and varied chemical properties. Phosphorus heterocycles serve multifunctional roles within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including as emitters, host matrices, and electron and hole blocking layers, contributing to enhanced device performance. Their intrinsic structural characteristics confer key advantages, including superior thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and suitable energy level alignment, all of which are essential for optimizing electroluminescent efficiency. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclics materials and discuss their structure property relationships, which would provide insights into expanding the applicability of OLEDs.</dc:description>
