         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.</dc:description>

         <title>Double addition of propargylzinc reagents onto acylcyanohydrins and cyanocarbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and mild synthetic methodology of double addition of propargylzinc reagents onto acylcyanohydrins and cyanocarbonates has been developed. After optimization of reaction conditions, dipropargylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted hydroxyamides and  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;protected amino alcohols have been straightforwardly prepared in good yields. The valorization of the so&#8208;obtained compounds was undertaken by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to provide functionalized pyridine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel approaches to design glycan&#8208;based antibacterial inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. In order to develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Promoted Carbon&#8208;Carbon Triple Bond Cleavage of Ynones for the Synthesis of Benzo[d]oxazoles/Benzo[d]thiazoles and 1&#8208;Arylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synchronous synthesis of functionalized benzo[d]oxazoles/benzo[d]thiazoles and 1&#8208;arylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones was reported, which was enabled by acid&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C triple bond cleavage of ynones.







Abstract
A synchronous synthesis of benzo[d]oxazoles/benzo [d]thiazoles and 1&#8208;arylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones enabled by acid&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C triple bond cleavage of ynones is disclosed. This reaction was accomplished with good tolerance of various functional groups and aminophenols/aminobenzenethiols to access the corresponding products, especially some structurally special 1&#8208;arylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones, in moderate to good yield. Furthermore, the readily accessible synthesis of some biologically active molecules has highlighted the synthetic utility of this strategy.

         <title>Access to Ketones through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phenol Derivatives with Nitroalkanes Followed by Nef Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>

Aryl ketones were prepared from aryl triflates and nitroalkanes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by Nef&#8208;type reaction in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
A practical protocol for the synthesis of ketones by Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of phenol derivatives with nitroalkanes followed by a Nef&#8208;type reaction has been developed. The readily available nitroalkanes served as alkyl nucleophiles under basic conditions to couple with easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phenol derivatives derived from naturally abundant phenols. The avoidance of using organometallics and organic halides makes this protocol more sustainable.

     alt="Access to Ketones through Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling of Phenol Derivatives with Nitroalkanes Followed by Nef Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryl ketones were prepared from aryl triflates and nitroalkanes through a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling followed by Nef-type reaction in a one-pot synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical protocol for the synthesis of ketones by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of phenol derivatives with nitroalkanes followed by a Nef-type reaction has been developed. The readily available nitroalkanes served as alkyl nucleophiles under basic conditions to couple with easy-to-handle phenol derivatives derived from naturally abundant phenols. The avoidance of using organometallics and organic halides makes this protocol more sustainable. The reaction was compatible with various functional groups, including nitro, cyano, acetyl, aldehyde, halide, and ester groups. Furthermore, the successful application of our method in drug synthesis exemplified its synthetic potential in pharmaceutical sciences. Preliminary mechanistic investigations strongly suggested the possible involvement of &#945;-aryl-substituted nitroalkane intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A practical and mild multicomponent approach for 3&#8208;heterocyclation 2&#8208;trifluoromethylation of indoles with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and CF3SO2Na was reported by using low&#8208;cost and catalytic amount of CuF2 as the catalyst. Various indoles and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were well tolerated and the desired products were obtained. Moreover, morphological study indicated hydrochloride 6&#8208;CO2Me derivative was capable to induce apoptosis of A549 cancer cells.







Abstract
A practical and mild three&#8208;component reaction of indoles, quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, and CF3SO2Na is disclosed for the facile access of various 3&#8208;[2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones using low&#8208;cost and catalytic amount of CuF2 as the catalyst. This strategy exhibits high site&#8208;selectivity, step economy, and broad substrates scope. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl triazoles compounds via a click chemistry. To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds, A549&#8197;s (human lung adenocarcinoma cells) and HUVECs, as a model of toxicity, were used in MTT assay. The outcomes disclosed for 6&#8208;CO2Me and a N&#8208;alkyl triazole derivatives were of potent antiproliferative effect against A549&#8197;s (IC50 = 4.7 and 14.9&#8197;&#956;M, respectively) with slight cytotoxicity in HUVECs. Morphological study was conducted by AO/EB dual staining, indicated hydrochloride 6&#8208;CO2Me derivative was capable of inducing apoptosis of A549 cells.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three-component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid-state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual-State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O-alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid-state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X-ray data of compounds &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid-state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

The Front Cover illustrates the separation of isomeric manganese oxo&#8208;intermediates by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The manganese oxo&#8208;intermediates are generated during the epoxidation of alkenes by iodosylbenzene, catalyzed by manganese porphyrin cage complexes. These intermediates are formed either on the inside or outside of the cage complex. Cover designed by Quentin Duez. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. A. A. W. Elemans, J. Roithov&#225;, R. J. M. Nolte et&#8197;al.

Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

A straightforward protocol for 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;fused dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepines is effectively established through KI/TBHP&#8208;promoted [3+2] annulation between dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepine&#8208;imines and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones under mild conditions.

Abstract
The KI/TBHP (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) promoted [3+2] annulation between dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepine&#8208;imines (DBO&#8208;Imines) and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones under mild conditions has been developed, affording a direct and high atom&#8208;economical preparation for tetracyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;fused dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepines (DBOs) in good to excellent yields. This procedure could tolerate a wide range of functional groups and could also be conveniently conducted on a gram&#8208;scale reaction, even in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The produced 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;fused DBOs could be easily converted into biologically interesting 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;fused DBOs under the action of NBS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KI/TBHP (&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide) promoted [3+2] annulation between dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;b,f&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]oxazepine-imines (DBO-Imines) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosylhydrazones under mild conditions has been developed, affording a direct and high atom-economical preparation for tetracyclic 1,2,4-triazoline-fused dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;b,f&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]oxazepines (DBOs) in good to excellent yields. This procedure could tolerate a wide range of functional groups and could also be conveniently conducted on a gram-scale reaction, even in a one-pot fashion. The produced 1,2,4-triazoline-fused DBOs could be easily converted into biologically interesting 1,2,4-triazolo-fused DBOs under the action of NBS (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bromosuccinimide).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Chlorodifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes by a Hypervalent Iodine EDA Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex enabling direct chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes is described. This method provides the privileged moiety with mild conditions across a broad range of functional groups and bioactive scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions and key control experiments are reported as well. The core EDA complex is studied spectroscopically, enabling further synthetic applications in the future.







Abstract
A novel EDA complex comprised of a bis(chlorodifluoroacetoxy)iodoarene and 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene is described, which enables the direct radical C(sp2)&#8722;H chlorodifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes under monochromatic visible&#8208;light irradiation. The procedure is mild, operationally simple, and utilizes commercially available reagents. The developed conditions demonstrate compatibility with a host of commonly encountered functionalities and biologically relevant scaffolds, whilst showcasing the post&#8208;functionalization capabilities of the &#8722;CF2Cl moiety. Various mechanistic studies were performed to explore the EDA complex and radical generation pathway.

         <title>6&#8208;Methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one Based Compounds as BRD9 Epigenetic Reader Binders: A Rational Combination of in silico Studies and Chemical Synthesis</title>

Five 6&#8208;methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one based compounds were here selected, efficiently synthesized, and identified as new BRD9 binders. These compounds selectively bind BRD9 epigenetic reader in the low micromolar range.







Abstract
6&#8208;methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one&#8208;based compounds were here identified and synthesized as novel binders of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 9 (BRD9) epigenetic reader. Accounting a fast and efficient synthetic route aimed to easily obtain differently 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;disubstituted 6&#8208;methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one derivatives, a virtual library of synthesizable items was built and submitted to molecular docking experiments. Based on two 3D structure&#8208;based pharmacophore models recently developed by us on BRD9, 16 compounds were selected and synthesized, using mild conditions with good yields in relatively short reaction times. Among them, 14, 16, 18, 22, and 26 emerged as the most potent compounds of these series, able to bind BRD9 at the low micromolar range of concentrations. These molecules also showed a promising selective behavior when tested against BRD4 bromodomain. These results highlighted the quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one chemical core as a valuable scaffold for developing promising BRD9 binders.

         <title>Improved Synthesis Strategy for N&#8208;Methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane Nucleic Acids (MOANAs)</title>

Condensation with 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde provides easy access to a protected phosphoramidite building block of (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol, used as the backbone scaffold in the synthesis of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane nucleic acids (MOANAs). The resulting N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane moiety is stable under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis but readily hydrolyzed afterwards. Stability of the protection can be adjusted predictably by changing the substituent on the phenyl ring.







Abstract
Dependence of the hydrolysis rate of a series of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinanes on the Hammett substituent constant of the substituent of the phenyl ring was determined, yielding a reaction constant &#961;=&#8722;1.40&#177;0.05. Based on this information, 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde was selected as a protecting group for a new (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol phosphoramidite building block. The yield of the preparation of this building block as well as its coupling in automated oligonucleotide synthesis were greatly improved compared to the method reported previously. The 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazine protection persisted throughout the synthesis of short oligonucleotides but was rapidly removed when the oligonucleotides were released from solid support and dissolved in water.

         <title>Direct Functionalization of Lithium Phosphine Oxides Bearing an Alkyne Chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective hydrophosphorylation of carbonyl bonds was developed via a lithium phosphine oxide intermediate, resulting in intermolecular addition to an aldehyde, instead of the intramolecular cyclisation pathway. Valuable alkynyl phosphorated alcohols were obtained in good yields and moderate diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized alkynyl phosphine oxides is described. The current approach is based on the activation of the phosphorus&#8722;hydrogen bond (P&#8722;H bond) of a secondary phosphine oxide. After the deprotonation step using n&#8208;butyllithium, the in&#8208;situ generated LiP(O)RR&#8217; undergoes further condensation with a wide variety of electrophiles, and without a cyclisation step into the alkyne as a side reaction. In particular, the addition to aldehydes proceeds quickly and gives access to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy phosphine oxides, with a diastereoselectivity rate up to 80/20.

&lt;p&gt;Selective hydrophosphorylation of carbonyl bonds was developed via a lithium phosphine oxide intermediate, resulting in intermolecular addition to an aldehyde, instead of the intramolecular cyclisation pathway. Valuable alkynyl phosphorated alcohols were obtained in good yields and moderate diastereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient synthesis of functionalized alkynyl phosphine oxides is described. The current approach is based on the activation of the phosphorus&#8722;hydrogen bond (P&#8722;H bond) of a secondary phosphine oxide. After the deprotonation step using &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium, the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; generated LiP(O)RR&#8217; undergoes further condensation with a wide variety of electrophiles, and without a cyclisation step into the alkyne as a side reaction. In particular, the addition to aldehydes proceeds quickly and gives access to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy phosphine oxides, with a diastereoselectivity rate up to 80/20.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

         <title>NIS&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;H Oxidation of 2&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Benzamides

A new N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidation to construct C&#8722;O bonds has been developed. The reaction differs in the construction of the C&#8722;N bond from the classic and modified Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we describe the N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated benzyl sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted benzamide derivatives. This Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) type reaction involving intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;O bond formation differs from the construction of the C&#8722;N bond in the classic and modified HLF reactions. This reaction proceeded smoothly via 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer of N&#8208;centered radicals directly afforded by in&#8197;situ N&#8722;I bond generation, providing iminoisobenzofuran derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with exclusive chemoselectivity.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Synthesis of Polyhydroxylated Indolizidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyhydroxylated indolizidines from the class of iminosugars alkaloids have captivated attention as they retain broad spectrum of biological effects. Recent syntheses of natural indolizidine iminosugars employing chiral pool or enantioselective approach are discussed. Synthesis and inhibitory activity of new representatives is also included.







Abstract
Since their discovery, polyhydroxylated indolizidines have been the focus of attention for both biologists and synthetic chemists. They are classified as iminosugar alkaloids: nitrogen&#8208;based carbohydrate mimetics that are potent inhibitors of glycosidases. Many discovered glycosidase inhibitors were found to possess biological activity, and they are therefore considered to be potential therapeutics in the treatment of various diseases such as viral infections, diabetes, or cancer. Not surprisingly, the interest in the preparation of these substances has been enormous. This review presents the latest developments in the synthesis of naturally occurring polyhydroxylated indolizidines and their synthetic enantiomers. In addition, the synthesis of several novel polyhydroxylated indolizidines, which were discovered to have inhibitory activity, is reported.

         <title>Computational Comparison of the Stability of Iminium Ions and Salts from Enals and Pyrrolidine Derivatives (Aminocatalysts)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal exchange reactions between chiral secondary amines and iminium ions, as predicted by DFT calculations at the M06&#8208;2X level, are compared for the first time. The order of stability for these iminium species is thus established. The relative concentrations of the possible iminium ions in different media, if an enal is treated with two or more aminocatalysts, may be anticipated.







Abstract
The energies of CH2=CH&#8722;CH=N+R2+HNR*2&#8594;CH2=CH&#8722;CH=N+R*2+HNR2 reactions (exchange of propenal between two secondary amines) and of similar equilibria with cinnamaldehyde have been calculated and compared. Iminium ions from pyrrolidines with substituents that can help stabilize the positive charge are especially stable in the gas phase, as expected, whereas in very polar solvents the predicted order of stability (of their iminium ions) is: O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilylprolinol&gt;pyrrolidine&gt;O&#8208;methylprolinol&gt;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrrolidine&gt;J&#248;rgensen&#8208;Hayashi catalyst&gt;2&#8208;tritylpyrrolidine&gt;N,N&#8208;dimethylprolinamide&gt;trimethylsilyl prolinate&gt;3&#8208;triflamidopyrrolidine&gt;methyl prolinate&#8811;MacMillan&#8208;1 catalyst&gt;MacMillan&#8208;2 catalyst. When ion pairs such as iminium tetrafluoroborates, in CHCl3, are compared, the order is similar. These data can be used to predict which iminium salts may predominate when two or more secondary amines and appropriate acids are added to conjugated carbonyl compounds.

     alt="Computational Comparison of the Stability of Iminium Ions and Salts from Enals and Pyrrolidine Derivatives (Aminocatalysts)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal exchange reactions between chiral secondary amines and iminium ions, as predicted by DFT calculations at the M06-2X level, are compared for the first time. The order of stability for these iminium species is thus established. The relative concentrations of the possible iminium ions in different media, if an enal is treated with two or more aminocatalysts, may be anticipated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energies of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&#8722;CH=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+HNR*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&#8722;CH=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;R*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+HNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactions (exchange of propenal between two secondary amines) and of similar equilibria with cinnamaldehyde have been calculated and compared. Iminium ions from pyrrolidines with substituents that can help stabilize the positive charge are especially stable in the gas phase, as expected, whereas in very polar solvents the predicted order of stability (of their iminium ions) is: &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyldiphenylsilylprolinol&amp;gt;pyrrolidine&amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylprolinol&amp;gt;2-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylpyrrolidine&amp;gt;J&#248;rgensen-Hayashi catalyst&amp;gt;2-tritylpyrrolidine&amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylprolinamide&amp;gt;trimethylsilyl prolinate&amp;gt;3-triflamidopyrrolidine&amp;gt;methyl prolinate&#8811;MacMillan-1 catalyst&amp;gt;MacMillan-2 catalyst. When ion pairs such as iminium tetrafluoroborates, in CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are compared, the order is similar. These data can be used to predict which iminium salts may predominate when two or more secondary amines and appropriate acids are added to conjugated carbonyl compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cupric Halide&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective Intramolecular Cis&#8208;Addition to Construct (Z)&#8208;Chloro(bromo)benzo[c,d]indoles</title>

         <dc:description>
In this paper, we have developed tunable copper&#8208;promoted stereoselective intramolecular cis&#8208;addition annulation reactions for controllable synthesis of (Z)&#8208;chloro(bromo)benzo[c,d]indoles under mild conditions. A novel fluorescent molecule with AIE properties was constructed by Suzuki coupling reaction using (Z)&#8208;bromobenzo[c,d]indole 3&#8201;b as the starting material, and its optical properties was investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and efficient method for one pot synthesis of polysubstituted (Z)&#8208;halobenzo[c,d]indoles from 8&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives using CuCl2 and CuBr2 as the halogenated reagents has been developed. In this protocol, both (Z)&#8208;chloro and bromobenzo[c,d] indole derivatives can be obtained in moderate to good yields by copper halide&#8208;promoted stereoselective intramolecular cis&#8208;addition annulation reactions. A novel fluorescent molecule with AIE properties was constructed via Suzuki coupling reaction and its optical properties was investigated, which made them possible candidates for optoelectronic conjugated materials.

         <title>Catalytic Isomerization of Unprotected Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Lewis Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of C5&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) to more Lewis basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including unprotected mNHO, MIC, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange reactions of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.







Abstract
Recently, novel C5&#8208;position&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids during experiments. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.

Bis(pyrazolyl)borate Cu(I) complex catalysts with intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu weak interaction as a &#8220;switch&#8221; have been applied in catalytic carbene/nitrene transfer and addition to C=C bonds. The catalytic cyclopropanation/aziridination reaction demonstrates wide substrate scope, high yields, and selectivity.







Abstract
Bis(pyrazolyl)borate complexes [BBN(pzR)2]Cu(I) were evaluated as catalysts in the reaction of carbene/nitrene transfer and addition to C=C bonds of a wide range of aromatic, heterocyclic and aliphatic olefins. The complexes exhibit high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in both processes.

Abstract
The article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the applicability of cooperative [M]&#8208;/Organo&#8208;catalytic systems in aerobic Si&#8722;H&#8208;functionalization. A thorough kinetic study allowed us to identify two &#8220;complementary&#8221; catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant [M]&#8208;catalysts and inexpensive commercially available organic catalysts. The first system, Co(OAc)2/N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide, made it possible to oxidize a Si&#8722;H&#8208;group to a Si&#8722;OH&#8208;group in a wide range of monomers, including previously unknown ones, that dramatically differ in their reactivity. However, this system failed in the case of oligomeric and polymeric substrates. This problem was solved by application of the Cu(OAc)2/N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide system. A wide potential for gram&#8208;scale (50&#8211;100&#8197;g) preparation of Si&#8722;OH&#8208;containing products with molecular architectures of different complexity was revealed using the established &#8220;substrate&#8208;reactivity&#8208;catalytic system&#8221; relationship. In particular, previously unknown types of dumbbell&#8208;shaped and graft polymers were synthesized using alkoxysilanols.

         <title>Cyclic Triimidazoles as Stabilizers for Gene Promoter and Human Telomeric DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cyclic triimidazole derivatives with methylpiridinium or guanyl hydrazone moieties exhibit high stabilization potential and binding affinity to h&#8208;telo, c&#8208;myc, and c&#8208;kit2 G&#8208;quadruplexes







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a small series of cyclic triimidazole derivatives functionalized with methylated pyridine or guanidine moieties is reported. These compounds were tested for their ability to bind to G&#8208;quadruplexes from both telomeric and oncogene promoter sequences. Some of them exhibited high affinity and effective G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;stabilizing properties. Overall, these compounds may represent useful leads for developing more potent and selective analogues.

         <title>A Solid Alkylation: Highly Recyclable, Flow Chemistry&#8208;Ready, Resin&#8208;Supported Thioimidazoliums Alkylate Sulfur&#8208;Centered Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild alkylating agent can be immobilized and used to alkylate thiols and nitrogenous heterocycles, with low to poor ability to alkylate amines, and no reactivity against water or alcohols. Once depleted, the alkylating agent can be regenerated by treatment with alkyl iodide. The immobilized agent can be incorporated into a small flow reactor, allowing for increased ease of use.







Abstract
A series of readily regenerable thioimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids, which can transfer alkyl groups to nucleophiles, are immobilized on crosslinked polystyrene beads. Different alkyl groups can be loaded onto the resin, highlighting the tunability of the material. The efficiency of these materials is demonstrated by their screening against a series of nucleophiles, showing a particular preference for thiols. Finally, these materials were evaluated for use under continuous flow conditions. The flexibility, ease of use, safety, and recyclability of these alkylating resins shows promise for their use in large scale and automated applications.

         <title>Fluorescent Probe for the Monitoring of Plasma Membrane Hydration</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 35, September 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fluorescent probes are reported to detect plasma membrane hydration in cells under homeostatic and apoptotic conditions through an integrated dual&#8208;color bioanalytical protocol.







Abstract
Subcellular microenvironment plays a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis being hydration an essential parameter to monitor the variations of lipid organization in biological membranes. Fluorescent microenvironment&#8208;sensitive probes are stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules and able to change their fluorescence profile according to the microenvironment properties (polarity, hydration, microviscosity and tension). Here we present an organic fluorescent probe, NPM&#8208;1, as a new microenvironmental dye with selective plasma membrane localization in live cells. Using high&#8208;resolution confocal microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, we explored the hydration and polarity variations during the formation of apoptotic bodies in real time. To have a clear understanding of the cell microenvironment variations, an analogue polarity probe able to localize the cytosol and nucleoli was also synthetized, CellPol&#8208;1. Then, we were able to monitor the subcellular hydration variations during the apoptotic body dynamics.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroarylation of allenes leads to the selective formation of highly valuable allylic or vinylic structures through C&#8722;C bond formation. In this frame, transition metal&#8208;based catalysts have been broadly employed. This review highlights this topic, discussing advantages, limitations and mechanistic aspects of the related methods over the four last decades.







Abstract
The intermolecular transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydroarylation of allenes has been widely explored since the early 1980s. This reaction allows the selective access to high&#8208;value allylic or vinylic motifs through the formation of C&#8722;C bonds. In this frame, arenes (ArH), which are employed without any pre&#8208;functionalisation, represent one of the most used families of aryl sources. Organoboronic derivatives (acids ArB(OH)2 and esters ArB(OR)2) constitute alternative, accessible and generally more reactive coupling partners, while aryl halides (ArX) are a third, less used type of aryl source. Whereas gold&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts are often used with arenes and aryl boronic derivatives, respectively, as aryl sources, a wide range of other transition metals have also been employed. Experimental and theoretical studies have often been reported, thus affording mechanistic insights and allowing to suggest catalytic cycles.

In this frame, arenes (ArH), which are employed without any pre-functionalisation, represent one of the most used families of aryl sources. Organoboronic derivatives (acids ArB(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and esters ArB(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) constitute alternative, accessible and generally more reactive coupling partners, while aryl halides (ArX) are a third, less used type of aryl source. Whereas gold- and palladium-based catalysts are often used with arenes and aryl boronic derivatives, respectively, as aryl sources, a wide range of other transition metals have also been employed. Experimental and theoretical studies have often been reported, thus affording mechanistic insights and allowing to suggest catalytic cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and mesophase properties of triphenylene dimers linked through linear and bent alkyne&#8208;aryl&#8208;alkyne bridges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nematic mesophase formation in disc&#8208;like systems remains relatively rare compared to higher&#8208;order columnar organisation, but it is observed in some rigid dimeric systems. Mesophase formation in rigid discotic dimers has been sequentially probed and is shown to be predictably controlled through structural choice of the bridge. Moderately bent bridges shorten the discogen separation and reduce conformational freedom. Severely bent dimers (1,2&#8208;phenylene bridge) show no mesophases but, as the angle is widened, columnar and nematic organisation becomes possible and progressively more favoured. The linear arrangement gives the most stable columnar mesophase and a narrow&#8208;range nematic mesophase.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dealkylation of Benzamides in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;dealkylation reactions of benzamides occur naturally in living organisms but chemical methods remain poorly developed. So far, light&#8208;induced variants of these processes have been restricted to amides containing secondary N&#8208;alkyl groups or required pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting material. Here, we present a direct, controllable N&#8208;dealkylation of tertiary and secondary benzamides possessing primary alkyl substituents at N&#8208;atom. The developed strategy operates in aqueous environment under mild conditions involving either blue LEDs or sunlight irradiation. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate two&#8208;step oxidation and the intermediacy of radicals at &#945;&#8208;position to N&#8208;atom. Selectivity in N&#8208;dealkylation of homo&#8208; and heterosubstituted tertiary benzamides is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Rich Carbon Dots as Novel Nano&#8208;Aminocatalytic Platforms in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From N&#8208;containing molecular precursors to amine&#8208;rich CDs: a journey into sustainable and green opportunities for aminocatalytic methodologies. The analysis of the most explicative examples provides a panoramic view on the progress toward the preparation and application of amine&#8208;bearing CDs as catalysts for transformations of synthetical importance.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective metal&#8208;free catalytic systems, which can drive value&#8208;added organic transformations in environmentally benign solvents (for instance, water), is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be harmless, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and potentially recyclable. In this context, amine&#8208;rich carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as promising nano&#8208;catalytic platforms. These nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoparticles, which show dimensions smaller than 10&#8197;nm, generally consist of carbon cores that are surrounded by shells containing numerous amino groups. In recent years, organic chemists have used these surface amines to guide the design of several synthetic methodologies under mild operative conditions. This Concept highlights the recent advances in the synthesis of amine&#8208;rich carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis, including forward&#8208;looking opportunities within this research field.

         <dc:description>The efficient investigation of biological membranes is a constant demand in chemical biology. Several families of near infra&#8208;red (NIR) dyes have been already studied for the selective staining of a plethora of biological structures, macro and supramolecular assemblies.&#160; In this context, a small library of symmetrical and unsymmetrical NIR squaraine dyes have been synthetized and investigated as fluorescent probes to stain the lipid bilayer membrane in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as cell membrane model. The hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic character of the NIR dyes has been modulated by introducing carboxylic moieties on the aromatic core, as well as by varying the length of the alkyl chains used in the quaternarization of the indolenine nitrogen. The photophysical properties and the kinetic of the insertion into different LUVs models have been analysed with respect to the probe structures. The discussed results represent versatile key data to support the design of new NIR sensors for bioimaging.</dc:description>

Scalable and diastereoselective synthetic approach to 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;1&#8208;yl derivatives by the difluorocyclopropanation of (2&#8208;methylenecyclopropyl)methanol and further chemical modifications were disclosed. Structural features, pKa, logP, and aqueous solubility of the products were established and compared with those of non&#8208;fluorinated and 2,2&#8208;difluorinated analogs, as well as monocyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.







Abstract
Functionalized 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;1&#8208;yl derivatives are proposed as promising building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Scalable, efficient, and diastereoselective approach to their preparation via the difluorocyclopropanation of (2&#8208;methylenecyclopropyl)methanol is developed. Stability of the title scaffolds towards common reaction conditions is confirmed by a series of typical functional group transformations. Physicochemical characteristics (pKa, logP, and aqueous solubility) and structural features of the key 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;yl derivatives are established and compared with those of non&#8208;fluorinated analog, 2,2&#8208;difluorinated isomer, as well as monocyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Reduction of Heteroallenes Through Hydroboration: Amide/Thioamide/Selenoamide Bond Construction and C=X (X= O, S, Se) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) stabilized aluminum dihydride, [LAlH 2 ; (L = {(ArNH)(ArN)&#8211; C=N&#8211;C=(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar = 2,6&#8208; Et 2 &#8208;C 6 H 3 )] ( I ) catalyzed chemoselective hydroboration of heteroallenes such as carbodiimide (CDI)s, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and isoselenocyanates is reported. A wide range of heteroallenes, including electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups, experience hydroboration to obtain selectively N&#8208;boryl amide, N&#8208;borylaminal, and N&#8208;boryl methyl amine products. More importantly, a single sustainable molecular aluminum&#8208;based catalyst effectively catalyzes CDIs, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and isoselenocyanates into formamidines, formamides, thioformamides, and selenoformamides, respectively. Further, heteroallene substrates undergo hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydrodesulfurization (HDS), and hydrodeselenization (HDSe) reactions leading to N&#8208;boryl methyl amines. In addition, a series of control and kinetic experiments indicate that the aluminum hydride species are essential for all partial and complete reduction steps and breaking the C=X (X = O, S, and Se) bonds in heteroallenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Indirect C&#8211;F Activation of 3&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a catalyst&#8208;free method for indirect C&#8211;F activation of a perfluorinated side chain in C (3) position of 1 H &#8208;indoles with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields under mild reaction conditions. It allows the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#945; &#8208;CF 2 &#8208;group of the perfluorinated chain. By adapting this approach, it is also possible to modify 3&#8208;perfluorobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1 H &#8208;indole to generate privileged structures for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Deep Eutectic Solvent like choline chloride/glycerol (1:2 mol mol  &#8211;1  ) proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95% yield. Of note, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Carbon Nitrides as Photoactive Supports in Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysis for Synthetic Purposes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the field of dual photocatalysis has become an increasingly popular tool for the functionalization of organic substrates under mild operative conditions. Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs), where the metal atoms are stabilized by means of properly structured photoactive supports, are currently one of the frontiers of this research field. To this end, Carbon Nitrides (CNs) have emerged as ideal two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting supports, capable of stabilizing single metal sites (for instance: nickel, iron, among other) through nitrogen&#8208;rich structures. This Concept highlights the recent advances in the synthesis of carbon nitride&#8208;based SACs and their applications in light&#8208;driven dual&#8208;catalytic processes, also providing forward&#8208;looking opportunities within this research area.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photoinduction is a means to generate cyanoalkyl radicals from cycloketone oxime derivatives. While the reported protocols usually require photocatalysts, transition metal compounds and/or other additives, we herein report an additive&#8208;free alternative for the generation of cyanoalkyl radicals through photoinduced single electron transfer from dichalcogenides to cyclobutanone oxime esters, resulting in chalcogen&#8208;containing nitriles.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;H Alkylation of Glycine Derivatives:&#160;A Straightforward Strategy for Diverse &#945;&#8208;Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural amino acids are important scaffolds for novel drug candidates, and especially  &#945;  &#8208;alkyl amino acids have emerged as a valuable variant. This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products and biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical&#8208;based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site&#8208; and region&#8208;specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex  &#945;  &#8208;unnatural amino acids via radical&#8208;mediated  &#945;  &#8208;C&#8208;H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade&#8217;s development of radical&#8208;based  &#945;  &#8208;C&#8208;H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural  &#945;  &#8208;amino acids.

This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products and biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical-based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site- and region-specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex  &#945;  -unnatural amino acids via radical-mediated  &#945;  -C-H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade&#8217;s development of radical-based  &#945;  -C-H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural  &#945;  -amino acids. The advantages, current limitations, and perspectives of glycine-based unnatural amino acid synthesis are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protection and Transformation of Natural Products within Aqueous Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products are central to the development of the&#160;organic synthesis field and continue to attract immense interest due&#160;to their biological activity and wide industrial use. However, many of&#160;them suffer from poor aqueous solubility, instability under certain&#160;conditions, or hold complex composition, limiting natural product&#160;investigations and difficulting their selective derivatization. Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) show great promise as molecular platforms&#160;that can help solubilize in water, preserve, or transform natural&#160;products&#160; upon binding. This contribution features recent examples of&#160;MOCs that encapsulate naturally occurring compounds and synthetic&#160;congeners in water and protect them from photodegradation or&#160;hydrolysis. Specific cases pertaining to the use of these cages as&#160;molecular vessels in aqueous solution to carry out stoichiometric or&#160;catalytic conversions relevant to the selective derivatization of natural&#160;substances are highlighted. This review thus aims to provide an&#160;overview of the possibilities of using MOC constructs to bring about new properties and reactivity on natural products and offer new&#160;methodological insights into their operation for enhancing their activity&#160;and the engineering of further aqueous applications involving naturally&#160;produced compounds, synthetic derivatives, and biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical 1,3&#8208;Acyl Shifts in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. The discussed applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts in total syntheses highlight (i) the stereospecific reaction mechanism, (ii) the tolerance of versatile protecting groups, and (iii) their role in putative biosyntheses.







Abstract
Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. This review highlights applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts to elegant, partly biomimetic total syntheses of natural products by discussing the underlying photochemical equilibrium.

         <title>Domino Reactions via Recursive Anionic Cascades: Advantage Nitronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recursive Anionic Cyclization (RAC) continues to proliferate as a mechanistically distinct domino strategy. Deployment of nitroalkanes as a source of recursive carbanions has created a niche operating space for generating molecular complexity and diversity. This new corollary i.e. recursive nitronate cyclization is the basis of a domino [5C + 1C] cyclization strategy wherein nitroalkanes act as one&#8208;carbon lynchpin, providing rapid access to topologically intriguing, densely functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocycles embodying multiple chiral centers with regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Extension to aromatic domains, particularly via benzannulation reactions, has further consolidated the operating space. While leveraging the functional versatility of nitro group for post&#8208;domino modifications, such endeavors have culminated in total synthesis of diverse natural products. An incisive analysis of recursive nitronate cyclizations and their emergent potentials is delineated in this review. It is hoped that this focused narrative will enthuse and draw new practitioners to the arena to advance the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; Multicomponent Reaction Catalysed by Reusable Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acidic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present work, the use of Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquids (BAIL) as catalysts for Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) multicomponent reactions was systematically investigated. A series of four 1&#8208;(butyl&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonic)&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium salts bearing different anions was easily prepared and screened as acidic catalysts for this transformation. The best reaction conditions were stablished as 20 mol% of catalyst [(SO  3  H)  4  C  4  C  1  Im][OTf] in refluxing EtOH or MeOH under conventional heating and in sealed tube at 150  o  C for 1&#8208;3 hours under microwave heating, affording a series of sixteen imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles in moderate to excellent yields (42&#8208;93%). The homogeneous BAIL catalyst could be recycled and reused in four consecutive reaction cycles, despite of a laborious recovery procedure employed. This approach represents the first example of a task&#8208;specific reusable homogeneous&#160;Br&#248;nsted acidic catalyst in GBB reactions and opens new opportunities for the exploration of acidic ionic liquid phases as catalysts for this fascinating multicomponent reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization Strategies Using Imide Derivatives for the Synthesis of Polycyclic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the structures of some active alkaloids isolated from frogs and other natural sources. It also shows some Colombian and Latin American native frogs from which certain of those alkaloids are isolated. Colombia and Brazil are the two countries with the most abundant diversity of frog species, some of them critically endangered. Chemical synthesis is a powerful alternative to the exploitation of natural resources and can serve to protect menaced frog species. This review gives details on the strategic cyclization method to access such alkaloids. The cover has been designed by using photos &#8220;Black&#8208;legged dart frog&#8221; by Johan Fredriksson, &#8220;Dyeing dart frog&#8221; by Freetoast, and &#8220;Kokoe Poison Dart Frog&#8221; by Thomas Ruedas, published under license CC BY&#8208;SA 3.0.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.

         <title>We Need to Talk about Kekul&#233;: The 150th Anniversary of the Benzene Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2022 is a more appropriate year than 2015 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Kekul&#233; benzene structure, for in 1865 Kekul&#233; did not propose the familiar hexagonal 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene formulation. Why did he not?







Abstract
Although the paper published by Kekul&#233; in 1865 is generally accepted as the seminal document regarding the elucidation of the structure of benzene, it was not for another seven years that Kekul&#233; introduced a &#8220;collision theory&#8221; which, in his view, made the 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene formulation at last acceptable. 2022 is therefore an appropriate year to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his proposal. The present Perspective focusses in particular on how Kekul&#233;&#8217;s mind has evolved during that short period of time. After a short introduction, followed by a historical note about the emergence of aromatic chemistry and the role of Kekul&#233; as founder of structural organic chemistry, this Perspective discloses in three chapters the step&#8208;by&#8208;step unveiling of the 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene structure and focusses on Kekul&#233;&#8217;s own dubiety about this formula. Eventually, in 1872 Kekul&#233;&#8217;s benzene saga is completed in the article in which he discloses his final theory on the structure of benzene.

     alt="We Need to Talk about Kekul&#233;: The 150th Anniversary of the Benzene Structure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 is a more appropriate year than 2015 to celebrate the 150&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the Kekul&#233; benzene structure, for in 1865 Kekul&#233; did not propose the familiar hexagonal 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene formulation. Why did he not?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the paper published by Kekul&#233; in 1865 is generally accepted as the seminal document regarding the elucidation of the structure of benzene, it was not for another seven years that Kekul&#233; introduced a &#8220;collision theory&#8221; which, in his view, made the 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene formulation at last acceptable. 2022 is therefore an appropriate year to celebrate the 150&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of his proposal. The present Perspective focusses in particular on how Kekul&#233;&#8217;s mind has evolved during that short period of time. After a short introduction, followed by a historical note about the emergence of aromatic chemistry and the role of Kekul&#233; as founder of structural organic chemistry, this Perspective discloses in three chapters the step-by-step unveiling of the 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene structure and focusses on Kekul&#233;&#8217;s own dubiety about this formula. Eventually, in 1872 Kekul&#233;&#8217;s benzene saga is completed in the article in which he discloses his final theory on the structure of benzene. In the last section, a short review is presented on the later quest for a fully symmetric single-formula representation of benzene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of a Pyrrolizidinone&#8208;Based hNK1 Antagonist through Reductive Ring Contraction of a Six&#8208;Membered Cyclic Nitronate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise 7&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of MSD&#8217;s potent hNK  1  antagonist containing a pyrrolizidinone core bearing two fluorine&#8208;substituted aryl groups was developed. The pyrrolizidinone unit was constructed by reductive recyclization of a properly functionalized cyclic nitronate, which was assembled by stereoselective [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of a nitroalkene with a vinyl ether bearing a Whitesell&#8217;s chiral auxiliary group. The configuration of the hNK  1  antagonist, which was previously suggested based on bioactivity data, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The crystal structure features multiple weak interactions involving fluorine atoms that are also found in a complex with the hNK  1  receptor simulated by molecular docking.</dc:description>

         <title>Approach toward Reversal of Chemoselectivity in Catalytic Silylation of Pyranosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is widely recognized that primary hydroxy groups show much higher reactivity than the secondary ones, especially in trialkylsilylation. Actually, DMAP&#8208;catalyzed silylation of unprotected pyranosides gave the 6&#8208;  O  &#8208;silylate exclusively by silylation of the primary C(6)&#8208;OH. On the other hand, catalyst  ent  &#8208;  C1  overcame the general tendency of silylation, and enabled the selective silylation of the secondary C(3)&#8208;OH of two &#946;&#8208;glucopyranosides and a &#946;&#8208;galactopyranoside. Although the yields of the silylation are poor at this stage, this is the first example of selective silylation of the secondary hydroxy group in the presence of the free primary C(6)&#8208;OH of pyranosides under the catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>CONSTRUCTION OF 3,3&#180;&#8208;BICARBAZOLES AND INDOLOCARBAZOLES BY USING VISIBLE LIGHT</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic and mechanistic study of novel iterative double cyclization intramolecular S  RN  1 reactions from diarylamines bearing two aryl halide moieties was carried out. This cyclization affords symmetric and unsymmetric 3,3&#180;&#8208;bicarbazoles and indolocarbazoles compounds in regular to very good yields. The synthetic strategy employed for their preparation was a Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig arylation of anilines followed by an intramolecular S  RN  1 reaction, in the presence of base and visible light, at room temperature. The mechanism is non&#8208;trivial and it was studied using spectroscopy and computational calculations, employing the DFT method, with B3LYP and M06&#8208;2X functionals and 6&#8208;31+G*, def2SVP and def2TZVP as bases and radicals are proposed as intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Functionalization of the Octreotide Peptide Macrocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New octreotide analogs were prepared by replacing the disulfide bond with a functionalized tertiary lactam bridge. The on&#8208;resin approach includes an Ugi multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the simultaneous ring closure and incorporation of lipids, fluorophores and functional groups suitable for the subsequent conjugation to cytotoxic moieties.







Abstract
The replacement of the disulfide bridge by other types of side chain linkages has been a continuous endeavor in the development of cyclic peptide drugs with improved metabolic stability. Octreotide is a potent and selective somatostatin analog that has been used as an anticancer agent, in radiolabeled conjugates for the localization of tumors and as targeting moiety in peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe an on&#8208;resin methodology based on a multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the substitution of the disulfide bond by a tertiary lactam bridge functionalized with a variety of exocyclic moieties, including lipids, fluorophores, and charged groups. Conformational analysis in comparison with octreotide provides key information on the type of functionalization permitting the conformational mimicry of the bioactive peptide.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140 &#176;C within 2&#8208;8 h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N &#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75:25 and 95:5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N &#8208;benzylanilines or N &#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation Based Functionalization of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. The aim is to illustrate the different approaches implemented for the functionalization of the C&#8722;H positions of the furan ring as well as of the aldehyde functional group.







Abstract
Furfural and related compounds are building blocks of industrial interest, obtained from raw biomass. Their use as precursors of basic and fine chemicals has gained increasing attention as a green alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived compounds. Several works have reported the functionalization of furfurals to obtain a wider range of chemicals, opening up new synthetic possibilities and applications, ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Among these works, processes based on C&#8722;H activation are the most attractive ones for their atom economy and the possibility to use non&#8208;activated substrates. This minireview summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. In particular, the transition metal catalyzed functionalization of each bond of the heteroaromatic nucleus of these molecules is systematically discussed, as well as examples of C&#8722;H transformations of the aldehyde function.

         <dc:description>The relative configuration of the marine sesquiterpenoid oxyfungiformin, isolated from the soft coral  Capnella fungiformis  , was confirmed by synthesis using the natural product guaiol as chiral precursor. The absolute configuration of oxyfungiformin could be assigned by combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction and comparison of the values for the specific optical rotation. Oxyfungiformin and a diastereoisomer showed cytotoxic activity in cells originating from cancers of the lung, breast, and cervix.</dc:description>

         <title>NaOH/BEt3 Catalyzed Regioselective Hydroboration of Epoxides with HBpin to Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective hydroboration/hydrolysis of epoxides with pinacolborane to secondary alcohols catalyzed by NaOH/BEt3 was achieved. Glycidyl oxide, styrene oxide and adamantane epoxide underwent facile hydroboration/deprotection to provide secondary alcohols with exclusive selectivity in good to excellent yields. Moreover, the stereochemistry of epoxides could also be well retained and delivered the corresponding secondary alcohols with high optical activity under alkaline catalytic system. Significantly, in this reaction, diverse functional groups can be compatible, including hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive groups, such as carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and halogen.</dc:description>

         <title>The Emerging Promise with O/C&#8208;Glycosides of Important Dietary Phenolic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The health benefits of non&#8208;nutritive polyphenolic compounds present in plant sources and often constituting part of dietary intake, such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, and beverages (coffee/tea) have been well supported by several epidemiological studies, spanning over last few decades. Despite conflicting claims, the advancement beyond traditional understanding that health benefits originate from the antioxidant properties of these polyphenolics by the way of removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), has spurred renewed interest in the recent times. The varied pharmacological properties associated with these polyphenolics and their O&#8208;glycosides from nature have inspired their use as valuable leads for further development and application as therapeutics. This perspective presents a brief overview of important dietary phenolics and their biological properties severing as a lead for ongoing research in their applications for health benefits.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies on the Initially Proposed Structure of Protoaculeine B: Discovery of Neuronally Active Heterotricyclic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report our results in detail on the synthetic studies of the originally proposed structure of protoaculeine B, isolated from a marine sponge. Starting from tryptophan, two candidates of the suitably protected heterotricyclic subunits were stereoselectively synthesized over 8 and 16 steps, respectively. Furthermore, two diastereomeric heterotricyclic amino acids, finally synthesized, were found to be neuroactive: the (9  S  *,11  S  *)&#8208;isomer with natural&#8208;type configuration was hyperactive, whereas diastereomeric (9  S  *,11  R  *)&#8208;isomer was hypoactive upon mice intracerebroventricular injection.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[n]arenes in Action: Recent Applications in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of the last ten years of advances in organic synthesis using calixarenes as organocatalysts. Calixarenes display a three&#8208;dimensional structure of a macrocycle that can be chemically modified to better act as a catalyst. They also are tolerant to aqueous or solvent&#8208;free systems, being recyclable and easy to separate from the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of calix[n]arenes as organocatalysts has increasingly been considered a prime focus due to their adjustable three&#8208;dimensional molecular structure, easy synthesis, and versatile structural modification at the upper and lower edges. For instance, these macromolecules have been described as efficient catalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions, asymmetric Michael addition, esterification and transesterification, dehydration, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and multicomponent reactions. Furthermore, calix[n]arenes also tolerate aqueous or solvent&#8208;free reaction systems and can be supported on solid and/or magnetic particles, showing cost, time and energy savings, easier experimental procedures, and chemical waste reduction.

         <title>Separation of the Thorpe&#8722;Ingold and Reactive Rotamer Effect by Using the Formation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classic, angle dependent Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect in the formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions is presented. Kinetic studies, backed up by SC&#8208;XRD and DFT calculations, reveal a linear correlation of the internal angle &#946; with the rate constant k1. Increased angles result in decreased rate constants and vice versa. The cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines thereby excludes contribution of the reactive rotamer effect towards this cyclization.







Abstract
The geminal dialkyl effect is widely used in organic synthesis to promote cyclization reactions, although the exact origin of its rate enhancement remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate the applicability of this effect for the intramolecular formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions and assign it to angle contractions provided by introduction of sterically demanding substituents. Due to the cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines the acceleration of this ring closure cannot be explained by an increased population of reactive gauche rotamers and therefore agrees with the original Thorpe&#8208;Ingold theory. Furthermore, introduction of strained aliphatic rings resulted in internal angle expansions and were accompanied by a preliminary decrease of rate constants for the investigated aziridinium ion formation. These results lead to a linear correlation between internal angle and relative reaction rate, supported by computational and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data.

         <title>Supramolecular Catalysts for Organic Synthesis: Preparation and Applications of Cyclodextrins and Calixarenes in C&#8208;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions that promote the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are of great importance in organic synthesis, since those transform available, relatively inexpensive, and small organic molecules into the more complex ones. One of the main protocols used for these transformations are cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and due to their versatility and applications, several efforts have been devoted recently into developing catalysts for such reactions. Supramolecular chemistry has become a major player in this field and encompasses approaches that range from the synthesis of intricate complex architectures that may mimic enzymes, the slight structural modification of commercially available scaffolds, or even repurposing highly available materials such as agarose. In this review we discuss the development of supramolecular catalysts for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, focusing mostly on the Suzuki, Heck and Sonogashira reactions promoted by such assemblies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which give N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas by one&#8208;pot addition of alcohols or amines. The rearrangement occurs with complete stereoselectivity via a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic mechanism, affording &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;linked amines depending on the configuration at C&#8208;3 of the carbohydrate.







Abstract
Glycosylamine derivatives are biologically relevant compounds widespread in Nature, but the synthesis of this motif has been little addressed and its access with control of configuration at the anomeric carbon is challenging. Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which can be conveniently trapped by one&#8208;pot nucleophilic addition with alcohols or amines to afford N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas, respectively. The rearrangement follows a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic pericyclic mechanism as illustrated by the stereospecificity of the reaction, with nitrogen being delivered at the anomeric position to the same face from which the oxygen at C&#8208;3 has departed. Thus, glucal and galactal give &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides exclusively while allal furnishes &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides. cis&#8208;Dihydroxylation of the synthesized unsaturated N&#8208;glycosides afford different 1&#8208;aminosugars with good selectivity.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes as Support for Pd Nanoparticles: a Recyclable System for the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were highly functionalized with catechol moieties by means of a simple procedure involving the in&#8208;situ generation of the diazonium salt arising from the reaction between 4&#8208;aminocatechol and isoamyl nitrite. The resulting material was used to immobilize Pd nanoparticles obtaining an active and recyclable catalyst for the Heck reaction between methyl acrylate/styrene and aryl iodides.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes have been covalently functionalized with catechol moieties through the formation of the corresponding aryl radicals obtained by reacting 4&#8208;aminocatechol with isoamyl nitrite. The functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been in turn used to immobilize Pd(II) ions on its surface forming catechol&#8208;Pd complexes, which were reduced to Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so&#8208;obtained hybrid material has been characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This latter technique allowed to estimate the nanoparticle size (5.7&#177;2.8&#8197;nm) whereas a palladium loading of 20.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% has been found by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The carbon nanotube&#8208;catechol&#8208;Pd hybrid was used as catalyst in two C&#8722;C coupling reactions, namely Suzuki and Heck reactions, resulting recyclable for at least 9 times in the latter process. During the reuse Pd nanoparticles increase their dimension to 19.3&#177;11.7&#8197;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were highly functionalized with catechol moieties by means of a simple procedure involving the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; generation of the diazonium salt arising from the reaction between 4-aminocatechol and isoamyl nitrite. The resulting material was used to immobilize Pd nanoparticles obtaining an active and recyclable catalyst for the Heck reaction between methyl acrylate/styrene and aryl iodides.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A calix[4]pyrrole receptor bearing two proximally&#160;  meso  &#8208;  meso  &#160;linking isophthaloyl straps displays open and closed states depending on the calix[4]pyrrole conformation. In the crystal structures and in non&#8208;polar solvent, the calix[4]pyrrole adopts open 1,3&#8208;alternate conformation with straps on the sides. Anion binding triggers a closed state of the receptor providing two types of interactions with an aromatic benzoate guest: hydrogen bonds from the pyrrolic groups and&#160; &#960; &#183;&#183;&#183; &#960;&#160; interactions from the phenyl groups of the straps. Slow exchange dynamics was observed on the NMR timescale indicating that benzoate, acetate and chloride anions, which bind with relatively low affinity get kinetically trapped in the receptor as insects in a Venus flytrap .</dc:description>

The switch in the torquoselectivity is controlled by the nature of the Lewis acid used as promoter. From the four possible stereoisomers, only the two  trans  were observed. The Lewis acids employed were achiral, the diastereoselectivities being dictated by the sulfinyl auxiliary. Density functional theory investigations shed light on the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Polyazaacene and Cyclazaacene Precursors Synthesized by Dehydration Condensation from a Versatile Bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone Unit Having an Anthracene Skeleton</title>

Herein, 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone was used as a versatile compound for synthesizing polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors. This modular strategy provides a novel pathway for generating polyazaacene precursors of varying lengths and cyclazaacene precursors of various sizes for being assessed by the powerful on&#8208;surface chemistry.







Abstract
Azaacenes are acene analogs containing nitrogen atoms in their carbon&#8208;based molecular skeletons and are attracting significant attention because of their potential application in organic electronics. However, polyazaacenes have solubility and stability issues. In this study, we report a modular approach employing 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone (1) as a key compound for &#960;&#8208;extension with commercially available materials to synthesize a series of polytetraazaacene thermal precursors. Exploiting this strategy, tetraazaheptacene, tetraazanonacene, and tetraazaundecacene precursors were successfully synthesized. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the tetraazanonacene precursor can be converted to its corresponding tetraazanonacene in a nitrogen atmosphere. To extend the applicability of this method, compound 1 was also used to synthesize the cyclazaacene precursor at 0.8&#8201;% yield. This approach provides a new perspective for exploring the synthesis of polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors by using a crucial key compound via dehydration condensation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxazole&#8211;Tetrahydropyran Hybrids and Study on Their Antiproliferative Activity Against Human Tumour Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a previously prepared lead compound, a new series of hybrid compounds was prepared and tested against six human tumour cell lines. These new triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids were prepared evaluating the impact of the LogP for the proposed modifications. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil.







Abstract
A series of triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids was synthesized based on a previously reported lead compound with selective antiproliferative activity against human tumour cell lines. The series was prepared to evaluate the impact of LogP and different modifications in the activity, and the new compounds were assayed against A549, HBL&#8208;100, HeLa, SW1573, T&#8208;47D, and WiDr cell lines. Also, the potentiality to be P&#8208;gp substrate was tested. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with the standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil. In silico studies to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM software were also carried out.

The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with standards cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids was synthesized based on a previously reported lead compound with selective antiproliferative activity against human tumour cell lines. The series was prepared to evaluate the impact of LogP and different modifications in the activity, and the new compounds were assayed against A549, HBL-100, HeLa, SW1573, T-47D, and WiDr cell lines. Also, the potentiality to be P-gp substrate was tested. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with the standards cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. In silico studies to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM software were also carried out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Palladium&#8208;Photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of an unactivated C&#8208;H bonds is a highly desirable process in organic chemistry as it gives direct access to many new functional groups in a single step. This process is generally achieved using transition metal catalysts and among the transition metals studied for C&#8208;H activation, palladium plays an important role due to its unique reactivity. Photoredox catalysis has witnessed a huge surge in the last decade, and many new and valuable organic reactions are uncovered periodically. Dual transition metal &#8208; photoredox catalysis on the other hand, has taken organic synthesis to new heights by achieving transformations that were previously not possible or difficult to achieve by both forms of catalysis independently. In this direction, many new dual palladium&#8208;photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization reactions have been reported in the past few years, and it is imperative to summarize these reactions for further developments in this area. We have divided this review into the following subsections: 1. C&#8208;H arylation, 2. C&#8208;H acylation, 3. C&#8208;H heteroatom functionalization, &amp; 4. C&#8208;H olefination.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure &#8211; Bioactivity Relationship in Cyclic Peptoids: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic peptoids display remarkable biological activity thanks to their constitution and functionalization. This Review provides a systematic description of the bioactivities discovered so far, together with a complete structure&#8208;function relationship rationalization. Utilizing a strategic design for the synthesis of cyclic peptoids represents the starting point for further developments of these peptidomimetics as drug candidates.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;substituted glycines oligomers, also known as cyclic peptoids, constitute a promising class of novel peptidomimetics, capable of simulating bioactive effectors with enhanced proteolytical stability and cell permeability as crucial bonuses. The macrocyclic constraint, essential for the induction of stable secondary structures, determines the biomimetic potential of such molecules, which act as antimicrobials, cytotoxic agents, siderophores, glycosidases inhibitors and so on. The bioactivity can be either attributed to the macrocyclic core (especially chelation) or to the side&#8208;chains (when endowed with specific groups or pharmacophores). The structure&#8208;bioactivity correlations emerging for this class of peptidomimetics, based on the study of conformational order and morphology of the backbone architecture, unravel interesting avenues for the rational design of more effective cyclooligomeric biomimics.

         <dc:description>Attempts to synthesize fluorosulfonyl&#8208;substituted pyrazolines by Huisgen reactions (1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions) of dimethyl diazomalonate with ethenesulfonyl fluoride led to the formation of dimethyl (2R*,3S*,4R*)&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxopropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;4&#8208;((fluorosulfonyl)methyl)cyclo&#173;butane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate, a highly substituted cyclobutane derivative, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The mechanism of its formation was elucidated by carrying out the reaction at different temperatures and workup conditions. It is shown that an initial 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition yields a pyrazoline which extrudes nitrogen with formation of 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopropane and dimethyl 2&#8208;(2&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)ethylidene)malonate, the latter of which dimerized during chromatography on silica gel with formation of the isolated cyclobutane.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics through Successive Vinylic/Aromatic C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic/aromatic C&#8722;F bond activation. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of bromodifluoroalkenes with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization afforded 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles bearing a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. Subsequent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;F/C&#8722;H coupling afforded tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacylic heteroaromatics.







Abstract
The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic/aromatic carbon&#8722;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond activation. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of (1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl)biaryls with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization yielded 2&#8208;fluorobenzofurans (indoles) with a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. The obtained 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles underwent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;F/C&#8722;H coupling to yield tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacyclic heteroaromatics. This protocol allowed the synthesis of various substituted benzo&#8208;fused dibenzofurans and carbazoles.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkanone Enolates with Azides in Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Metal&#8208;free Regioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An eco&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free protocol was developed for the regioselective synthesis of densely functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkanone enolates with azides performed in the environmentally responsible choline chloride/urea or choline acetate/urea eutectic mixture. This approach displays a broad substrate scope, straightforwardly furnishing the desired triazoles (including the challenging phenolic derivatives) in yields of up to 98%, while working at room temperature and under aerobic conditions. The practicability of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of some pharmaceutically relevant triazole derivatives carried out via telescoped, one&#8208;pot cycloaddition/reduction processes in the same eutectic mixture without any halfway isolation/purification step of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabing the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#160;of the reaction, selectively leading to  cis  configured&#160;cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (  cis  or  trans  ) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions and Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis: A Convenient Blend</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most recent applications and possibilities of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions on solid phase are reviewed, which is a practical and fast strategy to cover current organic chemistry demands. Remarkably, solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, while more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, like Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions, are valuable tools for accessing libraries of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions have made an enormous impact in the way complex molecules are assembled. The benefits of solid&#8208;phase chemistry soon made this type of reaction applicable to solid&#8208;supported processes. In this review, we report the most recent applications and possibilities of this combination. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, alike more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, Sonogashira, which are valuable tools for accessing libraries of biologically relevant small molecules. Examples proved the validity of solid&#8208;phase transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions as a practical and fast strategy to cover the current organic chemistry demands.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Imidazolium Salt as Dual Lewis Acid and Redox Catalyst for the Aerobic Synthesis of Quinazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low transition temperature mixture formed with &#160;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(methoxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium chloride and iron(III) chloride has proven to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of quinazolines following a sequence of condensation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;oxidation reactions. The protocol is simple and effective for coupling 2&#8208;acylanilines and benzylamines to form nitrogen containing heterocycles with moderate to excellent yields (up to 93%), being possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale. The functionalized imidazolium salt is crucial for the activation of the reagents under solvent&#8208;free conditions, and the presence of iron in the&#160;catalyst mediates the oxidation step with atmospheric oxygen. These features make the presented procedure better, from an environmental point of view, than other processes previously described. For this comparison, different "green" metrics have been used, such as atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, E&#8208;factor and EcoScale.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious Synthesis of a Glycopeptide Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactor design with optimized reaction conditions provides a route for glycopeptides synthesis within minutes by using equimolar quantities of glycosylated amino acids. This enabled the assembly of a proteoglycan&#8208;derived glycopeptide library in a matter of hours.







Abstract
Short proteoglycan fragments are of great importance for biochemical research. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis of such glycopeptides relies on excessive use of glycosylated amino acids, extended reaction times, and additional post&#8208;assembly deprotection protocols. We employed high&#8208;shear mixing for expedient and equimolar O&#8208;glycopeptide assembly. We further developed a stirring&#8208;based deprotection on the solid support, thus completing the synthesis of a glycopeptide library in a minimal amount of time and purification hurdles.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide with high enantiomeric excess was accomplished. The key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a D&#8722;A cyclopropylcabinol, which proceeds with a very high level of stereoinduction. Based on the obtained experimental evidence, a feasible mechanism for the crucial 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization is proposed.

The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide was achieved with high enantiomeric excess. Key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization that proceeds with a very high degree of stereoinduction. The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. Based on these experimental results, the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an SN1 mechanism with high trans&#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation of (i)&#8197;the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an SN2 mechanism and/or (ii)&#8197;a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an SN1&#8208;like mechanism.

New peptidomimetics containing a &#946;2,2&#8208;isoxazoline amino acid, 5&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroisoxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Isox&#8208;&#946;2,2AA), were prepared and studied by NMR and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, inserting R&#8208;Isox&#8208;&#946;2,2AA in short tri&#8208; and hexapeptide models, an unexpected &#945;&#8208;turn&#8208;like motif was observed, thanks to an unprecedented strong H&#8208;bond involving C=N of isoxazoline side chain of &#946;2,2AA.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aryl Lactams by Heck&#8208;Matsuda and Heck&#8208;Mizoroki Arylations of Enelactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective enantioselective arylation of enelactams using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands was accomplished by using arenediazonium salts or aryl iodides. The use of these distinct electrophiles allowed for the synthesis of several enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams in moderate to good yields in enantiomeric ratios of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. A rationale for the enantioselective process was constructed by an extensive investigation using DFT calculations.







Abstract
The chiral aryl lactam nucleus is a common motif present in many bioactive natural products and the development of effective enantioselective methodologies for its preparation is of great interest. In this work, we report the synthesis of several enantioenriched aryl lactams in good yields and enantiomeric ratios using a combined strategy employing arenediazonium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, aryl iodides with electron&#8208;donating substituents, and chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. The chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams were obtained in yields of up to 78&#8201;% and enantiomeric ratios up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands as a viable alternative to the phosphine&#8208;based ligands in the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Mizoroki reactions using aryl iodides. The origins of the enantioselectivity and the full catalytic cycle for the Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation of the enelactams were investigated through DFT calculations.

         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship study onto six different BODIPY photocatalysts was performed towards a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction. The presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core was revealed to be essential for high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at the meso position deteriorated the catalytic performances, consistently with the proposed reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Stereocontrolling Effect of a Single Triisopropylsilyl Group in 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation with thioglucosides with a single triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group at O&#8208;2 is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective when weak nucleophiles (ROH) are used. Glycosylation proceeds along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via glycosyl cation, which is locked in 4H3 conformation with bulky TIPS group in the pseudo&#8208;equatorial position.







Abstract
Glycosylation with phenyl 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;2&#8208;O&#8208;triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective, while the use of 2,3&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS glucosyl donor with benzoyl groups at O&#8208;4 and O&#8208;6 results in the loss of &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity (&#945;/&#946;=3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol with 2&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS substituted glucosyl donors could only be achieved in glucosylation of weak nucleophiles. In this case, the glucosylation seems to proceed along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via the 4H3 conformer of glycosyl cation stabilized by the bulky TIPS group at O&#8208;2.

         <title>A Green Multicomponent Domino Mannich&#8208;Michael Reaction to Synthesize Novel Naphthoquinone&#8208;Polyphenols with Antiproliferative and Antioxidant Activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC50 values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.







Abstract
This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8211;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8211;47.95&#8197;&#956;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.

&lt;p&gt;This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5-fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.

         <title>H&#8208;Bonded Counterion&#8208;Directed Catalysis: Enantioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition to 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones as a Case Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. The addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).







Abstract
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.

         <title>Organocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Terpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of terpenoids: An organocatalytic coupling and annulation methodology was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally complex cedrane scaffolds in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. It represents a highly economical, novel, and green method for the cedrane scaffolds synthesis.







Abstract
Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner. A combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions were used as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes with catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperatures for a few hours. This is a unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.

This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition&#8208;metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Cuneanes through Enantioselective Constitutional Isomerization of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Cubanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Substituted cuneanes were obtained by metal&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubanes and are stable cage&#8208;like hexahedral compounds with C2v symmetry. In this process, the chiral cage&#8208;like hexahedral hydrocarbon in one step. The asymmetric induction was performed using chiral P&#8722;C&#8722;P pincer Pd catalyst. The obtained cuneane will be a novel chiral scaffold.







Abstract
2,6&#8208;Disubstituted cuneane has potential as a p&#8208;disubstituted benzene bioisostere and a novel chiral scaffold. It is a constitutional isomer of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane obtained via a metal&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement. Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6&#8208;disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing C2 symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd&#8208;pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.

Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.







Abstract
A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) were synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment (&#956;0) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (Ea), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;0 and a lowering of the Ea value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8211;30&#8197;kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment.

         <title>Cyclization Strategies Using Imide Derivatives for the Synthesis of Polycyclic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main synthetic strategies to convert cyclic imides into polycyclic amine derivatives are revised. These synthetic routes have been classified according to their key features: N&#8208;acyliminium ions&#8208;based reactions, electrophilic activation of imides, use of strong nucleophiles, radicals&#8208;based methods, and miscellaneous strategies.







Abstract
Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods. This review is not comprehensive. It aims to provide the reader with a selection of representative synthetic strategies available in the area up to date.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

         <title>Biocatalytic Kinetic Resolution to Access Enantiomerically Enriched Dihydropyrimidinone/Thiones through Recognition of a Remote Stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.
