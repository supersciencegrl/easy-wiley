      <title>Structural Diversity using Hyp &#8220;Customizable Units&#8221;: Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Synthesis of Sansalvamide&#8208;Related Antitumoral Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The potential of &#8220;  customizable units  &#8221; to generate structural diversity for biological screenings is highlighted in this  proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept  synthesis of new peptides related to the potent antitumoral Sansalvamide A. Using L&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as customizable unit in a linear parent peptide, an improved procedure for selective peptide modification was developed. A divergent Hyp scission&#8208;reductive amination process was carried out, affording five linear peptides with cationic residues, and remarkably, a  N  &#8208;alkyl moiety that hindered rotation. After two steps (saponification and macrocyclization), sixteen differently  N1  &#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides were obtained. For the first time, the activity of the linear and cyclic compounds was compared. Not only some linear analogs, but also cyclic compounds with scarcely&#8208;studied cationic residues were active against MCF7 breast cancer line. Thus, structural diversity generated from customizable units can be valuable in drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>"On&#8208;resin" disulfide peptide synthesis with methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate</title>
      <dc:description>New methodologies for the construction of full peptide structures with all disulfide bonds on the resin are attractive for the development of solid phase peptide synthesis. Detailed reaction conditions for the on&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation have been investigated using a mild and chemically stable oxidizing reagent, methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe). Monocyclic oxytocin, MCH and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI were synthesized in both semi&#8208;automated and full&#8208;automated protocols. It was found that on&#8208;resin intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Npys&#8208;OMe proceeds with the minimal formation of peptide oligomers by adopting a solvent system with 0.4 M LiCl/DMF. Crude peptides with complete disulfide bond patterns can be obtained in high purity in both protocols. This minimized the RP&#8208;HPLC purification step and the desired peptides were obtained with better yields. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated construction of a bicyclic disulfide peptide on resin with more than 50% purity in Fmoc&#8208;based SPPS. These results suggest that Npys&#8208;OMe is a useful reagent for the disulfide bond formation in automated protocols.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted dithiocarbamates from aldehydes is described. The reaction involves nucleophilic trifluoromethylation, derivatization of the silyloxy&#8208;group with pentafluoropyridine, and substitution of the fluorinated pyridinyloxy group by dithiocarbamate anion.

      <title>The Riveting Chemistry of Poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles Employing Microwave Technique: A Decade Review</title>

On the other side, poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave&#8208;assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles viz., triazole, tetrazole, triazine and tetrazine from the past decade (2010 &#8208; 2020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles is appropriately elucidated, which were tend to be hassled with classical approaches. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.</dc:description>

The reactions proceeded with very high (usually complete)  E  selectivity. The key to obtaining good yields of the cross&#8208;coupling products was the use of sterically hindered carboxylic acid as additive and non&#8208;polar solvent (toluene), in which the starting nitrone exists mainly as  E  isomer.

This protocol is of particular interest in preparing 8&#8208;aldehyde quinolines, which are hard to access before. Both AgOTf and dioxgen played an important role in the reaction. C3&#8208;heterocycle or phenylethylene substituted anthranils could be also employed in the reaction. An interesting esterification of aldehyde was observed.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent developments in deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines</title>
      <dc:description>The amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8208;C bonds and C&#8208;X bonds via C(sp  3  )&#8208;N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or base. In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Sulfonylureas.</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfonylureas are employed in a variety of applications including use as drugs to treat type II diabetes and as plant growth regulators or herbicides. Traditionally, the synthesis of sulfonylureas has been accomplished either by the treatment of sulfamides with isocyanates in the presence of a base&#160;or through sulfonamides conversion into  N  &#8208;sulfonyl isocyanates or  N  &#8208;sulfonyl carbamate derivatives which provide the corresponding sulfonylureas upon treatment with amines. Both the approaches are severely limited by the weak nucleophilicity of sulfamides and by the difficulty in synthesizing and handling isocyanate species. Such a drawback could be mitigated by the emergence of protocols establishing the labile electrophilic functional groups  in situ  so that their coupling with nucleophilic partners takes place one&#8208;pot. Recently, the development of environmentally friendly methods to prepare sulfonylurea containing compounds without using harmful reagents has attracted considerable attention. The aim of the minireview is to explore the different protocols emerged in the literature to generate sulfonylureas giving importance to the reaction mechanisms of crucial synthetic steps.</dc:description>

      <title>Diversified Syntheses of Tetrathia[7]helicenes by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The Front Cover Feature shows the spectacular curved staircase of the Vatican Museums designed by Giuseppe Momo and opened in 1932, as background of our synthetic methodologies aimed to convert atropoisomer species based on benzodithiophenes into chiral helical&#8208;shaped tetrathiahelicenes. The helix staircase recalls the peculiar topology of tetrathiahelicenes conferred by the fixed helical arrangement of their &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. We thank Chiara Elitropi for the illustration and Claudio Ciardi for the background photo of Momo staircase. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Silvia Cauteruccio et&#8197;al..

      <title>On the Origin of Regioselectivity in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucosides</title>
      <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of glucopyranosides has been investigated using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside and methyl carba&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba&#8208;glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen. Subsequent energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and Hirschfeld charge analysis reveal the role of the ring oxygen: it positively polarizes C1/C5 by inductive effects and disfavors any subsequent buildup of positive charge at neighboring carbon atoms, rendering C3 the most favored site for the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was originally developed by Mikami and co&#8208;workers but gives only moderate enantiomeric excesses.

The analysis of the C&#8208;CO2 bond formation transition states with DFT methods shows a preference for outer sphere CO2 insertion, where CO2 can undergo a backside or frontside reaction with the nucleophile. The two ligands that prefer a frontside reaction, StackPhos and tBu&#8208;BOX, display an intriguing stacking interaction between CO2 and an N&#8208;heterocyclic ring of the ligand (imidazole or oxazoline). Our experimental results support the computationally predicted low enantiomeric excesses and highlight the difficulty in developing a highly selective version of this reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinoline ligands improve the classic direct C&#8211;H functionalisation/intramolecular cyclisation of diaryl ethers to dibenzofurans</title>
      <dc:description>The C&#8211;H functionalisation approach to the synthesis of dibenzofurans is hampered by a number of problems. Herein we describe the evolution of a cheap, bench stable quinoline ligand, which obviates most of the current limitations and allows for a high yielding synthesis of a range of valuable dibenzofurans. Dibenzofurans are important motifs in natural products and compounds with wide biological activity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin.

The C13&#8208;C20 segment had been generated via a five&#8208;step sequence starting from heptanoyl chloride. Horner key olefination enabled assembly of the carbon backbone.

      <dc:description>The title nonplanar electron acceptor ( 1 ) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N  ,  N  &#8208;diisobutylaminophenyl&#8208;phenothiazine is a strongly reducing catalyst that allows &#8208;for the first time&#8208; the photoredox catalytic addition of alcohols to alkyl olefins as non&#8208;activated substrates to products with Markovnikov orientation. The irradiation at 365 nm does not require any additional reagent. Using a&#8208;methyl styrene as activated substrate we additionally show that this photoredox catalytic method tolerates other functional groups, including allyl, alkynyl, cyanide and even acid&#8208;labile Boc groups within the substrate scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Allosteric guest binding in chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. The zirconium compound was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displays a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery the cooperativity factors &#945; (= 4K1/K2) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced decarboxylative radical addition reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of peptide substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted to radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Here, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.
