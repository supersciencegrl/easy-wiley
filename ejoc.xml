         <title>Modulating Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Oligothiophenes via Subtle Changes in Donnor &#8208; Acceptor Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligothiophenes varying by their donor&#8208;acceptor sequences and displaying distinct optical and electrochemical properties were synthesized by playing with the different reactivity of &#945; and &#945;&#8217; positions of 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis and electronic properties of oligothiophenes derived from the 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene building block. By exploiting the differential reactivity of thiophene's &#945;&#8208;positions, regioisomeric derivatives were synthesized with varying donor&#8211;acceptor sequences. These derivatives displayed distinct optical and electrochemical characteristics based on the relative positions of cyano acceptor and hexyloxy donor groups. Spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical analyses revealed that substituent placement critically affects electronic properties, such as HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and band gaps. The introduction of alkoxy groups at external &#946;&#8208;sites promoted coupling reactions upon oxidation, leading to polymerization or dimerization. Conversely, cyano groups at these positions stabilized radical cations and dications, suppressing further reactions. These findings offer insights into designing conjugated systems with tunable properties, emphasizing the importance of substituent positioning for optimizing performance.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Alkyne&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition to Access Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was introduced for constructing chiral biaryls using Cu catalytic system facilitated by chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridged box ligand, using dialkynyl diaryls and azides as raw materials. This protocol offers notable advantages: simple operation, mild condition, good functional group tolerance, high yields, and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls are an important class of structural units widely used in natural product synthesis, drug design, and as ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Although significant progress has been made in the synthesis of axially chiral biaryls, some of them are still limited to narrow substrate ranges, low efficiency, and moderate stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a highly efficient route to prepare atropisomeric biaryls with triazole and alkyne modules through the desymmetrization of prochiral dialkynyl diaryls utilizing chiral cyclobutyl&#8208;bridge box ligands in conjunction with copper salts. The process has mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can obtain a wide array of valuable axially chiral biaryl derivatives with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Deuterodichloromethylation of Olefins Using Silacarboxylic Acids as Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed deuterodichloromethylation of olefins was developed to afford deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes in good yields. Readily accessible silacarboxylic acids were employed as halogen&#8208;atom transfer reagents and deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced deuterodichloromethylation of alkenes was developed with readily available and inexpensive deuterochloroform as the deuterodichloromethylation reagent. Silacarboxylic acids, which could generate silyl radicals through efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation, were applied as halogen atom transfer agents. A series of deuterium&#8208;containing gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Photocarboxylation of Arylated 2H&#8208;Azirines Exploiting Continuous Flow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous process for the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles is reported which links the photochemical opening of azirines and the subsequent trapping of the azomethine ylides with CO2 gas. This highlights challenges and solutions when incorporating CO2 as a feedstock material for the photochemical synthesis of small heterocyclic building blocks.







Abstract
A robust and efficient continuous flow set&#8208;up is presented for the orchestrated use of CO2 gas and photochemistry in flow mode. This study explores the catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition between azomethine ylides generated in&#8197;situ from simple 2H&#8208;azirines and CO2. Using UV&#8722;A light (365&#8197;nm) as energy source and CO2 as inexpensive and abundant building block provides an attractive strategy affording isomeric oxazolones which were subsequently aromatised to yield novel oxazole products in a convergent manner. Continuous flow processing substantially improves the reaction performance allowing for the safe exploitation of this intriguing transformation. This enables the effective fixation of CO2 to generate valuable building blocks that can be scaled to gram scale with ease.

         <title>Stereoselective Strategies for the Synthesis of Functionalized Cis&#8208;Hydrindanes in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cis&#8208;hydrindanes have attracted significant interest in the scientific community due to their prevalence in natural products and relevance in medicinal chemistry. This review discusses various synthetic strategies developed since 2000 for constructing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes, with a focus on their application in natural product synthesis and highlighting their importance in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The cis&#8208;hydrindane motif is a bicyclic structure commonly found in many natural products that exhibit significant biological activity. This structural feature is present in a variety of bioactive compounds, particularly terpenoids, steroids, and alkaloids, which are known for their therapeutic potential, including anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Due to its prevalence and biological relevance, the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework has attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists, who have devoted substantial effort toward developing efficient and diverse methods for constructing this important motif. Many of the synthesized cis&#8208;hydrindane compounds have been used as key intermediates or building blocks in the total synthesis of complex natural products. This review provides an overview of strategic approaches for synthesizing functionalized cis&#8208;hydrindanes and its derivatives from 2000 to the present day, focusing on their application in natural product synthesis. By examining the diverse methods and their impact on natural product synthesis, this review will underscore the enduring importance of the cis&#8208;hydrindane framework in both synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (4H)&#8208;Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids, and their Antioxidant Activities using Electron Transfer Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine as potent antioxidants. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC.







Abstract
A novel series of (4H)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones, designated as compounds 5(a&#8211;l), were synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine. This synthesis involved derivatization of amino acids with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by cyclocondensation with aromatic amines using PCl3 and a deep eutectic solvent as both catalyst and solvent. Amide intermediates were first produced via the Schotten&#8208;Baumann reaction. These intermediates then underwent cyclization in the presence of PCl3 and deep&#8208;eutectic solvent, leading to the formation of imidazolones as potent antioxidants. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using several electron transfer&#8208;based assays, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC. Among the tested compounds, compound 5&#8201;i exhibited excellent antioxidant activity compared to the standard reference drugs, ascorbic acid and Trolox.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivations of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.</dc:description>

This molecule has lately gained substantial attention due to its promising uses in several sectors, including medicines, agrochemicals, and material science. As a result, the synthesis of oxadiazine has a broad scope due to its uses in biological and chemical properties such as antibacterial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and insecticidal acts. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of oxadiazine's synthetic strategies and mechanistic aspects, prioritizing the various novel methods developed for synthesising oxadiazine. We demonstrated the synthesis of various oxadiazine derivatives such as&#160; 1,3,4&#8208;, 1,3,5&#8208;, 1,2,4&#8208;, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazines and the functionalization of this molecule to enhance their bioactivity. In this study, we discussed an overview of synthetic routes, such as cyclization reactions, cycloaddition reactions, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free reactions, triflate&#8208;catalyzed reactions, etc. We highlighted the challenges faced in the reported synthesis, suitable reaction conditions, substrate scope and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;C Glycoside Rearrangement through Time&#8208;Controlled Electrochemical Flow Strategy: Switching between Kinetics and Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report time&#8208;controlled O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement in flow&#8208;electrochemical microreactors, focusing on kinetic and thermodynamic selectivity. The selective synthesis of phenolic O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides has been explored using O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement. We investigated the time&#8208;control of O&#8208;C glycoside rearrangement using a flow microreactor, which allows for second&#8208;scale reaction control. The electrochemical approach demonstrated that shortening the residence time leads to the selective synthesis of O&#8208;glycosides, while longer times favor the formation of C&#8208;glycosides. Kinetic studies revealed that substituents on the phenol ring affect the rate of O&#8208;glycoside formation and its rearrangement to C&#8208;glycosides. Finally, continuous flow synthesis was demonstrated, showcasing the scalability and utility of this method for producing bioactive substances.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Driven Organophosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Iododifluoroalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalyzed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed, eliminating the need for additional metal catalysts and bases. This protocol enables the efficient and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides under mild conditions, demonstrating excellent tolerance to iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytic phosphine functions not only as a Lewis base, forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex with difluoroalkyl iodides through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions to generate Rf radicals, but also as a halogen transfer shuttle catalyst to facilitate the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pillararene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry on the Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes showed significant impact on the asymmetric synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acids, not only altering the reactivity of the substrates but also changing the enantiomeric excess of the products. This impact was influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the type of catalyst, the kind of pillararene, and especially, the structure of the aldehyde.







Abstract
To clarify the relationship between the host&#8208;guest complexation and enantioselectivity of an asymmetric reaction, we studied the impacts of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest chemistry on the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of cyclic dihydroquinazolinones from aldehydes, where the aldehydes meanwhile acted as guests. The addition of different pillar[5]arenes cannot only adjust the reactivity of the substrates but also change the enantiomeric excess of the products. The magnitude of such impacts is influenced by several factors, including the solvent, the temperature, the catalyst, the usage and kind of pillararenes, and the structure of aldehydes. When the pillararene&#8208;substrate interactions are strong in the reaction systems, the ee variations of products are mainly decided by the guests, aldehydes, whereas the reaction activities are mainly affected by the hosts, pillar[5]arenes.

         <title>Strategies for Modification of Tryptophan Residues: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives in Photo&#8208;/ Electrochemical&#8208;Induction, and Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in photo&#8208;induced, electro&#8208;induced and metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications of tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides, among others. The advantages of photoinduction and metal catalysis and their benefits in the development of tryptophan and its tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and their applicability in the development of novel biocompatible methods are discussed. In addition, the current limitations of these methods and the future challenges that need to be addressed are explored.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid distinguished by its unique indole ring, making it an ideal target for chemical modification. Recent advancements in modification strategies, including photo&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;induced, and metal&#8208;catalyzed techniques, have significantly enhanced the efficiency and selectivity of Trp modifications, expanding its applications across drug development, materials science, and environmental monitoring. Photochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which utilize light energy to drive reactions under mild conditions, offer a green and efficient method for Trp transformation. This approach often improves Trp's optical properties, such as fluorescence, thereby enhancing its utility in bioimaging and sensor applications. Light&#8208;driven modifications also allow the introduction of functional groups, yielding bioactive derivatives with potential therapeutic benefits. Electrochemical&#8208;induced modifications, which leverage electric energy to precisely regulate oxidation and reduction processes, enable selective Trp modifications through fine&#8208;tuning of applied potential. This method supports the targeted addition of functional groups like hydroxyl or amino groups, essential for synthesizing Trp derivatives aimed at modulating protein activity and developing new therapeutic agents. Both photo&#8208; and electrochemical methods generate radical intermediates via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET), aligning well with Trp's redox&#8208;active nature. These methods also offer mild and controllable conditions that address chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity challenges inherent in traditional bioconjugation strategies. The promising advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis underscore the appeal of novel Trp&#8208;based bioconjugation methods. In addition, metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations using transition metals such as palladium or copper allow for complex modifications, including C&#8722;H activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which enable site&#8208;selective alterations within the Trp molecule. These metal&#8208;catalyzed modifications yield derivatives with enhanced chemical, optical, or biological properties, suitable for applications in optoelectronics, biosensors, and medicinal chemistry. Collectively, these advancements in Trp modification elevate its utility across diverse scientific disciplines, providing a versatile platform for creating novel compounds with superior chemical, biological, and optical characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the latest advancements in Trp modification, with an emphasis on their transformative impact across various fields.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Mixed Docosahexaenoic Acid Phosphatidylcholine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis method is proposed for the production of mixed DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) phosphatidylcholines, allowing access to both regioisomers with DHA positioned at either the sn1 or sn2 site. Regioisomers of acetate derivatives (AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC, stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA) and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs (antioxidant drugs) were synthesized to investigate how the positional distribution of DHA within PCs influences brain and retinal uptake.







Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22&#8201;:&#8201;6 n&#8208;3) is a critical omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with essential roles in brain and retinal functions. Its selective uptake into these tissues is mediated by several pathways, including the transporter Mfsd2a, which preferentially utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine&#8208;DHA (LPC&#8208;DHA) as a substrate. Due to the low de novo synthesis of DHA, optimizing its dietary intake and exploring novel delivery strategies are important in pathologies that affect PUFA proportion. The present work focuses on developing an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic methodology to access structured mixed DHA phosphatidylcholines (mixed DHA&#8208;PCs), valuable biological tools for enhancing drug and/or DHA delivery to the brain and retina. Chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods were established to synthesize mixed sn1&#8208; or sn2&#8208;DHA&#8208;PC isomers, to study the importance of DHA position, from cost&#8208;effective glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC). The approach aligns with green chemistry principles by leveraging lipase&#8208;catalyzed regioselective acylation and deacylation reactions, thus reducing the number of chemical steps compared to traditional methods. The resulting mixed PCs AceDoPC&#174;, DoAcePC (stabilized forms of LPC&#8208;DHA), and phenolic&#8208;DHA&#8208;PCs were produced at a scale suitable for future in&#8197;vivo studies, enabling investigations into the positional effect of DHA on brain and retinal uptake.

         <title>Mechanochemical Dissociation of Singlet Carbene&#8211;CS2 Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical release of carbon disulfide (CS2) from singlet carbene&#8211;CS&#8322; adducts is explored. While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC) adducts exhibit complete conversion, cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) adduct undergoes decomposition. DFT calculations reveal how electronic structure influences CS2 release, offering insights into the reactivity of singlet carbenes&#8211;small molecule adducts.







Abstract
Owing to the extensive application of singlet carbenes, their generation through the release of small molecules from stable adducts is attracting increasing research interest. This study explores the mechanochemical release of CS2 from Carbene&#8211;CS2 adducts formed by three distinct singlet carbenes: cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC); N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC); and N,N&#8217;&#8208;diamidocarbene (DAC). Under ball&#8208;milling conditions, these adducts exhibit notably different reactivities; DAC&#8211;CS2 releases CS2 completely within 20&#8197;min, NHC&#8211;CS2 has a slower release rate, while CAAC&#8211;CS2 decomposes into a complex mixture. DFT calculations reveal that the release of CS2 from CAAC&#8211;CS2 requires the highest activation energy (32&#8197;kcal/mol), suggesting that it is inaccessible under the reaction conditions. This is likely because of the higher HOMO energy of CAAC, which correlates with a stronger bond with CS2, thereby limiting its dissociation. This study highlights how the electronic structures of carbenes influence their interactions with small molecules, paving the way for controlling the reactivity of carbene&#8211;small&#8208;molecule adducts.

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the extensive application of singlet carbenes, their generation through the release of small molecules from stable adducts is attracting increasing research interest. This study explores the mechanochemical release of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from &lt;b&gt;Carbene&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; adducts formed by three distinct singlet carbenes: cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (&lt;b&gt;CAAC&lt;/b&gt;); N-heterocyclic carbene (&lt;b&gt;NHC&lt;/b&gt;); and N,N&#8217;-diamidocarbene (&lt;b&gt;DAC&lt;/b&gt;). Under ball-milling conditions, these adducts exhibit notably different reactivities; &lt;b&gt;DAC&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; releases CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; completely within 20&#8197;min, &lt;b&gt;NHC&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; has a slower release rate, while &lt;b&gt;CAAC&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; decomposes into a complex mixture. DFT calculations reveal that the release of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from &lt;b&gt;CAAC&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; requires the highest activation energy (32&#8197;kcal/mol), suggesting that it is inaccessible under the reaction conditions. This is likely because of the higher HOMO energy of &lt;b&gt;CAAC&lt;/b&gt;, which correlates with a stronger bond with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby limiting its dissociation. This study highlights how the electronic structures of carbenes influence their interactions with small molecules, paving the way for controlling the reactivity of carbene&#8211;small-molecule adducts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A variety of isooxazoline&#8208;fused furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines containing four stereocenters were prepared in 40%&#8208;87% yields with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The control experimental results revealed that the reaction underwent in the order of [4+2] cycloaddition and sequential [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (ao&#8208;QM) generated from 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines, furan, and nitrile N&#8208;oxides generated from hydroxamoyl chlorides.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Thienylation/Oxylation Cascade of IIII/SVI&#8208;Ylides via Photoinduced EDA Complex Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols to afford &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyl ketone derivatives. The key of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes and the generation of unprecedented sulfoxonium ylide radical upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component cascade of &#945;&#8208;thienylation/oxylation of IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides, substituted thiophenes and alcohols is reported. The core of the strategy involves electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation between IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides and electron&#8208;rich thiophenes. Upon photo&#8208;activation, IIII/SVI&#8208;ylides in&#8208;situ generates sulfoxonium ylide radical, which is trapped by thiophenes to generate &#945;&#8208;thienyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;ketyl sulfoxonium ylides and initiated subsequent carbenic O&#8722;H insertion from alcohol component. All reactions are operationally simple and proceed smoothly under mild reaction conditions, affording a broad range of unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in moderate to good yields.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Directly&#8208;Linked Perylene Dimer from a 2,5,8,11&#8208;Tetraborylated Perylene</title>

While synthesizing a tetra&#8208;substituted perylene, we also made a hexa&#8208;substituted perylene dimer for the first time. It'll be a new way to create dimers bonding less reactive positions, making good use of the side reaction of cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
One&#8208;step Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 2,5,8,11&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated perylene with 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)bromo&#8208;benzene gave 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked perylene dimer for the first time in 7.3&#8201;% yield under the standard conditions. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure exhibits three independent dimers in the unit cell, reflecting the low rotational energy around 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linkage. Excited state properties of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimer were compared with the corresponding 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked congener. The facile synthetic method developed in this study could be a general route to access polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oligomers linked at less reactive positions.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization for Efficient Synthesis of Quinazolinones from Indoles and Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid/DMSO, and aliphatic amines to obtain valuable quinazolinone derivatives has been described. This strategy demonstrates mild reaction conditions, high efficiency, and excellent tolerance of functional groups. The applicability of the synthetic reaction was validated by synthesis of rutaecarpine and large&#8208;scale efficient synthesis of quinazolinones.







Abstract
In this study, we report an iodine&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction of indoles, glyoxylic acid or DMSO, and aliphatic amines to synthesize quinazolinone derivatives via oxygenation cleavage of the C=C double bonds of indoles. This method features mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent functional group tolerance. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated through its application in synthesizing rutaecarpine and a scalable protocol for efficient quinazolinone production.

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step procedure utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water was disclosed. Conceptually, this novel approach involves an initial Pd(0)/TPPMS&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of the benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines.







Abstract
We report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction/aromatization cascade utilizing readily available benzylic alcohols for the construction of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in water. Conceptually, this novel one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step approach involves an initial Pd(0)/sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene&#8208;3&#8208;sulfonate (TPPMS)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols, followed by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization of the in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes with tryptamines, and concludes with a DBU/air&#8208;promoted aromatization, allowing rapid access to the desired &#946;&#8208;carbolines. The &#960;&#8208;benzylPd&#8197;(II) catalytic system generated in&#8197;situ from Pd(0)/TPPMS and benzylic alcohols was found to be highly effective for alcohol dehydrogenation in water.

         <title>Investigations into Intramolecular Cerium&#8208; and Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Styryl Moieties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese catalysis affords oxidative radical cyclizations of &#947;&#8208;allyl &#946;&#8208;oxoesters in an atmosphere of air. The mediately formed peroxides are either reduced with zinc&#8211;acetic acid to yield tricylic lactones as final products. Alternatively, the peroxides are treated with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine to furnish bicyclic scaffolds with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl substructure in a subsequent Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation.







Abstract
Bicyclic diketones and lactones are obtained in up to 60&#8201;% yield in the aerobic, manganese&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular radical cyclization of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a six&#8208;membered ring and phenyl or diphenyl allyl substituents in the &#947;&#8208;position. Intermediate products of this transformation are peroxides, which are processed either reductively with zinc&#8211;acetic acid or by Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare fragmentation (with acetyl chloride&#8211;pyridine). The respective congeners with five&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings either undergo only &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation reactions or mixtures of various cyclization products are obtained in low yields. In this study, also cerium&#8208;catalysis was investigated, however, the yields are lower compared to manganese catalysis. The relative configurations of all racemic products were established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analyses.

The enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the asymmetric construction of acyclic 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon has been established, which involves an enantioselective addition reaction and a subsequent chelate&#8208;controlled diastereoselective alkylation reaction. Specifically, the enantioselective addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;thioacetamides with &#945;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted vinyl sulfones under chiral Br&#248;nsted base catalysis and the subsequent LDA&#8208;mediated diastereoselective methylation, allylation and benzylation at the &#945; position of the sulfonyl group of the adducts afforded the desired enantio&#8208;enriched products having 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers containing a tetrasubstituted carbon in a highly stereoselective manner.

Abstract
The surfactant&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones with indoles was investigated in an aqueous medium for the synthesis of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles. The reaction was carried out in the presence of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, which was initiated by two consecutive nucleophilic additions of indoles to the aldehyde group of ortho&#8208;formylarylketones, followed by a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and dehydrative aromatization.

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;Guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From radical initiation to dimer formation, the radical coupling reaction profile of Juncus acutus phenanthrenoids is mapped through a two&#8208;state mechanism, involving a triplet intermediate. This study offers crucial insights into the dimerization process, using computational methods to uncover molecular mechanisms and highlight the role of water in facilitating keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, advancing our understanding of biosynthesis in plants.







Abstract
Juncus acutus is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and in solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway.

     alt="Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT-Guided Exploration of Radical-Coupling Reaction Mechanisms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From radical initiation to dimer formation, the radical coupling reaction profile of &lt;i&gt;Juncus acutus&lt;/i&gt; phenanthrenoids is mapped through a two-state mechanism, involving a triplet intermediate. This study offers crucial insights into the dimerization process, using computational methods to uncover molecular mechanisms and highlight the role of water in facilitating keto-enol tautomerization, advancing our understanding of biosynthesis in plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Juncus acutus&lt;/i&gt; is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas-phase and in solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two-state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water-mediated keto-enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Synthesis of [1,3]Azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)lines and 2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides</title>

Syntheses of quinoline and quinoxaline derivatives fused with phosphacycles were developed from commercially available quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine.







Abstract
Despite their potential in areas such as medicinal chemistry and organic materials, scaffolds in which quinoline and quinoxaline are fused to phosphacycles such as 1,3&#8208;oxaphosphole, 1,3&#8208;azaphosphole, P&#8208;arylated and P&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;azaphosphole P&#8208;oxides have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this study we have developed a synthetic approach to [1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines from quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and quinoxalin&#8208;6&#8208;amine. These were converted to 5&#8208;phosphanylquino(xa)lin&#8208;6&#8208;amines by regioselective iodination in position 5, cross&#8208;coupling with diethyl phosphite and reduction. Formation of the azaphosphole ring was then achieved by reaction with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. Attempts at C&#8722;H arylation in position 2 did not lead to the desired derivatives but rather to 1&#8208;arylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quino(xa)line 1&#8208;oxides. Access to 1&#8208;alkoxylated 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3]azaphospholo[4,5&#8208;f]quinoline 1&#8208;oxides was also developed using as key steps cross&#8208;coupling with ethyl phosphinate formed in&#8197;situ and the subsequent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction. The resulting tricyclic compounds were finally tested against a panel of disease&#8208;related protein kinases.

Photoreactions have been widely used in multicomponent. This review highlights recent advances in multicomponent photochemical reactions using aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate as a starting material for synthesizing a variety of useful organic compounds.







Abstract
Photochemical multicomponent reactions are a valuable technology in modern synthetic chemistry. These reactions utilize visible light as a clean and renewable energy source, enabling the construction of diverse molecules from multiple substrates in a single step. These advantages have driven the application of multicomponent photochemical reactions in various fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and agrochemical development. Recently, aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborates have emerged as promising substrates for photochemical multicomponent reactions, and they have been used to synthesize a variety of complex compounds through photochemical multicomponent reactions.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene towards Dichalcogenide Bonds, IPr Carbene, 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylphenyl Isocyanide and Trimethylsilyl Azide</title>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene 1 towards small molecules was investigated, yielding a handful of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives.







Abstract
The development of phosphinidene precursors capable of releasing free phosphinidenes holds great potential in exploiting their reactivity with small molecules and enthalpically strong bonds. We report the facile cleavage of dichalcogenide bonds, including S&#8722;S, Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonded complexes over the phosphorus center of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (1), which produces a variety of phosphonodichalcogenides (2&#8208;4). We also show the ambiphilic nature of 1. The reaction of 1 with nucleophiles, such as 1,3&#8208;bis(isopropyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IiPr) and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl isocyanide (DipNC) gives a phosphinidene adduct of IiPr and a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;3&#8208;azaallene, respectively. Treatment of 1 with trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) affords an iminophosphanide, manifesting the nucleophilic nature of 1. These compounds were fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and spectroscopic analysis.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Alkyl enol Ether Synthesis via Microwave&#8208;Promoted, Base&#8208;Catalysed Alkyne Hydroalkoxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the synthesis of alkyl enol ethers was developed, based upon microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation, requiring only alkyne and alcohol components and mild base catalysis. The reaction displayed broad substrate tolerance and was highly selective for Z&#8208;configured, anti&#8208;Markovnikov enol ether products.







Abstract
The diverse reactivity presented by alkyl enol ethers underpins a wide range of synthetically significant processes. Their synthesis is often achieved by atom&#8208;economical alkyne hydroalkoxylation (i.&#8201;e., addition of an alcohol across an alkyne), either using superbasic conditions or transition metal catalysis. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions of the former approach limit substrate tolerance whilst the latter approach often requires inert, anhydrous conditions and exotic, expensive catalysts. In order to pursue more convenient, general and sustainable methodology for enol ether synthesis, we have developed microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation as an attractive solution. Our optimised conditions employ caesium carbonate as a mild base catalyst and the required alcohol as solvent and reagent, with reaction temperatures from 20&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C and reaction times from 10&#8211;60 minutes. We have demonstrated that the reaction shows broad tolerance of diverse substrate functionality (e.&#8201;g., ester, ether, carboxylate, nitrile, nitro, halide), including examples of terminal, internal, aryl and alkyl alkynes. Greatest reactivity is observed with electron&#8208;poor alkyne substrates, and the reaction shows near&#8208;complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity and a very strong stereochemical bias towards Z&#8208;configured enol ether products. These observations are consistent with a polar mechanism proceeding via a vinyl anion intermediate, and we provide empirical and computation evidence in support of this.

         <dc:description>A method for synthesizing indolo&#8208;fused 3&#8208;sulfenylpyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines has been developed through a one&#8208;pot, iodine&#8208;mediated domino reaction using indole&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, 3&#8208;aminopyrazoles and dichalcogenides or thiophenols. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway during the C&#8208;S bond formation, with an iodonium ion intermediate driving the cyclization step.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products, with their potent bioactivities and selectivities, significantly benefit human health and agriculture. The evolution of biosynthetic enzymes of natural products has greatly expanded their chemical space relevant to bioactivity. Insights from natural evolution provide valuable guidance for engineering these enzymes to create molecules with novel structures and bioactivities. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquterpene scaffold, indicating evolutionary relationships among sesquiterpene scaffolds such as humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, rooted in their biosynthetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in the discovery and characterization of these sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. These findings illuminate the logic behind the chemical and biosynthetic evolution of sesquiterpenes and offer opportunities to discover new sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Investigation on the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;Silylboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically examined. The overall reaction profile was proposed, and the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization was found to take place through an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity was determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect.







Abstract
The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

The arabino&#8208;configured lactone was accessed via the diastereoselective bromination of Cyrene, through an enamine&#8208;bromination/hydrolysis strategy, giving the thermodynamically stable equatorial bromide after a base catalyzed equilibration. A Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation and then reaction with benzoate followed by hydrolysis gave the target lactone. 3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribono&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone was accessible via the reaction of the bromide with benzoate prior to Baeyer&#8208;Villiger reaction resulting in the retention of configuration. The diastereoselectivity for the reactions and the formation of byproducts was rationalized by the involvement of an intermediate oxirane and subsequent House&#8208;Meinwald rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quinidine&#8208;Based Squaramide&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Double Hetero&#8208;Michael Addition&#8208;Cyclization of N&#8208;Benzylhydroxylamine: Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazines</title>

         <dc:description>
The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA) using hydroxylamine with dual reactive centers (O and N) enables efficient N&#8722;O heterocycle synthesis in one step. This study demonstrates a quinidine&#8208;derived squaramide&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade cyclization of N&#8208;benzyl hydroxylamine with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, yielding 1,2&#8208;benzoxazines with up to 99&#8201;% ee, moderate diastereoselectivity, and scalability without enantioselectivity loss.







Abstract
The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA), leveraging the reactivity of two distinct nucleophilic centers (oxygen and nitrogen), has emerged as a transformative strategy in organic synthesis for constructing carbon&#8208;hetero nuclear bonds in a single step. In this work, we report an innovative intermolecular DHMA cascade cyclization reaction catalyzed by a quinidine&#8208;based squaramide catalyst. The use of the squaramide catalyst is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances the electrophilicity of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, thereby promoting excellent enantioselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine. The process demonstrates excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99&#8201;% ee), moderate diastereoselectivity (up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and high yields. The four different 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine stereoisomers have been synthesized with excellent enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, the scaleup reaction of the methodology has been extended with excellent outcomes.

         <dc:description>
A refresh of the well&#8208;known myo&#8208;inositol chemistry is reported with a special focus on 2&#8208;O&#8208;alkylated compounds, chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose, 1,2&#8208;diketone and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;diketone derivatives optimizing the synthetic protocol also in gram scale. Orthogonally protected chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose was transformed into cyanohydrins to access to poly&#8208;hydroxylated&#8208;(aminomethyl)cyclohexane compounds.







Abstract
A refresh and improvement of the well&#8208;known myo&#8208;inositol chemistry is reported here, setting up a new synthetic protocol to obtain orthogonally protected compounds, with a special focus on the preparation of 2&#8208;O&#8208;alkylated compounds. A gram scale synthesis of the 2&#8208;allyl compound was performed and optimized in terms of yield. This intermediate is the precursor of chiro&#8208;1&#8208;inosose, for which synthetic procedures are lacking. Taking advantage of the easily handled allyl group, we were able to transform this keto compound into both the 1,2&#8208;diketone and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;diketone, intermediates of biological transformations used in several patented applications. Finally, to access poly&#8208;hydroxylated&#8208;(aminomethyl)cyclohexane compounds, the reaction of the keto compound with cyanide was optimized, affording cyanohydrins obtained as single stereoisomer, the precursor of the above compound.

         <dc:description>Up to now, there were only few reports on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed reduction of thioamides, one of the explanation of this scarcity being the possible metallic catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of species containing sulfur.

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Mediated by Supramolecular Containers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of supramolecular container mediated multicomponent reactions have been reviewed. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+). The multicomponent reactions cover Hantzsch, Biginelli, aza&#8208;Darzens, Strecker, and other three&#8208;component reactions. Effects of the supramolecular container has been illustrated and prospects for the future are also provided.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have drawn great attention due to their various significant advantages including highly efficient, environment&#8208;friendly, and atom&#8208;economic. Developing more efficient and selective MCRs is of great significance to construct chemical libraries of potential functional compounds. On the other hand, supramolecular containers have been successfully applied as novel nanoreactors to mediate diverse organic transformations, and MCRs are included. In this review, examples of supramolecular container mediated MCRs have been summarized. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+). The MCRs cover Hantzsch, Biginelli, aza&#8208;Darzens, Strecker, and other three&#8208;component reactions.

The supramolecular containers include &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;-CD), &#947;-cyclodextrin (&#947;-CD), calix[4]arene, self-assembled Ga(III)-ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), and decanuclear 3d&#8211;4f lanthanide metal-organic cage ([Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Yb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). The MCRs cover Hantzsch, Biginelli, aza-Darzens, Strecker, and other three-component reactions. Effects of the supramolecular containers have been illustrated and prospects for the future are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO demonstrated the effectiveness of structurally rigid planar COPV platform for full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism. Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 achieved a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) &#8805;0.90 in aprotic solvents, with a 0.74&#8197;eV shift between cyclohexane and methanol. [Ph&#8322;N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]&#8322;CO demonstrated lower PLQY but enhanced sensitivity to water content and extinction coefficient of up to 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism was demonstrated using two carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO with a push&#8211;pull system, where the donor and acceptor moieties are diphenylamino and a carbonyl group, respectively. In non&#8208;polar cyclohexane, the molecules exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#955;PL=443 and 464&#8197;nm) with a locally excited character, while in polar solvents, a charge&#8208;transfer character emerged. In methanol, red emission was observed (&#955;PL=602 and 572&#8197;nm). The difference in luminescence maxima between cyclohexane and methanol corresponds to 0.74 and 0.59&#8197;eV for Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO, respectively, which are larger than those of previously reported push&#8211;pull systems. The photoluminescence quantum yields of Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 in aprotic solvents were 0.90 and higher regardless of solvent polarity, while they decreased in protic solvents. The molecules also display high extinction coefficients of up to 2.8x104 and 6.4x104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of structurally rigid planar COPV framework. Furthermore, [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO showed significant responses to water content in tetrahydrofuran&#8208;water mixed solvents, which highlights its potential for sensing applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Direct Synthesis of Secondary Amides and Nitriles Using O&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc Hydroxylamine</title>

         <dc:description>
We explored the first application of the novel O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine reagent for the direct synthesis of secondary amides and nitriles from ketones and aldehydes via the Beckmann rearrangement. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that this reagent is more stable than similar alternatives. This protocol offers notable advantages: it is operationally simple, mild, metal&#8208;free, conducted in open air, scalable, operates at ambient temperature, high yields, and demonstrates good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating agent, O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine (PymONHBoc), has been designed and synthesized, from readily available 2&#8208;chloropyrimidine. This reagent demonstrates superior shelf stability and ease of handling compared to other hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents. Here, we present a metal&#8208;free method for the direct conversion of ketones and aldehydes into sec&#8208;amides and nitriles using PymONHBoc as the aminating agent. This method efficiently converts a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds into the corresponding amides and nitriles with good to excellent yields under ambient conditions. The use of PymONHBoc is advantageous, as it facilitates the in&#8197;situ generation of the activated oxime intermediate, concomitantly producing a non&#8208;interfering byproduct.

Enzymatic Resolution An expedient approach to the multigram preparation of enantioenriched 2&#8208;((hetera)cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on their enzymatic acylation or enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates is described. Utility of the obtained intermediates for the preparation of chiral sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks valuable to drug discovery is demonstrated.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 2&#8208;((hetera) cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on enzymatic resolution is described. It is shown that enzymatic acylation could be used for the preparation of enantioenriched title compounds with primary alkyl substituents at the C&#8208;2 position. Meanwhile, enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates was optimal for the preparation of the target alcohols when significant steric hindrance is present, e.&#8201;g., due to the &#945;&#8208;branching. The latter factor was demonstrated to be crucial for the enzymatic reaction rate in both cases. The synthetic utility of the obtained chiral alcohols was demonstrated through Mitsunobu configuration inversion, as well as by preparation of the corresponding primary amines &#8211; valuable sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for medicinal chemistry.

This study introduces an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination of homopropargyl N&#8208;tosyl amides to synthesize substituted &#947;&#8208;lactams via alkynyl phenyl selenide intermediates. Optimization of the flow&#8208;based cyclization improved efficiency, saving time and resources. Additionally, DFT calculations detailed the reaction mechanism for a model alkynyl phenyl selenide.







Abstract
In this work, we present an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed intramolecular hydroamination reaction of homopropargyl N&#8208;tosyl amides to produce synthetically useful substituted &#947;&#8208;lactams through the corresponding alkynyl phenyl selenide intermediates. Our focus on optimising the cyclisation protocol under flow conditions has led to a significant enhancement in efficiency, thereby reducing the time and resources required for the process. DFT calculations of the reaction mechanism for the catalytic transformation of a model alkynyl phenyl selenide were also conducted.

         <title>Reactions of Unsymmetric Chiral Dialdehydes with Lysine: Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Macrocyclization and Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes are discovered to undergo regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions with an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine, to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. Addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. These compounds are also found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.







Abstract
Three BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (S)&#8208;4, (S)&#8208;5, and (S)&#8208;6, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (S)&#8208;4 and (S)&#8208;5 are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.

Abstract
A novel Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of N&#8208;hydroxyoximes with maleate esters/2&#8208;chloroacrylates is disclosed, in which diverse isoquinoline skeleton compounds were generated in moderate to excellent yields. The protocol exhibits a good compatibility of functional groups and wide scope of substrates without using any external metal oxidants. Gram&#8208;scale and derivatization reactions were performed to show the potential utility of this transformation.

         <title>Diethylaluminium Chloride&#8208;Mediated Cycloaddition/Conjugate Reduction Sequence towards Imido&#8208;Substituted Norbornenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethylaluminiumchloride was shown to be an effective reagent for the stereoselective hydrogenation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted norbornadienes. Mechanistic insights were provided by the investigation of the kinetics, NMR studies as well as deuteration experiments.







Abstract
Diethylaluminium chloride is a known Lewis acid and can undergo 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;additions, whereas conjugate reductions are mostly observed as side reactions. By serendipity we found a Et2AlCl&#8208;promoted sequential cycloaddition/conjugate hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene and 4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylpropioloyl) oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one resulting in the clean formation of the corresponding norbornene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one. NMR, kinetic and deuteration experiments provided insight into the mechanism of this reaction sequence.

         <title>Guaiacylglycerol as an Intermediate in Vanillin Production during Oxidative Conversion of Guaiacyl Lignin under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanillin production via oxidative degradation of softwood lignin in aqueous alkali is a promising method for producing bio&#8208;based aromatic compounds. This study identifies guaiacylglycerol, an unstable intermediate previously overlooked, as a key compound formed through ether cleavage, emphasizing its significance in the vanillin production pathway.







Abstract
Depolymerizing lignin into hydroxybenzaldehydes like vanillin via oxidative degradation is a promising approach for lignin valorization. Alkaline nitrobenzene (AN) oxidation is a highly selective method for oxidative lignin conversion and serves as a benchmark in lignin chemistry, yet its reaction mechanisms are not fully understood. Previously, we proposed a pathway converting a phenolic &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound, erythro&#8208;guaiacylglycerol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;guaiacyl ether (GG), into vanillin through enol ether intermediates, E/Z&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyphenoxy)&#8208;ethenyl]&#8208;phenol EE. This study extends that work by exploring alternative AN oxidation pathways of GG that bypass EE. Through experiments assessing the impact of OH&#8722; concentration and studying deuterium incorporation at the &#945;&#8208;position of vanillin produced from both GG and isolated EE in NaOD/D&#8322;O, we identified guaiacylglycerol (GGL) as a new intermediate in a distinct pathway. GGL forms via &#946;&#8208;ether cleavage of a dianion arising from dual deprotonation of GG&#8242;s phenolic and &#945;&#8208;OH groups, a process favored under high OH&#8722; concentrations conducive to dianion formation. Subsequent oxidation of GGL yields vanillin, with significant exchange of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen with solvent molecules. This study elucidates the complex mechanisms of AN oxidation and introduces novel intermediates and pathways, enhancing strategies for efficient lignin conversion into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoxazoles by Metal&#8208;Free Oxidative Cyclization of Catechols with Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple strategy for constructing benzoxazoles via the direct oxidative cyclization of easily accessible catechols and primary amines is achieved using two complement oxidative systems. The DDQ/EA system provides a powerful route for 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzoxazoles synthesis, while the O2/water system proved to be more effective for constructing 2&#8208;alkyl benzoxazoles, thereby making it indisputably the simplest method for benzoxazole synthesis.







Abstract
Benzoxazoles are crucial in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Their simple, economical, green, and efficient synthesis has attracted long&#8208;standing interest in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an extremely simple strategy for constructing benzoxazoles via the direct oxidative cyclization of readily available catechols and primary amines, using DDQ/EA and O&#8322;/water oxidative systems, respectively. The DDQ/EA system demonstrates distinct advantages in substrate and functional group compatibility. In contrast, the O&#8322;/water system, which is milder, greener, and more economical, excels in synthesizing C&#8208;2 alkyl&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles. Overall, these two systems provide complementary advantages and are both well&#8208;suited for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Given its high simplicity and practicality, this strategy could serve as a promising alternative in benzoxazole synthesis.

A novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons has been developed, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1] or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] manner.Two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields and with excellent selectivity in this tandem annulations, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines.







Abstract
Aldehydes as one of the most widely building blocks, have been frequently utilized as privileged C1 electrophile units and exhibited versatile applications to construct carbon&#8208;heteroatom and carbon&#8208;carbon bond. We herein described a novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1]or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1]manner. The maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons (n = 3, 6, 7) were originally designed and developed by our group which were used as flexible bisnucleophiles. By this tandem annulations approach, two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields (74&#8211;91&#8201;%) and with excellent selectivity, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines (24 examples) and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines (22 examples). Significantly, formaldehyde, long&#8208;chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes can act as C1 electrophile units catalyzed by racemic BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoric acid catalyst in these transformations, which then selectively attacked the OH or NH group bearing in functionalized maleimides and underwent the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond in a short time under microwave irradiation conditions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Sustainable Total Synthesis and Chiral Pool Strategies with Emphasis on (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol in Natural Products Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are continuous efforts to improve total syntheses of natural products, particularly their sustainability, such as developing effective chiral pool approaches relying on a wide spectrum of natural chirons, including (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol as one of the most useful natural chirons. Here, we analyze recent developments in sustainable total synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge chiral pool strategies while focusing on the synthesis of a broad range of complex and bioactive molecules from (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol though various key intermediates.







Abstract
Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the application of chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the preparation of natural products through diverse routes employing (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt. Innovative catalytic and synthetic protocols using (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol are also analyzed and discussed.

         <title>Quinoid Carbene Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in bioactive molecules, drugs, and materials. Diazo quinones, with unique reactivity, offer a promising route for forming these bonds. This review outlines recent progress using quinoid carbenes from diazo quinones to build C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds via various catalytic transformations, providing milder alternatives for diverse compound synthesis.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Traditional methods for synthesizing these bonds often rely on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Ullmann reactions, which have limitations, including the requirement for elevated temperature and basic conditions. In recent years, diazo quinones have emerged as promising reagents for C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bond formation due to their unique structural and reactive properties, which include high electrophilicity and a tendency toward aromatization. This review highlights recent advances in the use of quinoid carbenes, derived from diazo quinones, for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds. Key methodologies discussed include rhodium&#8208;, iridium&#8208;, ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, heteroatom&#8208;H bond insertion reactions, migration reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. These methods offer mild, functional group&#8208;tolerant alternatives to traditional approaches, showcasing their utility in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules, medicinally relevant compounds, and materials.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Azidative Functionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes is a powerful way to produce valuable chiral alkyl azides. This review summarizes the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes over the past quarter of a century. Four reaction models, including conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer, are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Aliphatic azides are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds found in numerous biologically active molecules. Besides, they also serve as useful building blocks owning to their remarkable reactivities. Catalytic azidation of alkenes is an efficient way to produce aliphatic azides. In this respect, azidated chiral molecules can be formed if a chiral catalyst is used. The last quarter of century has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes to yield chiral alkyl azides. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes systematically, from the view of reaction models (conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer) combining the roles that azido sources play (nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical).

     alt="Catalytic Asymmetric Azidative Functionalization of Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes is a powerful way to produce valuable chiral alkyl azides. This review summarizes the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes over the past quarter of a century. Four reaction models, including conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer, are discussed in detail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliphatic azides are an important class of nitrogen-containing compounds found in numerous biologically active molecules. Besides, they also serve as useful building blocks owning to their remarkable reactivities. Catalytic azidation of alkenes is an efficient way to produce aliphatic azides. In this respect, azidated chiral molecules can be formed if a chiral catalyst is used. The last quarter of century has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes to yield chiral alkyl azides. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes systematically, from the view of reaction models (conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer) combining the roles that azido sources play (nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical). This review will be useful to the fields of azide chemistry and asymmetric alkene functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Urea as an Amine Source to Synthesize Primary Aromatic Amines via Nickel&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an efficient and regiospecific approach for the direct synthesis of primary aromatic amines through nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H amination, utilizing urea &#8211; an abundant, non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical &#8211; as a sustainable amine source. This method eliminates the need for conventional protection and deprotection steps, offering a streamlined solution for the amination of arenes.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient method has been developed for the transformation of aromatic CAr&#8722;H bond into CAr&#8722;NH&#8322; via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation, eliminating the need for additional protection and deprotection steps. This strategy employs 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a directing group and urea as the nitrogen source, a non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical. The reaction exhibits high selectivity, exclusively yielding mono&#8208;aminated primary aromatic amines. Furthermore, the protocol is tolerant of a wide range of substrates with various functional groups, producing the corresponding ortho&#8208;aminobenzamides in yields ranging from 38&#8201;% to 73&#8201;%. The preliminary results indicate the C&#8722;H bond cleavage is likely the rate&#8208;determining step in the reaction.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Multicomponent Reactions of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in multicomponent reactions of indoles from 2014 to 2024, focusing on site&#8208;selective synthesis strategies, catalytic systems, reaction mechanisms and their applications in constructing various indole derivatives, and also discusses the future development trends in this field.







Abstract
Indoles, which are distinguished by their nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic structure, play a pivotal role in organic chemistry due to their diverse biological profiles and unique chemical reactivity. In particular, poly&#8208;substituted indoles are extensively found in a wide range of natural products, pharmaceuticals, materials, and bioactive compounds. The integration of indoles into multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has emerged as a powerful synthetic strategy, facilitating the construction of these complex poly&#8208;substituted indole frameworks from simple precursors. This review highlights the latest advancements in MCRs involving indoles, focusing on innovative methodologies for site&#8208;selective synthesis of indole derivatives, catalytic systems, mechanistic insights, and their applications. The review encompasses significant developments from 2014 to 2024 and covers a variety of indole MCRs, including those targeting the C3 position, dual&#8208;site reactions at the C2 and C3 positions, and reactions involving the pyrrole and benzene rings of the indole scaffold.

In this article, the efficient formal hydroamidation of terminal and internal alkynes is described, which constitutes the Ni&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalumination of alkynes and subsequent treatment with isocyanates. This method is gram&#8208;scalable and the synthetic utility is highlighted by the synthesis of a &#946;&#8208;lactam from &#945;&#8208;phenyl acrylamide.

         <title>5&#8208;Substituted 1,2&#8208;Dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;Pyrrolizidines Related to Swainsonine: Synthesis and Inhibition Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile methodology for the synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;pyrrolizidines was developed based on a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination and a late&#8208;stage derivatisation of a common epoxide intermediate accessible in 8 steps from d&#8208;ribose. The synthesised heterocycles were tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi&#8208; and a lysosomal&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;mannosidase.







Abstract
Development of selective Golgi &#945;&#8208;mannosidase II inhibitors possessing a modified swainsonine skeleton has recently become a popular field of study due to their great potential in suppressing metastasis. However, most of the studied modifications involve addition of a substituent on the bicycle which makes the synthesis rather complex as five stereogenic centres have to be generated. Inspired by our previously developed synthesis of (5S)&#8208;5&#8208;benzylswainsonines utilizing a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination, we decided to further investigate the versatility of this strategy by preparing a small collection of simplified analogues bearing only two hydroxy groups, thus eliminating one of the stereogenic centres. This contribution reports a concise synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;pyrrolizidines whose key features include small number of steps, high yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The title compounds were also tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi and a lysosomal &#945;&#8208;mannosidase to assess the effects of the substituents, ring size and missing C8&#8208;hydroxyl on potency and selectivity.

         <title>A Platinum(0) Complex as &#960;&#8208;Lewis Base Catalyst for Asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt0 complex functions as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to promote the asymmetric Friedel&#8722;Crafts reaction of unsaturated carbonyl&#8208;tethered heteroarenes upon dihapto&#8208;coordination, and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity is achieved.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate that a Pt0 complex can function as an efficient &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of deactivated heteroarenes upon &#951;2&#8208;coordination and resultant &#960;&#8208;backdonation, thus enabling asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with electrophiles. A diversity of densely functionalized adducts are produced in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Preliminary frontier molecular orbital (FMO) calculations and in&#8197;situ 1H NMR analysis support the Pt0 &#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalytic mode.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Linalool&#8208;Derived Compounds via Catalytic Epoxidation and Ring Opening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the selective epoxidation of linalool using a cobalt&#8208;based catalyst, achieving high yields of linalool epoxide under mild conditions. The methodology was extended to rosewood oil as a raw feedstock, and regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions led to the formation of novel ethers. These results demonstrate the potential of linalool&#8208;derived compounds for fine chemical applications.







Abstract
This study focuses on the selective epoxidation of linalool to produce linalool epoxide, and novel linalool&#8208;derived compounds from this epoxide. A robust and non&#8208;noble cobalt catalyst was employed to achieve high yields of linalool epoxide under mild reaction conditions. The catalytic system displayed remarkable efficiency and reusability, providing a platform for exploring different feedstock, including rosewood oil, to demonstrate its versatility in raw feedstock valorization. Further functionalization of linalool&#8208;derived molecules was achieved through regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions, yielding novel ethers with potential applications in the fine chemical industry. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive approach to the sustainable synthesis of linalool&#8208;derived compounds, displaying the versatility of the catalytic system and providing a basis for the development of fine organic compounds with potential industrial applications.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing 6&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes: Bicyclic Piperidine Analogs for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are proposed as advanced building blocks for early drug discovery programs. For this purpose, their straightforward multigram synthesis, physicochemical, and structural characterization were performed. Effects of fluorine&#8208;containing substituents and the bicyclic system on the compound's pKa, LogP, and conformational behavior in the crystalline state were demonstrated.







Abstract
Convenient synthetic approaches to a series of fluorinated bicyclic piperidine analogs (including 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;, 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes) were proposed. Using commercially available fluorination agents, the target building blocks were prepared in gram to decagram scale in a single run. Evaluation of pKa and LogP values revealed the importance of the fluorine&#8208;containing substituent and methylene bridge relative disposition for the compound's physicochemical properties. Analysis of molecular structure using the exit vector plot (EVP) approach revealed negligible change in molecules conformation upon fluorination.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Formation of a Decasubstituted Phenanthrene by Coupling and Fragmentation of a Smaller Precursor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When epoxynaphthalene 5 is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is the decasubstituted phenanthrene 6, formed by Ullmann coupling and a surprising fragmentation and rearrangement.







Abstract
When 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (5) is heated with copper powder and no solvent at 340&#8201;&#176;C under argon, the chief product is 1,8&#8208;dibenzoyl&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10&#8208;octaphenylphenanthrene (6) in yields as high as 68&#8201;%. The reaction appears to involve Ullmann coupling of 5 and expulsion of two molecules of diphenylacetylene to give a decaphenyl bis(isobenzofuran) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization and fragmentation to yield phenanthrene 6.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems Based on Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) cores were employed to develop acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores. These compounds demonstrated extensive visible&#8208;light absorption and complex redox properties, including &#960;&#8208;dimer and mixed&#8208;valence formations. Computational studies revealed tunable electronic transitions, while preliminary solar cell tests led to promising efficiency, showcasing IDT&#8208;TTF's as a versatile donor unit for organic electronics.







Abstract
Here, we present a series of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8722;D&#8208;A) conjugated molecules incorporating an indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) as the central electron&#8208;donating moiety, functionalized with various lateral electron acceptors. A key synthetic step was the Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack formylation of the IDT&#8208;TTF, providing the dialdehyde in quantitative yield. This compound was further used for the incorporation of dicyanovinyl and indanedione acceptors. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy of the A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds in solution revealed a broad absorption in the visible spectrum which is further red&#8208;shifted when proceeding from solutions to thin films. Their cyclic voltammograms in solution showed a multi&#8208;redox behavior &#8211; undergoing both oxidation and reduction events. Notably, the oxidation of these compounds unveiled the formation of intermolecular mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species, especially strong in the case of the indanedione&#8208;containing derivative. Computational calculations helped us to identify the electronic transitions involved in the main absorption bands of these A&#8722;D&#8208;A compounds displaying different behaviors depending on the acceptor attached to the IDT&#8208;TTF core. Finally, the potential of these compounds as donors in organic solar cells was investigated and the best performing solar cell exhibited a modest yet promising power conversion efficiency of 0.87&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in the &#945;&#8208;Hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;Amination) of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, notable progress has been achieved in the &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds, especially in the direct asymmetric electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination with dialkyl azodicarboxylates. This review summarizes all the methods that appeared over the past decade, categorized based on the type of the reactive chiral intermediate (enamine, enol, enolate). Other reaction types are discussed at the end.







Abstract
The electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (generally referred to as &#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds with dialkyl azodicarboxylates is a powerful approach for the preparation of synthetically useful intermediates such as &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes and ketones, &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Many methods for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination have been published in the past and many new approaches have been disclosed in the last decade that deal with previously unresolved issues such as the direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination of &#945;&#8208;branched ketones. The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination is the field where most significant advances have been attained thanks to new approaches, catalysts and techniques. With this review we intend to cover the literature that appeared between 2015 and 2024. We will classify the various methods according to the strategies for the enantioselective formation of the new C&#8722;N bond, mainly based on the formation of chiral enamines, enols and enolates. Miscellaneous methods are grouped at the end of the review. Where relevant, the application of &#945;&#8208;hydrazino carbonyl compounds to the synthesis of target molecules will also be illustrated.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of Tetrahydropyrimidines and Dihydropyrrolidones through Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Amines, 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes, and Alkyne Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent reaction is developed for the synthesis of heterocycles under mild conditions. Amines, 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes, and alkyne esters are assembled for the construction of tetrahydropyrimidines and dihydropyrrolidones, the chemoselectivity of the reaction is controlled by the substitution of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes. During the transformation, aryl substituted triazinanes serve as three&#8208;atom synthons, and alkyl substituted triazinanes work as two&#8208;atom synthons.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of amines, 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes, and alkyne esters for the construction of tetrahydropyrimidines and dihydropyrrolidones derivatives was reported. Shifting the substituent group of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes led to the chemoselective synthesis. As three&#8208;atom synthons, aryl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were applied to the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydropyrimidines. Alkyl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes working as two&#8208;atom synthons promoted intramolecular cyclization to generate dihydropyrrolidones analogues. The practicality of the developed methods was demonstrated by easy operation, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and good functional groups tolerance.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Synthesis of Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the photochemical synthesis of esters, including cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with aryl or alkyl halides, phenols and aldehydes or alcohols, alcohols with &#945;&#8208;keto acids, alcohols or phenols with benzaldehydes or benzylic alcohols as well as aldehydes and benzyl or alkyl halides, emphasizing the development of novel protocols, limitations and strategies for expanding the utility.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for making a variety of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The development of esterification reactions induced by light is an atom economical and energy efficient alternative to traditional methods for the synthesis of esters, with benefits including mild reaction conditions, high chemical yields, and wide functional group tolerance. This review summarizes recent progress made in this green methodology, including mechanisms of action, substrate scope, limitations and future prospects.

         <title>Automated and Parallel Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a streamlined, automated method for synthesizing amide&#8208;containing compounds, crucial in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Utilizing pre&#8208;packed capsules and 96&#8208;well plate kits, this user&#8208;friendly approach simplifies the reaction and isolation processes, accommodating diverse reactants. This work allows to enhance medicinal chemistry by accelerating the creation of compound libraries with high efficiency and yield.







Abstract
Amide bonds are ubiquitous in molecules of interest such as pharmaceuticals, natural products, and agrochemicals. Over the last decades, significant efforts have been directed at developing efficient methods for the formation of this class of chemical bonds. Herein, we disclose a robust, user&#8208;friendly approach for the efficient and rapid parallel synthesis of amide&#8208;containing compounds, in good yield and purity. Our approach utilizes automated synthesis technologies and pre&#8208;packed capsules containing all the necessary materials for the reaction and work&#8208;up. Following manual addition of the amine and carboxylic acid, the reaction and product isolation is achieved automatically in a standardized, integrated manner. This methodology tolerates a wide diversity of carboxylic acids and amines (or amine salts). To accelerate discovery and rapidly create amide&#8208;containing compound libraries, the method was miniaturized into an automated parallel synthesis format, using 96&#8208;well plate kits, which could be beneficial to medicinal chemists.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. Therefore, Cu(I) salt catalysis this reaction in a unique way. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8208;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in a pure form and fully characterized using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Mediated Chemoselective Synthesis of Novel Spiro Benzoxazinoindoline and Extended Synthesis of Spiro Benzoxazinoindene Derivatives*</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a greener and novel synthesis of Water&#8208;mediated Spiro benzoxazinoindoline and Sprio benzoxazinoindene compounds, a class of spiro compounds highly valued for their properties and significant medicinal potential. We report over more than 30 novel examples synthesized using green and sustainable process, easy operational steps, achieving good to excellent yields.

Abstract
Spirobenzoxazines are a unique class of heterocyclic compounds that combine the structural features of spiro and benzooxazine frameworks, offering enhanced chemical stability and diverse biological activities. Their rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures make them ideal candidates for interacting with biological targets, contributing to their potential in various therapeutic applications, including anticancer, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibition. However, the development of efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazines remains a challenge in organic synthesis. In this work, we present a novel and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazine derivatives. Utilizing water as a green solvent, this methodology offers an efficient and sustainable route for constructing these complex heterocyclic frameworks. By emphasizing eco&#8208;friendly practices, this approach aligns with the principles of green chemistry, providing both high yields and operational simplicity. This advancement not only highlights the potential of spirobenzoxazines in the pharmaceutical and material sciences but also paves the way for future research in sustainable synthetic methodologies.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Analysis of Published Br&#248;nsted Plots Supports Br&#248;nsted's &#8220;Conventional&#8221; pKa Values: 14.00&#8201;for Water and 0.00&#8201;for H+(aq)</title>

A representative linear Br&#248;nsted plot for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Percentages given here are drawn from 34 plots of H2O values and 12 plots of H+ values.







Abstract
In the early 1900s, Br&#248;nsted used two different pairs of pKa values for water and the aqueous proton: He denoted 14.00 and 0.00 (respectively) as the &#8220;conventional&#8221; values, and 15.74 and &#8722;1.74 (respectively) as the &#8220;rational&#8221; values. Although the conventional values have been supported by both experiment and theory, the rational values have been employed in the vast majority of studies involving Br&#248;nsted plots up to the present day. Here we present a meta&#8208;analysis of 67 Br&#248;nsted plots published from 1924 to 2010, revealing that rational pKa&#8217; values more frequently appear as statistical outliers (a greater than 80&#8201;% rejection rate) compared to conventional values (a roughly 50&#8201;% rejection rate) based on Q&#8208;tests. Furthermore, in 85&#8201;% of examined plots, the conventional points align more closely with best&#8208;fit lines. An evaluation of Hupe and Pohl's Marcus plots also shows a somewhat better fit with the conventional rather than the rational pKa&#8217; values. Finally, in the bond length versus pKa investigations published by Brydon et&#8197;al., all the rational points were statistically rejected, whereas the conventional values were accepted. From our statistical analyses, we conclude that a convincing majority of experimental evidence from published Br&#248;nsted plots leads one to question the validity of Br&#248;nsted's rational pKa&#8217; values for water and the aqueous proton (15.74 and &#8722;1.74, respectively).

         <title>Effect of Substituents on the Tautomerism of Pyridone Nucleoside Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical work shows that the predominant tautomer of 6&#8208;fluoropyridones is the lactim, not the lactam form. This makes them analogs of cytosine, not uracil or thymine in the context of incorporation opposite complementary bases of genetic sequences.







Abstract
Nucleobase analogs are important tools in medicine and chemical biology, as they offer molecular targeting options for the intervention in genetic processes. Pyridone C&#8208;nucleosides have been shown to pair with adenine in complementary strands, but a switch from the lactam to lactim form may change their base pairing preference. We synthesized 6&#8208;fluoropyridone analogs of aciclovir and cidofovir, which we assumed to be in the lactam form, but were found to lack activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Spectroscopic data then indicated that they are predominantly in the lactim form, with a hydrogen bonding pattern suitable for G. The tautomerism of fluoropyridones was then studied by UV&#8208;spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The UV spectroscopic pattern for either tautomer was corroborated by synthesizing N&#8208; and O&#8208;methylated model compounds, and measuring their spectra. The tautomeric equilibrium of selected other substituted pyridones is predicted, based on density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Free Ketone Synthesis via Radical Coupling Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for the preparation of various ketones via radical coupling mechanisms using photoredox catalysis was described. The reaction was promoted by one&#8208;electron reduction of acyl imidazole without the involvement of NHC. The method exhibited broad tolerance to a variety of alkyl radical substrates, including alkyl boronic acids, boronic esters, alkyl trifluoroborates, carboxylic acids, and Hantzsch esters.







Abstract
Ketone synthesis via radical coupling mechanisms has recently gained significant attention. Traditionally, these methods have relied on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to generate the key ketyl radical intermediate, either through single&#8208;electron reduction of acyl azolium or single&#8208;electron oxidation involving the Breslow intermediate. In this report, we introduce a novel photoredox protocol that directly generates ketyl radicals from stable acyl imidazoles without the need for NHCs. This approach not only simplifies the process, but also demonstrates broad tolerance for various alkyl radical substrates. Additionally, it can be extended to facilitate relay&#8208;radical coupling reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Reactions of Alkynyl Sulfides: Versatile Tools in Synthetic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a review of recent advances on catalytic transformations of alkynyl sulfides since 2004. Four different types of reaction modes, including the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization, electrophilic addition, radical&#8208;initiated functionalization, and formal [2+n] cycloaddition, are presented, with an emphasis on analysis of reaction mechanisms and key facts for controlling the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Alkynyl sulfides, a significant class of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkynes, have garnered considerable attention within the synthetic community because of their distinctive characteristics, such as the enhanced reactivity, precise selectivity control, and facile derivatization via C&#8722;S bond couplings. Their transformations can provide a direct access to functionalized organosulfur and even sulfur&#8208;free compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, which is very attractive for many fields, including organic synthesis, material science, medicinal chemistry, and life science. This review summarizes the recent progresses on catalytic reactions of alkynyl sulfides, such as the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed controllable functionalizations, including hydro&#8208;, hetero&#8208;, and carbofunctionalizations, electrophilic additions, radical addition&#8208;initiated functionalizations, and formal [2+n] cycloadditions, in which the reaction mechanism, selectivity control, scope and limitations are discussed in detail. Given the rapidly increasing interests and applications of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in both chemistry and life science, it can be anticipated that this review will be valuable for synthetic chemists and may contribute further development of the alkynyl sulfide chemistry.

         <title>Cu&#8208;catalyzed Bilateral Linkage of Sulfenamides for the Construction of Benzothiophene&#8208;based Cyclic Sulfilimines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed bilateral linkage of sulfenamides and diaryliodonium salts was developed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of Benzothiophene&#8208;based cyclic sulfilimines. The challenging cyclic sulfoximines can be efficiently obtained via subsequent oxidation. Photophysical properties and DFT calculations reveal that cyclic sulfoximines, compared to cyclic sulfilimines and sulfones, exhibit larger Stokes shifts and reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO orbital overlap.

Robust route towards the implementation of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation employed cellulose&#8208;derived levoglucosenone ring contraction through a 2&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process. The development and optimization of a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot route towards substituted butyrolactones from levoglucosenone and cyrene derived from cellulose, representing a major step towards the sustainable production of chiral platform chemicals. A range of substituted analogues have been employed and their novelty is outlined in the paper.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot rapid microwave assisted method has been developed for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of biomass derived levoglucosenone (LGO) analogues. This method uses the acidic resin Amberlyst 15 as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in ethanol solution. A small library of C4&#8208;substituted LGO analogues have been synthesised and oxidised using this method giving high yields in short times in each case. The purity of the recovered products was very high removing the need for chromatographic separation.

         <title>Synthesis of Quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines and their Photophysical Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nine novel quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines were successfully synthesized. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed remarkable optoelectronic properties. Large Stokes shifts were especially observed for the protonated substrates. The experimental results were compared and complemented with quantum chemical calculations, providing further insights into the compounds&#8217; properties.







Abstract
Quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines were synthesized from para&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diamines, which were obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The diamines were converted into amides and ortho&#8208;cyclized to quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines using Morgan&#8208;Walls reactions. Prolonged reaction times were required in these electrophilic substitution reactions to overcome the respective deactivated intermediates formed after the first ortho fusion. Optophysical properties were determined by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and calculated by quantum chemical calculations. The compounds exhibit rather small HOMO/LUMO gaps and a remarkable bathochromic shift of luminescence upon protonation, what makes these compounds promising candidates for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Boronates from Aldehydes and Ketones by Peterson Olefination: Investigation of the Peterson/Boron&#8208;Wittig Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have investigated the possibility of synthesizing substituted vinyl boronates from gem&#8208;borylsilylmethane derivatives using the Peterson olefination. Our results show a total chemoselectivity for the Peterson olefination over the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction, and a low Z selectivity, regardless of the nature of the carbonyl partner. A mechanistic study helps explain observed reactivity, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report our results on the development of the Peterson olefination using gem&#8208;borylsilylmethane derivatives to synthesize di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. We show that the electronic properties of the carbonyl partner have no effect on the Peterson/boron&#8208;Wittig chemoselectivity whereas the nature of the silane group plays an important role. A DFT study helps explain observed reactivity, chemoselectivity and stereoseletivity

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of n&#8208;Nonanal and Aldehyde&#8208;Containing Polysiloxanes via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation Enhanced by A New Silicon&#8208;Tethered Multidentate Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two tetradentate P&#8208;ligands based on the 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (ViD4) and tetrakis(dimethyl(vinyl)silyl) silicate (SiV4) was reported for application in Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, which provide a facile process for the catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes and aldehyde&#8208;functional polysiloxanes with good regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes presents a significant challenge in homogeneous catalysis and organic synthesis due to the difficulty in regioselective control. Here we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed high chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene that would be highly useful intermediates in chemical industry. Notably, the easy made tetradentate P&#8208;ligands L1 and L2 can effectively suppress hydrogenation and isomerization reaction of olefins and give the desired aldehydes in high yield and good regioselectivity. Control experiments reveal the tetradentate P&#8208;ligands is important for controlling selectivity because the high regioselectivity is found to benefit from the presence of four phosphorus atoms manifesting in the formation of much more efficient coordination interactions to give relatively stable rhodium complexes.

         <title>Mannitol&#8208;Based CO Surrogate for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxycarbonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbon monoxide surrogate with high CO loading based on the abundant and polyhydroxylated mannitol has been developed. Its efficacy was demonstrated in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of aryl bromides and a series of aromatic esters were produced in moderate to good yields with phenols as the nucleophiles.







Abstract
Carbonylative transformation is already been accepted as a powerful toolbox in synthetic chemistry. However, the manipulation of toxic and smell&#8208;less carbon monoxide gas lagged it from wide range applications. Hence the developing of new and efficient CO surrogates become an attractive topic. Herein, we developed a novel mannitol&#8208;based carbon monoxide surrogate with an enhanced carbon monoxide loading capacity compared to known organic carbon monoxide surrogates. We successfully used it in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols only 0.5 equivalent of it required. This newly designed carbon monoxide surrogate offers additional possibility for further development in CO chemistry.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters Using Me3SiI</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the absence of any catalyst, polyester plastic wastes are depolymerized with Me3Si&#8722;I into a variety of value&#8208;added compounds. The reaction outcomes and the nature of the end products are influenced by the solvent, the temperature, the amount of Me3SiI and the length of the carbon backbone between the carboxyl fragments.







Abstract
Iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI) promotes the depolymerization of a variety of alkyl and aromatic polyesters, such as poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), polylactic acid (PLA) as well as polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates (PET, PBT), in the absence of catalyst. The monomer products, e.&#8201;g. the silylester monomers and/or their value&#8208;added derivatives, involving reactive iodo groups (alkyl iodides and acyl iodides), are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent (e.&#8201;g. CH2Cl2, CH3CN), temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C to 200&#8201;&#176;C) and the amount of Me3SiI. The depolymerization of PES gives the corresponding silylester which then cyclizes into succinic anhydride. With PLA, the ester CH3CH2CO2SiMe3 and propionyl iodide (CH3CH2COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. As expected, the decomposition of aromatic polymers PET and PBT affords the bis(trimethylsilyl) terephthalate compound (1,4&#8208;{CO2SiMe3}2C6H4). In the case of PET, the formation of the latter species is hampered by the I2, released by the decomposition of the generated diiodoethane. The initial addition of an iodine trap (1&#8208;pentyne) avoids these side reactions. This work demonstrates that the length of the carbon chain linking the carboxylic acid units is a crucial factor influencing the ease of the reaction and the nature of the products.

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters: Impact of Reaction Parameters &amp; Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters represents a highly atom&#8208;economical route towards &#946;&#8209;aldehydes with the potential application as precursors for derivatization to pharmaceuticals such as (R)&#8209;Baclofen or Pregabalin. Methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate as an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester has been rarely studied in hydroformylation, particularly with regard to a parameter screening for reaction optimization. In this work, the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8209;chlorocinnamate to the desired &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was investigated with a particular focus on the identification of parameters with a significant effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde amongst all products. The reaction time, solvent, and catalyst loading were initially screened followed by a systematic screening using design of experiments (DoE). The reaction output was analyzed in terms of pressure, temperature and the CO/H2 composition with an unmodified Rh&#160;catalyst revealing that while either regioselectivity or overall selectivity (termed selectivity) can attain high values, neither parameter can simultaneously reach optimal levels. As predicted by the model, the experimental results under two different conditions demonstrated excellent regioselectivity (96%) with medium selectivity (57%) and a high selectivity (78&#160;%) with good regioselectivity (93%). Expansion of substrate scope revealed a significant influence of the substituents and thus the electronic effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <title>Samarium Diiodide/Samarium&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Hydroborylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A samarium diiodide/samarium&#8208;mediated direct deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes with hydroborate ester has been reported. In this method, unactivated aldehydes and hydroborate ester have been employed as starting materials for the synthesis of primary alkyl borate esters. Broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance has been demonstrated that this is a robust method for deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
