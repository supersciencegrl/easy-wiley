         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Functionalisation of Triazoles Bearing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing N&#8208;Substituents: Challenges and Solutions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective lithiation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles provides an opportunity to introduce additional functionality, however this simple functionalisation strategy using triazoles bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;substituents has not been investigated until now. Herein, we demonstrate that the lithiated triazole intermediates can readily decompose, even at &#8722;78 &#176;C. In addition, lithiation&#8208;deuteration studies reveal lithiation can take place competitively on both the triazole and the electron&#8208;withdrawn aryl ring. Careful control of reaction conditions is therefore required to i) minimise decomposition pathways; and ii) facilitate regioselective functionalisation of the triazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of a Pentasaccharide O&#8208;Glycan from Acinetobacter baumannii</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multistep chemical synthetic efforts have produced a pentasaccharide O&#8208;glycan from the drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. Synthetic challenges include installation of the unusual uronic acid moiety as well as an effective protecting group strategy. This structure is critical for virulence, and synthetic material may provide insights on its biological roles and antigenicity.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram&#8208;negative bacteria associated with drug resistance and infection in healthcare settings. An understanding of both the biological roles and antigenicity of surface molecules of this organism may provide an important step in the prevention and treatment of infection through vaccination or the development of monoclonal antibodies. With this in mind, we have performed the multistep synthesis of a conjugation&#8208;ready pentasaccharide O&#8208;glycan from A. baumannii with a longest linear synthetic sequence of 19 steps. This target is particularly relevant due to its role in both fitness and virulence across an apparently broad range of clinically relevant strains. Synthetic challenges include formulating an effective protecting group strategy as well as the installation of a particularly difficult glycosidic linkage between the anomeric position of a 2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucuronic acid and the 4&#8208;position of D&#8208;galactose.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Borylation of Fluoroarenes: Insights into the Balance between Steric and Electronic Control of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium catalysed C&#8722;H borylation provides an effective method for late stage functionalization of fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes. The reaction occurs rapidly and efficiently with selectivity that can be best predicted using computed relative transition stage energies.







Abstract
The iridium catalysed C&#8722;H borylation of polyfluorinated arenes and heteroarenes occurs rapidly and efficiently. As with other borylation reactions, whilst steric parameters dominate, an underlying electronic influence on reaction selectivity can be observed. Notably borylation regioselectivity in fluorinated (hetero)arenes is determined by purely electronic effects except for ortho&#8208;borylation between two fluorine atoms where steric effects of fluorine substituents become apparent. Borylation at the para position with respect to fluorine is disfavoured whereas a strong electronic preference for borylation para to the azinyl nitrogen of pyridine is observed. When these features co&#8208;operate high selectivity can be expected. For these reactions, computations based on transition state, rather than intermediate, energies in iridium geometries showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed selectivities.

A new method has been developed for the synthesis of benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridine&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione scaffolds by means of transition metal catalyzed oxidative annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole with 1,4&#8208;quinones.







Abstract
Rh(III) catalyzed oxidative annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazoles with 1,4&#8208;quinones has been achieved for the synthesis of a novel class of benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;f]phenanthridine&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione frameworks through a sequential C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations in a single&#8208;step operation. This is the first report on the oxidative annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazoles with 1,4&#8208;quinones to produce highly functionalized phenanthridine&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione derivatives.

Firstly, novel 2&#8208;aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins were constructed as starting materials from 2&#8208;aroylaminoporphyrins under Vilsmeier&#8211;Haack reaction conditions. These 2&#8208;aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins have been efficiently converted to corresponding 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)porphyrins via a condensation cyclization reaction using 30% ammonia solution in DMSO at 50 &#176;C. The nickel(II), copper(II), free&#8208;base and zinc(II) analogues of 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins were successfully synthesized in 65&#8211;72% yields and structurally characterized on the basis of spectral data analysis. On photophysical evaluation, 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins demonstrated a 12&#8211;19 nm bathochromic shift in their electronic absorption spectra and up to 10 nm red shift in their emission spectra as compared to the simple meso&#8208;(tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl))porphyrins due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Reaction of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;free process of 1,6&#8208;conjugate reaction of para&#8208;quinone methides with gem&#8208;diborylalkanes is reported using a copper catalyst. The reaction proceeded with good yield for a variety of para&#8208;quinone methides and substituted gem&#8208;diborylalkanes under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report a ligand&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;borylalkyl copper species, catalytically generated from gem&#8208;diborylalkanes to para&#8208;quinone methides. The reaction proceeds with good yield for a variety of para&#8208;quinone methides and substituted gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with a catalytic amount of CuI as catalyst. This catalytic system provides a cost&#8208;effective process with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Isoindolinones and Their Bis(isoindolinone)ethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of substituted 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;isoindolinones (3&#8201;a&#8211;x), bis(isoindolinone)ethanes (4&#8201;a&#8211;d) and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones (6&#8201;a&#8211;h) derivatives is described.







Abstract
Highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of substituted 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;isoindolinones (3&#8201;a&#8211;x), bis(isoindolinone)ethanes (4&#8201;a&#8211;d) and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones (6&#8201;a&#8211;h) derivatives is portrayed from easily accessible starting materials such as 2&#8208;cyanobenzaldehydes (1&#8201;a&#8211;h) and different aryl/heteroaryl methyl ketones (2&#8201;a&#8211;k). The structure of Z&#8208;isomer of 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;isoindolinone 3&#8201;x was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and using O18&#8208;labelled water revealed that the reaction was initiated by attack of a conjugate base of aryl/heteroaryl methyl ketones (2&#8201;a&#8211;k) to aldehyde group of 1&#8201;a&#8211;h followed by intramolecular oxidative cyclization involving nitrile functionality to furnish isoindolinone derivatives in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Boron Catalysis in the Transformation of Carboxylic Acids and Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in boron catalysis with non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are summarized. Dehydrative amidation, reduction by silane reagents, C&#8722;C bond formation at &#945;&#8208;position, heteroatom&#8208;functionalization at &#945;&#8208;position, 1,4&#8208;addition, and other types of reactions are discussed with overview of mechanistic insights obtained during the past decade.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are ubiquitous motifs in functional organic molecules. However, the reactivities of these high oxidation state carbonyl compounds are far lower than ketones and aldehydes, and catalysts applicable to transform this class of carbonyl compounds are limited. On the other hand, boron catalysts have found various applications in the transformation of carbonyl compounds by taking advantage of the unique properties derived from their vacant p&#8208;orbitals. The continuous advancement of boron catalysis has realized several unprecedented direct transformations of carboxylic acids, amides, and esters in the past decade. In this review, representative achievements of boron catalysis are summarized according to reaction types by focusing on their applications to non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters.

         <title>Organophosphites: An Addition to the Arsenal of Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphites are nucleophilic in nature and can act as a good leaving group owing to the stability of the phosphite anion. This dual reactivity makes them good candidates for nucleophilic organocatalysis. However, phosphites were introduced only in 2004 as the umpolung catalyst for acylsilane substrates utilizing sequential Brook rearrangements. Very recently, phosphites have been reported to catalyze aza&#8208;rearrangements and radical reactions. Here, we discuss the reactivity parameters to understand its lack of use, as well as the potential for catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium) catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid is described. This protocol enables facile access for the preparation of diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity. Moreover, ionic liquid not only acts as the green solvent, but also acts as the eco&#8208;friendly chlorine source, thus avoiding the use of excess metal halides such as cupric chloride. Some preliminary mechanistic studies were performed, further revealed this cascade annulation possible pathways.</dc:description>

These alcohols can be coupled with N&#8208;protected glycine and subsequently subjected to zinc&#8208;chelated ester&#8208;enolate Claisen rearrangements to yield highly substituted unsaturated amino acids. By varying the nucleophiles used in the Matteson homologations, the method allows control over not only the stereogenic centers but also the side&#8208;chain substitution pattern in the newly formed &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsatu&#173;rated amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Odorless, Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Sulfenylation of Sulfoximines with Thiosulfonates under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An odorless and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;sulfenyl sulfoximines has been developed through the electrophilic sulfurization of thiosulfonates with sulfoximines. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions without transition metal catalysis, heating, and the use of toxic reagents.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfenylation of sulfoximines with thiosulfonates under mild conditions was disclosed. By our method, a series of aliphatic and aromatic N&#8208;sulfenyl sulfoximines were synthesized with good to excellent yields in the absence of transition metals. The applicability of this method was demonstrated by gram scale experiments.

         <title>Furylenevinylene Oligomers as Extended Conjugated Systems from Renewable Materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated furan materials from biomass platform: The synthesis and characterization of a series of oligofurylenevinylenes obtained by using common furan platforms derived from lignocellulose biomass such as furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is described. Compared to thiophene analogues, the influence of the less aromatic character of the furan cycle on the electronic properties is evidenced.







Abstract
A series of furylenevinylene oligomers (FV) were synthesized from common furan platforms derived of lignocellulosic biomass. Their electronic properties were evaluated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry and compared with thienylenevinylene analogues (TV). The difference between the electronic properties of these extended vinyl&#8208;heterocycle derivatives is mainly due to the less aromatic character of the furan core that allows an easier access to the quinoidic form and thus, procures a better electronic delocalization. As a main consequence, the access to the dication state is favoured for the furan derivatives with a quasi&#8208;coalescence of the two first oxidation potentials for 5 FV units.

         <title>Perfluorinated Sulfonate Resins as Reusable Heterogeneous Catalysts for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of DiPhenolic Esters (DPEs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of DPE, a valid candidate to replace bisphenol A, has been accomplished in good yield (78&#8201;%) and selectivity (87&#8201;%) by using Aquivion, a recyclable perfluorinated polymeric resins. The two step reaction, successfully applied to other alcohols and phenols, is carried out following a one&#8208;pot procedure and using phenols as solvent&#8208;reagent.







Abstract
Levulinic acid, easily obtained from cellulose, represents a fundamental chemical platform for a number of valuable building blocks. Among them, diphenolic acid and its esters (DPA and DPE) are valid candidates to replace Bisphenol A in polycarbonate and epoxy resin production processes. In this study, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of alkyl DPEs in the presence of a heterogenous acid catalyst starting from levulinic acid, an alcohol and phenol as solvent&#8208;reagent. The most interesting member of the DPE family, the ethyl 4,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)pentanoate, is selectively obtained in a good yield in the presence of a commercially available heterogeneous acid catalyst, the Aquivion, which can be reused for at least six times without any noticeable loss in activity.

Cationic Pd&#8208; or Ru&#8208;catalysts enable the regioselective arylation of a diene with two electronically distinct C&#8722;C&#8208;double bonds: Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H&#8208;alkenylation occurs at the electron&#8208;deficient olefin, whereas Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type arylation is observed at the electron&#8208;rich position.







Abstract
The regioselectivity of two mechanistically distinct alkenylation reactions catalyzed by in situ&#8208;formed cationic transition metal complexes was studied using N&#8208;allyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylethenesulfonamide as a model compound. Orthogonal selectivity was observed for the Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H&#8208;activating alkenylation with acetanilides, which occurs preferentially at the electron deficient double bond, and for a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type coupling with arene diazonium salts, which occurs preferentially at the more electron rich double bond of the N&#8208;allyl substituent.

         <title>Visible Light Driven Scalable and Reusable Ba&#8208;Doped CoMoO4 Nanoparticle Catalyzed One Pot Synthesis of Benzimidazoles, Benzothiazoles, and Quinazolinones Under Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and efficient oxidative coupling of various aryl methyl amines with diverse coupling partners such as o&#8208;phenylenediamine ( benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), 2 &#8208;aminobenzenethiol and 2 &#8208;aminobenzamide to corresponding heterocycles using scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalyst under visible light irradiation in one pot is described. A systematic investigation led to the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles and quinazolinones under air atmosphere in very good to excellent yields. The strategy is atom economical and found to be tolerance towards different functional groups, and wide range of substrate scope. Furthermore, the methodology was demonstrated for its suitability on scale up and reusability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the analysis of band structures of pristine and Ba doped CoMoO&#8324; systems showed that the doping of Ba in place of Co improved the catalytic performace of the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on visible light mediated oxidative coupling of structurally diverse aryl primary amines to heterocycles using a scalable and reusable heterogeneous &#160;catalyst under environmetally friendly conditions.</dc:description>

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on visible light mediated oxidative coupling of structurally diverse aryl primary amines to heterocycles using a scalable and reusable heterogeneous &#160;catalyst under environmetally friendly conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Flavin&#8208;Indole&#8208;Conjugates with Rigid Diamino Linkers as Cryptochrome Model Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of flavin&#8208;indole conjugates with a trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and a 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene linker is reported. Both compounds should serve as artificial model compounds for natural cryptochrome. It is assumed that cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins located in the retina show a light&#8208;dependent quantum effect which enables migratory birds to perceive the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and is thus used for navigation. Both model compounds were prepared by stepwise reductive aminations of indole carbaldehyde and a flavin&#8208;substituted acetaldehyde with the appropriate diamine linkers. The hitherto unknown 2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208; decahydronaphthalene was prepared in four steps from 2,6&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene as the achiral (meso) ax,ax&#8208;trans&#8208;diastereoisomer. The configuration of this key intermediate as well as synthetic precursors has been established by a series of X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses.</dc:description>

Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community as a versatile synthon for the construction of N&#8208;heterocycles. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations, as proposed by Sheehan in the 1960s have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community, owing to their diverse reactivity profile for constructing N&#8208;scaffolds of biological interest. During its initial growth, aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations were used effectively as a 3&#8208;unit synthon as 1,3 dipoles to create N&#8208;heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions, wherein aza&#8208;oxyallyl cation served as electrophilic counterpart. Recently, new variations of aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations reactivity have been reported, including its usage as a 1,4 dipole in cycloaddition reactions, domino reactions, and the unique alkylating ability of heteroatoms. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;Bridged Bis&#8208;quinolinium Dyes: Studies of the Dependence of Different Types of Conjugation on Spectroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;quinolinium salts are presented, the positive charges of which are combined by different types of conjugation. These result in characteristic differences in the LUMO geometries, charge distributions according to the rules of resonance as well as in UV/Vis and 13C NMR spectroscopic properties. The resonance frequencies of the triple bond can be used as indicator for the types of conjugation. The combination of conjugation and cross&#8208;conjugation by a 2,3&#8208;connectivity causes considerable bathochromic shifts of the absorption maxima.







Abstract
Dicationic bis&#8208;quinolinium salts possessing different types of conjugation are presented in which the hetareniums are separated by acetylenic or 1,4&#8208;diethynylbenzene spacers. Cross&#8208;conjugation is induced by interconnections via the 3&#8208;positions of the heteroareniums, and conjugation is realized by 2,2/2,4/4,4&#8208;interconnections. We also synthesized mixed cross&#8208;conjugated/conjugated 2,3/4,3&#8208;interconnected species. The different types of conjugation determine the charge distribution according to the rules of resonance which translate into characteristic 13C NMR as well as UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopic properties, LUMO geometries, and chemical properties. We found that the triple bond's resonance frequencies are sensitive 13C NMR spectroscopic indicators for the type of conjugation. Combining cross&#8208;conjugated and conjugated structure elements of dicationic bis&#8208;quinolinium dyes via triple bonds without additional benzene spacer results in considerable bathochromic shifts of the UV&#8208;Vis absorption maxima [&#916;&#955;max&#8776;100&#8197;nm]. A charge transfer was calculated from the HOMO of the conjugated into the LUMO of the cross&#8208;conjugated partial structure.

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Electrophilic Chlorination and Catalytic Nitration of N&#8208;Tosyl Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic nitration process for N&#8208;tosyl anilines was developed under mild, non&#8208;Br&#248;nsted acidic, and operationally easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle conditions. Under a common synthetic strategy, the synergistic combination of iodine(III) reagents with aluminum salts [AlX3 (X=&#8722;Cl,&#8722;NO3)] allowed also the accomplishment of the chlorination process.

An efficient iodine(III)&#8208;based protocol for the chlorination and catalytic nitration of N&#8208;tosyl anilines as well as the proposed reaction mechanism is described. The synergistic combination of the commercially available [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) with AlCl3, or (PhIO)n with Al(NO3)3, allowed the electrophilic introduction of chlorine and nitro group in the N&#8208;tosyl aniline core in non&#8208;acidic conditions. Our DFT calculations, performed for the chlorination process, indicate that this occurs through a cationic pathway in which the [Cl&#8208;PhI
OTFA&#8901;AlCl3] is the chlorinating species and is formed under neutral conditions.

     alt="Iodine(III)-Mediated Electrophilic Chlorination and Catalytic Nitration of N-Tosyl Anilines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first catalytic nitration process for &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosyl anilines was developed under mild, non-Br&#248;nsted acidic, and operationally easy-to-handle conditions. Under a common synthetic strategy, the synergistic combination of iodine(III) reagents with aluminum salts [AlX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X=&#8722;Cl,&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] allowed also the accomplishment of the chlorination process. DFT calculations provided the reaction pathway.

Synthetic access to 5/5/6&#8208;carbocyclic frameworks present in presilphiperfolanols, lycopodium alkaloids and cyclopiane diterpenes is described. Some of the key compounds were confirmed by various chemical transformations and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Overall, our approach is simple and rely on readily available starting materials, and involves a tandem&#8208;metathesis sequence.







Abstract
Herein, we describe new synthetic approaches to fused 5/5/6&#8208;carbocyclic frameworks present in various polycyclic natural products such as presilphiperfolanols, lycopodium alkaloids, and cyclopiane diterpenes. Our work features, a strategically introduced hydroxy group at the tert&#8208;carbon center of the tricyclic system which is present in presilphiperfolanols. In addition, one presilphiperfolanol analogue is reported to show the potential of strategies disclosed in this work. All the new compounds are characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectral data. The structures of critical compounds were confirmed by various chemical transformations and further supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Overall, our approach is simple and rely on readily available starting materials and involves a tandem&#8208;metathesis sequence. The synthetic studies disclosed here are applicable to the synthesis of natural products and to design medicinally important targets.

Abstract
The synthesis of pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazole derivatives from the cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and vinylene transfer of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with vinylene carbonate has been proposed. Most products of pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazoles were achieved in good yields under simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;operate conditions. Scale&#8208;up preparation and several preliminary mechanistic studies involving C&#8722;H bond activation and electronic effects between different substrates were also performed. This protocol offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of diverse useful pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazole derivatives.

This review summarizes research on the different synthetic routes to access boron&#8208;doped heptagons including borepins, azaborepins, and oxaborepins, with the emphasis on the structure&#8208;property relationships at the molecular level.







Abstract
As the models for studying defected graphene, &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behaviors, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Doping heptagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with boron not only makes &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with the boron&#8208;doped heptagonal ring have structural similarity to their all&#8208;carbon analogues, but also could significantly change their electronic properties and intermolecular interactions. This review summarizes research on the different synthetic routes to access boron&#8208;doped heptagons including borepins, azaborepins, and oxaborepins, with the emphasis on the structure&#8208;property relationships at the molecular level.

         <title>Assessment of the Electrochemical Synthesis Route to Silicones Starting from Silica as Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical investigation on the direct electrochemical conversion of silica as raw materials to cyclic methylsiloxanes is reported. Room temperature synthesis of silicones could be achieved via the direct reduction of supporting electrolyte cations to methyl radical species. Requirements for the supporting electrolyte are high, mechanistic insights to vital intermediates and conditions are outlined.







Abstract
We successfully achieved methylation of various SiO2 sources to cyclic methylsiloxanes via electroreduction reaction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the reaction does not start from methanol as methyl radical source, that results in methoxylation of the electrolyte solvent. Methylammonium cations were found to enable the direct conversion, strongly dependent on the radical intermediate stabilization by the electrolyte. THF/Bu4NCF3SO3 is the sole applicable system with yields below 14&#8201;% referred to the methylammonium cations for the highest amount of product obtained so far. Mechanistic insights show that methylation does not occur via the supposed hydrolysis of dimethoxydimethylsilane intermediate, but via a direct conversion reaction, as comparative studies of a Fenton&#8208;type procedure clearly indicate. Further, cyclic methylsiloxane products are prone to subsequent electrochemical equilibration, strongly directed by the electrolyte solvent.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Enones by &#945;&#8208;Addition of Alcohols to Alkynones Using 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol and PPh3 as Co&#8208;catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;addition of alcohols to alkynones was demonstrated. A series of &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones can directly be synthesized in moderate to high yields under mild conditions. Mechanism studies were carried out by various means.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Alkoxy enones are quite useful building blocks in organic chemistry. The existing methods for syntheses of these compounds remain somewhat limited. Over the past years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has emerged as a practical and powerful tool for constructing diverse molecules with the advantages of environmental&#8208;friendly, metal&#8208;free, and mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, alkynone is easy to prepare, can undergo a variety of reactions, and is a commonly used substrate for organic synthesis. &#945;&#8208;Addition of alcohols to alkynones is a direct way to construct &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones. In this study, it was delightful to find that using PPh3 (10&#8197;mmol&#8201;%) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (20&#8197;mmol&#8201;%) could redirect from &#946;&#8208;addition to &#945;&#8208;addition. With this approach, a variety of &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones could be obtained directly with good yields and regioselectivity. Under optimal conditions, the generality of the reaction was investigated. Substrate scope studies showed that the reaction was well tolerated with many alcohols. Mechanistic study is also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Physovenine through Electrochemical C&#8722;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 47, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the alkaloid physovenine demonstrates the utility of a late&#8208;stage electrochemical C&#8722;O bond formation method. Among the substrates surveyed, a correlation between the nature of nitrogen substitution and an alternative electrochemical C&#8722;O bond formation pathway was identified where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2&#8208;position of the indoline.







Abstract
We investigated an electrochemical C&#8722;O bond formation approach to (&#177;)&#8208;physovenine. The reaction conditions are mild compared to canonical routes, which typically utilize strong hydride reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride. This enabled extension of the electrochemical cyclization to a substrate bearing the fully functionalized phenyl ring of the natural product. The electrochemical cyclization is diastereoselective and starting from enantiopure substrate would provide a single enantiomer of physovenine. In the course of an initial formal synthesis, we identified conditions to afford modest enantioselective substrate synthesis that demonstrate the feasibility of an enantioselective synthesis. Among the substrates investigated, acetyl&#8208;, tosyl&#8208; or Boc&#8208;nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8722;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2&#8208;position of the indoline. This work expands the utility of electrochemical C&#8722;O bond formation and provides a foundation for further applications to functionalized cyclic ether construction.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions: Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions: two interactions of today's research in anion recognition supramolecular chemistry. The combination of these two interactions gives rise to interesting cooperativity effects that remain difficult to rationalize and quantify. In this Review, concepts of cooperativity are illustrated by reporting examples of combination of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Anion recognition represents an active area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing for a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This Review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted Phthalides. A Key Access to Herbaric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we investigated a new organophotocatalyzed protocol enabling the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. From this work, the 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene&#160; (4CzIPN) turned out to be a particularly efficient organophotocatalyst to promote lactone formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation within 6h. The methodology was extended to nineteen diversly substituted phthalides with yields ranging from 23 to 81%. Ultimately, it was found that this protocol could enable the formation of racemic herbaric acid.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient and practical approach&#160;for&#160;the generation of&#160;triaryl allenyl sulfones from easily accessible propargylic alcohols with sodium sulfinates as&#160;a&#160;sulfonyl source in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid was developed in this work. The reaction proceeded&#160;via&#160;allenyl carbocation as the key intermediate and was followed by a nucleophilic attack of sodium sulfinates to produce allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields. The obvious advantages of this reaction are the mild conditions, operational simplicity, good yield, a wide functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Organic Synthesis: Current Challenges and New Trends</title>

Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to introduce the different categories of dual catalytic systems and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds and enhanced stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This strategy can be divided into cooperative catalysis, relay catalysis, and sequential catalysis according to the actual mode of operation and the communication between the catalysts. In recent years, such strategy has been applied in a large number of studies since it has the advantages of: 1)&#8197;increasing reactivity and enabling challenging transformations; 2)&#8197;offering a powerful way of controlling the stereoselectivity of asymmetric reactions, which is challenging for traditional catalytic systems; 3)&#8197;catalyze the stereodivergent synthesis of molecules bearing one or more stereocenters from the same starting materials. This Perspective, which intends to introduce the reader to EurJOC special collection on Dual Catalysis , aims to summarize and introduce the different categories of dual catalysis and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds in a selective manner. Finally, current challenges and new trends in dual catalysis will be also presented.

         <dc:description>A novel efficient method for the synthesis of licochalcone C in good yield on up to 30 g scale was developed. The reaction sequence included relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DOM) of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation &#8211; formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection of a hydroxyl group located between the formyl and prenyl groups, its methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone. Synthesis of structurally related retrochalcones, i.e., licoagrochalcones B, C, and D, was also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Domino Heck&#8208;Suzuki Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium catalysis enables efficient and versatile domino reactions that are initiated by an intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and then terminated by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. The stereochemistry of this cascade is concerned under three aspects: Firstly, as stereoselective formation of carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;double bonds, when the initial carbometalation occurs at an alkyne moiety. Secondly as diastereoselective and thirdly enantioselective formation of stereogenic carbon centers when the intramolecular Heck step is directed to an alkene moiety. Valuable protocols lead to &#8211; otherwise not easily accomplished &#8211; stereo control in the formation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted double bonds according to the first conception. The diastereoselective versions permit the formation of multiple stereocenters in mono&#8208; and polycycles. Enantioselective protocols were developed only recently. The fact that the newly created stereocenters are highly&#8208;substituted, tertiary or quaternary ones, makes the methods that are presented in this review useful and versatile tools in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Complementary One&#8208;Pot Four&#8208;Component Reaction Sequences for Rapid, General and Direct Spiropyran Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component processes for spiropyran synthesis were developed. These complementary reaction sequences enable efficient and straightforward synthesis of structurally diverse spiropyrans from simple and readily available precursors.







Abstract
Three one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component reaction sequences for spiropyran synthesis have been developed, based around three different methods for in situ generation of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoles (indole N&#8208;alkylation, Fischer indolisation and indole C&#8208;alkylation). The reaction sequences give access to a broad swathe of spiropyran structures. Each sequence is operationally straightforward, rapid and high yielding. We have synthesized 58 structurally diverse spiropyrans bearing a wide range of useful functional groups, and their utility were demonstrated in the targeted synthesis of potential ratiometric fluorescence probes for metal ions and spiropyran&#8208;cholesterol conjugates. Finally, we showed that our one&#8208;pot N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation&#8208;condensation sequence can underpin combinatorial spiropyran synthesis through generation of a 16&#8208;member spiropyran library.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Photocatalysis for the Direct C&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles with an Organic Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis for direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation represents an ideal way to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing chemical compounds, but the conventional batch processes are inefficient with limited light penetration and indispensably irradiated for a long while. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow protocol for photocatalytic direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of heterocycles in the presence of an organic photoredox catalyst: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(diphenylamino)&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile (3DPA2FBN). In this approach, benefiting from the merger of organic photoredox catalysis and continuous&#8208;flow techniques, a variety of trifluoromethylated heterocycles were rapidly synthesized up to 85% yield with 80 min residence time under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder / Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA) / thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Scalable protocols of straightforward synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones are presented. The key step is lipase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salt in organic solvent followed by acidification of the product, extraction and acidic relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The mixture of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acid and &#947;&#8208;lactone is separated either by extraction with solution of sodium bicarbonate or by distillation. A switch of enantioinduction of Candida antarctica lipase B along homologous nucleophiles from R configuration of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid salt to S configuration of the C7 and longer&#8208;chain homologues has been disclosed.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Purines and Pyrimidines: From the Origin of Life to New Sustainable Approaches for Drug&#8208;Discovery Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is widely accepted that purines and pyrimidines, the building blocks that gave origin to life on our planet, were created through multicomponent reactions (MCRs) on early abiotic Earth. These heterocyclic scaffolds gradually evolved into a wide range of biologically relevant molecules regulating many different physiological processes and thus becoming widely exploited as templates for the development of new drugs. Accordingly, over the years, the synthetic community has dedicated many efforts in the attempt to hypothesize and replicate the original abiotic synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thus developing a number of multicomponent synthesis to access these scaffolds. The following evolution of synthetic chemistry towards green approaches for the production of new molecules and the recent interest in pharmaceutical sustainability underlines the importance of multicomponent synthesis of new heterocycles. This review article provides an overview of the most important multicomponent approaches for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine derivatives for potential pharmacological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Approach for N&#8210;H Functionalization of Sulfoximines: An Access to Sulfoximinated&#8208;Oxime Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, metal&#8208;free and green approach has been established for N&#8210;H functionalization of sulfoximines under mild reaction conditions to offer sulfoximinated&#8208;oxime conjugates. The reaction works well in EtOH at room temperature and proceeds smoothly without using any base or expensive ligands. This protocol has been applied on various aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208; sulfoximines as well as on variety of chloro&#8208;oximes. Both the substrates tolerated a wide range of functional groups resulted in good to excellent yields. It can serve as a directing group in organic synthesis, as precursor or building block, demonstrating the product&#8217;s applicability and importance in the field. The applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in the sulfoximination of some natural products. This strategy could be useful in drug discovery or medicinal chemistry for fine&#8208;tuning the physicochemical properties of natural product scaffolds or lead candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new energetic oxetane derivatives with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were synthesized and characterized. An azide group and a tetrazole moiety were introduced into the starting material oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to obtain a 3&#8208;disubstituted oxetane. The tetrazole ring of this energetic oxetane was further methylated, aminated and hydroxylated.







Abstract
Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98&#8201;%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 14N NMR, 15N NMR, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC, FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X&#8208;ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for Versatile Thioester Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioester constitutes a fundamentally unique intermediate, engaged in various biosynthesis processes in living systems as well as a versatile synthon in modern organic synthesis. Transition metal catalysis and radical reaction manifolds have enabled to enrich the repertoire of synthetic methods for thioesters. In this review, we have accommodated the recent reports on modern strategies towards thioester synthesis from a plethora of readily available feedstocks, such as alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, phenols or commodity chemicals/synthetic building blocks like organic aldehydes, halides or organoboron reagents under various catalysis domains. Furthermore, the momentous advancements of employing progenitors of odorous thiols as well as CO&#8208;surrogates have contextually been emphasized, alongside the utilization of native free thiols and CO gas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amidation of conjugated olefin with 2&#8208;pyridone is described. A series of E&#8208;Enamides were synthesized in a highly stereocontrolled manner. The reaction also accommodates other cyclic and acyclic amides. Z&#8208;Enamides were predominantly prepared for primary amides probably due to the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of enamide and the following oxidative annulation with diphenylacetylene demonstrates the synthetic utility of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radical Mediated Decarboxylative Homolytic Substitution of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Ester with Ar2X2 (X=S, Se)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free approach to construct C&#8208;X (X=S, Se) bonds with the broadly available N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and disulfides/diselenides (Ar2X2,X = S or Se) using bis(pinacolato)diboron as the reductant. Density functional theory calculations and control experiments reveal that such a C&#8208;X bond formation process is reductive decarboxylationmediated from pyridine&#8208;boryl radical to yield alkyl or aryl radical. The resulting carbon radical then reacts with disulfides or diselenides via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) mechanism to afford the corresponding sulfides or selenides. This method displays a high functional group tolerance and broad substrate applicability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70 years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products.&#160;Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20 years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works,&#160;are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the application of 1,1&#8208;bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as a new type of terminating reagents to realize three&#8208;component coupling reaction with aryl iodide and different electrophiles. A series of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzylboronates can be synthesized and the ortho&#8208;substituent can be varied by using bromoacetic esters or O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine as electrophiles with slightly modified reaction conditions. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance and the obtained benzyl boronate products can be easily transformed to various synthetically useful compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of the Reactivity in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Acyl&#8208;isocyanide Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions are the preferred method to generate five&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings. Surprisingly, cycloadditions based on acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides have remained underexplored by the chemical community. Acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides readily react with dipolarophiles, such as substituted alkenes, to yield &#916;1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives. As an explanation for the observed reactivity of this reaction is lacking, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed to scrutinize the mechanistic features of the transformation. Herein we explain the experimental outcome of the reaction using a variety of reactivity theories and predict opposed regioselectivity for electron&#8208;poor and electron&#8208;rich dipolarophiles. With the insights obtained, we hope to incentivize the design of new cycloaddition reactions based on the acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides motif.</dc:description>

         <title>CuMoO4 Catalyzed&#160; Csp 2&#8208;Se Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Bromide and Iodide with Diaryldiselenides in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein demonstrated, an oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic CuMoO4 catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling of diaryldiselenides with aryl&#8208;halides. The current discovery is noteworthy, as the catalyst is eco&#8208;friendly, easily accessible, air&#8208;stable, and recyclable. The methodology exhibits broad substrate scope and the catalytic system tolerates common functional groups. The protocol uses aryl iodide and bromides as electrophile instead of boronic acids. This is the first example of using an oxo&#8208; bridged copper based bimetallic catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water. C&#8208;Cl bond remains intact during reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expedient method for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from homoallylic carbonic acid esters by means of photo&#8208;aerobic selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid multicatalysis is reported. Until now, conceptually related methods commonly relied either on the stoichiometric addition of electrophiles onto the substrate&#8217;s alkene moiety or the presence of pre&#8208;installed leaving groups in allylic position of said alkene to &#8211; in part, catalytically &#173;&#8211; initiate an intramolecular attack by an adjacent carbonic acid ester group. In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8211;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Vanadium Catalyst for C&#8211;&#160;and S&#8211;alkylation of Benzhydrols in Water: An Experimental Study and Green Metrics Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the vanadium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrative C&#8211; and S&#8211;alkylation by nucleophilic substitution of benzhydrols with arenes and thiols are reported. The alkylation was achieved with the divanadium oxoperoxo complex [K3(V+5)2(O22&#8722;)4(O2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH)] in water under aerobic conditions. The newly developed transformation could accommodate a broad substrate scope including (hetero)arenes and thiols (34 examples). Both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzhydrols furnished excellent yields of the alkylated product under mild reaction conditions. The scope of this strategy was further extended to synthesize bis&#8208;benzylated arenes (polyarylated products) in high yields and regioselectivities. The green metrics determination of all the alkylated products suggests the technical and environmental benefits of the present protocol. The longevity experiment reveals the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles. To understand the mechanism of the present reaction, detailed spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken. This simple protocol, which affords the desired products with water as the by&#8208;product, can be achieved under mild conditions without the need for a base or other additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Conjugated Dihydroazulene/Vinylheptafulvene Photoswitches in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photoswitches was prepared and studied in various media regarding their photophysical, photochemical, and thermal properties. To pave the way towards the use of DHAs as building blocks in bio(macro)molecules, we synthesized peptide conjugates including the 17&#8208;amino acid ALFA peptide and found excellent switching properties of the biohybrid constructs in aqueous media.&#8201;







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Arylnaphthalene Lignans through a Photochemical Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of arylnaphthalene lignans (ANL) Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3) are described. These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene skeleton (2H&#8208;ANL). The key step of the syntheses is the Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction between arylalkyne moieties, which are connected by a suberate linker unit. The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.







Abstract
The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (ANLs) were developed: Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene moiety (2H&#8208;ANLs). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.[1]

The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (&lt;b&gt;ANL&lt;/b&gt;s) were developed: Vitrofolal E (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Noralashinol C (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and Ternifoliuslignan E (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2-position of the naphthalene moiety (&lt;b&gt;2H-ANL&lt;/b&gt;s). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo-Dehydro-Diels-Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals bearing p&#8208;brominated positions were synthesized in good yield from halogenated triphenylmethanes obtained by multistep Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were reported as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation. The most blue&#8208;shifted emission among trityl radicals was achieved for the highly fluorinated trityl radical.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two p&#8208;brominated positions, i.&#8201;e. the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data as well as rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.

         <dc:description>Abstract. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are a fascinating example of strained organic molecules that have found many practical applications due to unusual parallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement of two peri&#8208;aryl rings in close proximity almost perpendicular to the central naphthalene backbone. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes show notable potential as photoluminescent and chiral sensors, stereodynamic switches, nonlinear optic chromophores, blue&#8208;transparent frequency doublers, materials for creating high&#8208;performance blue and green OLEDs, chiral ligands and so on. Molecules of this type have also been used as convenient models for studying &#960;&#8211;&#960;, dipole&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are also interesting as objects to study atropisomeric transformations: if the peri&#8208;aryl rings have ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents, then the anti&#8208;conformer becomes C2&#8208;symmetrical (hence chiral), and the syn&#8208;isomer upon symmetrical substitution is achiral. Despite the extensive knowledge accumulated and the usefulness of these compounds that have become apparent, there are still no reviews on 1,8&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes. In this review, data on synthetic methods, applications, atropisomerism and structural characteristics of 1,8diaryl&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;dihetarylnaphthalenes are summarized.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>

         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

         <title>Stereoselective Production of Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;Azanucleosides through Electrochemical C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;azanucleosides was achieved. Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox&#8208;induced N&#8208;&#945; hydroxylation and continuous C&#8208;glycosidation gave desired C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Herein, we report a practical method for de novo preparation of imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late&#8208;stage anomeric derivatization by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox-induced &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&#945; hydroxylation and continuous &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidation gave desired &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-azanucleosides with high &#946;-selectivity (&amp;gt;98&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a practical method for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; preparation of imino-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ribitol and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late-stage anomeric derivatization by regio- and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-azanucleosides with high &#946;-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants of &#945;'&#8208;substituted BTEs (open and closed) correlate linearly with the excitation energies of the absorption maxima applying the spectroscopic Hammett equation.







Abstract
Series of photochromic 1,2&#8208;bis(thienyl)ethenes possessing perfluorocyclopentene backbones, either hydrogen or methyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the thiophenes, and a variety of substituents in their &#945;'&#8208;positions were prepared, which cover the range from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing (Me, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;OTBS, &#8722;TMS, &#8722;Br, 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;yl, pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;COOH). As a linear free energy relationship the spectroscopic Hammett equation gives fair to excellent fits to the excitation energy of the absorption maxima of the ring&#8208;opened as well as the ring&#8208;closed forms of the BTEs, when Hammett substituent constants &#963;p were replaced by Brown's modified substituent constants &#963;p+ and &#963;p&#8722;. Vice versa, hitherto unknown Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants can be estimated from the UV spectra. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured absorption maxima with values which we calculated by three different methods (DFT STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD/def2&#8208;TZVPP, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31G*, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;311++G**).

         <title>Photoredox/Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylamino&#8208;Cyanation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, trifluoromethylaminating reagent, and TMSCN has been established. A variety of trifluoromethylaminated allenes were obtained in good yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes with readily available trifluoromethylaminating reagent and TMSCN was developed. This reaction proceeded at mild conditions, affording the corresponding trifluoromethylaminated allenes in good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic application of the resulting products has also been demonstrated by the transformation to N&#8722;CF3 oxazolidinones.

         <title>Electrochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Azidoesterification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol has been developed for the azidoesterification of alkenes, providing a practical method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
We report an efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic approach for azidoesterification of alkenes. The reaction proceeds by electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of commercially available carbazates to produce alkoxycarbonyl radicals. Upon addition across alkenes, the generated transient carbon&#8208;centered radicals get trapped by azido metal complexes to furnish the alkene difunctionalization products. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of alkenes into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;azido esters in good to excellent yields, thereby providing a practical access to &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials.

Light as air: A straightforward metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access new high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

Combining a facile light-mediated enolization of o-methyl benzophenones/Diels-Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste-reducing and cost-effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement of Indoles to Spirooxindoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.







Abstract
The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Continuous&#8208;Flow Photo&#8208;Thiol&#8208;Ene Functionalization of Conformation&#8208;Controlled Cinchona Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

Flow thiol-ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

&lt;p&gt;Ligandless, telescoped, one-pot reductive Mizoroki-Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco-friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2-(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.
